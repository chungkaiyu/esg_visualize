Common Good 
Innovation drives us forward at TSMC. It beholds the expectations of our stakeholders. As we pursue our dreams with courage and resilience, TSMC continues to empower development in 5G, Arti cial Intelligence, and beyond, and to use cutting-edge technology, to paint an intelligent and connected future in which human lives are made more convenient, comfortable, and safe. 
As members of the global community, let us join hands as one to map out a sustainable blueprint for the common good of our planet. 
Innovation Paints   a Future of Sustainability 
We pride ourselves as a driver of a sustainable future. We galvanize each and every bit of positive energy to unleash innovation that can bring positive change that can be shared by all in a brilliant world. 
As a company pursues pro tability and growth, it must also  
be concerned with the environment, society, and corporate  
governance. Since TSMC s establishment, the Company  
has not only strived for the highest achievements in its core  
business of dedicated IC foundry services, but has dedicated  
itself to corporate governance, and actively developed positive  
relationships with all stakeholders, including employees,  
shareholders, customers, suppliers, and society to ful ll its  
responsibility as a corporate citizen and pursue a sustainable  
future. For TSMC, the  rst step in corporate social responsibility  
is to carry out our core values demonstrate our business  
principles through our actions, and for every colleague to  
continue enhancing our three competitive advantages of  
 Technology Leadership, Manufacturing Excellence, and  
Customer Trust . In this way, we drive beautiful changes in  
society and the environment through our leadership position in  
the industry. 
Over the years, TSMC has held to its vision of uplifting society,  
and applied technology and innovation to help humanity  
overcome many challenges. The Company has taken  
numerous concrete actions and actively given back to society  
in a spirit of gratitude, and we have become a benchmark for  
the industry. As we strive to do our best in corporate social  
responsibility, we are also encouraging our employees to  
make innovative breakthroughs in how they think about  
things, and how they do things. At the same time, we are

nurturing our empathy and broadening our horizons. I hope  
that we can have greater social participation from TSMC  
employees based on our professionalism, to develop more  
holistically as individuals. 
Because of this, we established the Corporate Social  
Responsibility Executive Committee in 2019, teamed with  
senior management in many di erent functions to set the  
Company s future CSR strategy. It is acting in tandem with the  
CSR Committee to drive CSR actions and cultivate CSR culture.  
We had taken a fresh look at our core abilities, UN SDGs, as  
well as the areas where our two Foundations can make a  
di erence and encouraging employees to use professional  
knowledge and passion to help the Company ful ll its social  
responsibility and give back to society. With that, we also  
revisited our 2030 goals with concrete measures to ful ll our  
commitment.  
I would like to thank every one of our colleagues diligently  
doing each thing right in every corner of our company. In  
our CSR report, you will see how everyone took action for a  
sustainable future in the past year from various aspects. I hope  
that everyone in TSMC will take it as personal responsibility to  
make a full commitment. On the road towards sustainability  
and the common good, let us continue to drive positive  
changes together.

Each year, TSMC renews its commitment to society and the  
environment through the CSR committee. We insist on an  
innovative business model, and in 2019, we helped customers  
innovate 10,761 products using 272 di erent process technologies,  
o ering more energy-e cient technology applications to deliver a  
safer and more convenient world to humanity. This year, we made  
an even greater breakthrough, and extended our sustainable  
development goals to 2030. With our core values, we hope to align  
ourselves with the United Nations  Sustainable Development  
Goals and work together to overcome future challenges. 
We have also committed NT  19.66 billion toward environmental  
protection and successfully implemented 763 innovative programs  
in energy conservation, water conservation, and waste reduction.  
Our overseas facilities have once again achieved zero emissions,  
realizing a green and low-carbon business model. In addition, we  
continue to evaluate Environmental Pro t   Loss (EP L) enabling  
us to monetize the environmental impact of manufacturing,  
and make external costs part of our new mindset for sustainable  
management. In 2019, TSMC achieved the highest score ever  
recorded by the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) and became  
the  rst semiconductor company to receive platinum certi cation.  
In terms of renewable energy, we have established a task force to  
work closely with the government, accelerate development, and  
help slow down climate change.

Sustainability is fundamental to TSMC s operations and we  
are equally committed to the long-term success of our supply  
chain. In 2019, all tier 1 suppliers completed self-assessments on  
sustainability, and all high-risk suppliers received on-site audits.  
We have also continued to require more from our key suppliers,  
requesting that they work closely with their upstream suppliers  
to create value in the semiconductor supply chain. What is also  
worth mentioning is that we are also employing digital technology  
for supply chain management and expanding our existing  
management structure. In order to raise the bar for supply chain  
sustainability, we are creating a  Supply Chain 360  system that  
can track data, integrate an online learning platform, and o er  
reporting channels for suppliers. 
TSMC issued its  rst  Diversity and Inclusion at TSMC  in 2019.  
We hope to build an innovative and inclusive workplace where  
our colleagues can work safely, make the best use of their talents,  
and grow together with TSMC. We have also encouraged our  
employees to deepen their participation in society. Our colleagues  
have served 17,593 times and devoted 83,797 hours in volunteer  
service this year. Through the TSMC Foundation and TSMC Charity  
Foundation, we are advocating for the disadvantaged,  lial  
piety, education in underserved areas, youth, arts   culture, and  
environmental protection through a diverse range of programs.  
We hope to light all corners of society by harnessing the power of  
making  1 1  greater than 2. 
TSMC believes that a company exists to bring positive changes to  
our world. We know that the future is  lled with challenges, but  
we will always stay true the cornerstones of TSMC   Integrity, and  
Responsible Operations. With each and every TSMC employee  
steadfast at their roles, we believe that beautiful changes can  
continue to happen. It is a beautiful virtuous cycle that will  
continue to energize TSMC s march towards sustainability.

Good  nancial performance is the key to corporate sustainability. TSMC pursues good  nancial performance  
mainly through revenue growth and consistent improvement in pro tability to create greater economic value for its  
stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers, government, society, and others. To help  
investors better understand TSMC s long-term investment value, TSMC set clear strategic  nancial objectives: (1)  
average return on equity (ROE) to be at least 20% across cycles  (2) compound annual growth rate of net income to  
be between 5% and 10% for the years 2015 through 2020.

In 2019, TSMC s ROE reached 20.9%  revenue growth  
calculated in NT dollars reached 3.7%, while net  
income decreased 1.7%. Net income decreased in  
2019 mainly as the Company s capacity utilization was  
impacted by (1) trade tensions between countries,  
(2) rising global macroeconomic uncertainties, and  
(3) inventory adjustments in the semiconductor  
supply chain. Meanwhile, the Company witnessed an  
acceleration of the deployment of 5G networks and  
smartphones in several major markets around the  
world. The acceleration will trigger a faster worldwide  
penetration of 5G smartphones with higher silicon  
content and drive strong 5G-related and HPC demand  
for TSMC s advanced technologies in the next several  
years. Therefore, the Company still expects to achieve  
its strategic  nancial objectives in 2020.

Tax Policy 
2019 Corporate Social Responsibility  Report 
 TSMC's effective tax rate in 2019 was 11.5%,  lower than 11.7% in 2018, mainly due to lower  surtax imposed on unappropriated earnings that  primarily resulted from the reduced statutory  rate of surtax from 10% to 5%. Besides, the  effective tax rate in 2019 was lower than the  R.O.C. statutory corporate income tax rate of  20%, due primarily to a five-year tax exemption  for capital investments made in previous years,  and tax credit for research and development  expenditures according to regulations under the  R.O.C. Statute for Upgrading Industries and the  Statute for Industrial Innovation.  
 TSMC is subject to tax laws and regulations in  various jurisdictions, in which it operates or  conducts business. Any unfavorable changes of  tax laws and regulations in these jurisdictions  could increase the Company's effective tax rate  and have an adverse effect on its operating  results. TSMC establishes an enterprise risk  management (ERM) program to manage the  tax risks. For more details on risk management,  please refer to "Risk Management" section in  TSMC's 2019 Annual Report.

TSMC advocates and acts upon the principles of operational transparency and respect for shareholder rights. We believe that the basis for successful corporate governance is a  
sound and effective Board of Directors. In line with this principle, the TSMC Board delegates various responsibilities and authority to two Board Committees, the Audit Committee  
and the Compensation Committee. Each Committee s chairperson regularly reports to the Board on the activities and actions of the relevant committee. The Board of Directors  
plays the role to oversee and provide guidance to the Company s comprehensive sustainable management strategies. TSMC established the Corporate Social Responsibility  
Executive Committee in 2019. TSMC s Chairman chairs the CSR Executive Committee, and the Chairperson of the CSR Committee serves as Executive Secretary. The Chairperson of

Note: Passages by sequence of the chapters 
Each year, TSMC complies with GRI Standards for Stakeholder Inclusiveness, Sustainability Context, Materiality, and Completeness. Through three phases that include identi cation, analysis, and con rmation, we assess sustainability issues and carry  
out materiality analysis to align TSMC s strategies for sustainability management with our long-term goals. The GRI Standards also serve as a guideline for compiling our CSR report, allowing us to examine TSMC s current progress in sustainability,  
promote improvement within organizations, and create shared value for society and TSMC.  
6 Categories of Stakeholders 
Based on "internal external groups  or individuals that have an impact on  TSMC or being impacted by TSMC," we  have identi ed six major stakeholders  including employees, shareholder  investors, customers, suppliers  vendors, government   society  (community, academic institutions,  media, NGO NPO), etc. 
Step 1: De ne Major Stakeholders 
Phase 1: Identi cation 
In compliance with the AA 1000 SES (Stakeholder Engagement Standards, SES) and  taking into account the level of importance and relevance, TSMC regards the following  six stakeholders: employees, shareholders investors, customers, suppliers vendors, and  government   society (community, academic institutions, media, NGO NPO) as the major  stakeholders for communication. In 2019, we identi ed 16 sustainability issues to serve as  the basis for materiality analysis. The issues of sustainable products was divided and then  integrated into innovation management and product quality, allowing disclosure to be  more focused and comprehensive. Other result-oriented issues that are part of GRI general  disclosures such as corporate governance, risk management, stakeholder communication,   nancial performance, and taxes will be regularly disclosed in the Company's annual report,  website, CSR Report, and CSR website, instead of being mapped in the materiality matrix. 
Materiality Analysis and Stakeholder Communication 
2019 Corporate Social Responsibility  Report 
Step 2: Collect Sustainability Issues 
We have compiled 16 issues related to  TSMC's sustainability from four major  sources: international sustainability  standards and regulations (GRI Standards,  ISO26000, UN Global Compacts, RBA,  and UN SDGs), sustainability-oriented  investment agencies (DJSI, CDP, TCFD,  MSCI ESG Index, and SDGs Invest), TSMC's  development targets and vision, and  stakeholder communication.

819 Surveys  Collected  2,000 Employee  Communication Meetings 
In 2019, we collected 436 valid surveys from  critical stakeholders de ned by TSMC. We  also hosted over 2,000 communication  meetings to understand our colleagues'  expectations for TSMC and collected  383 supplier surveys during the Supplier  Management Forum to serve as basis for  analysis on the level of interest. 
Step 3: Assess Level of Interest 
Phase 2: Analysis 
Applying sustainability to the Company's daily operations is the core mindset of promoting sustainability management at TSMC. In 2019, we  attempted to involve ourselves in daily operations in order to truly understand what our stakeholders feel through various channels. This is  in addition to the usual survey on sustainability that we hand out to all stakeholders and we were able to collect 436 surveys this year. For  employees, TSMC hosted over 2,000 cross-level meetings, face-to-face discussions, interviews, and various forms of meetings to strengthen  our understanding of what our colleagues expect from TSMC and their recommendations for promoting sustainability within the company. For  suppliers, we've included, for the  rst time, a section on sustainability in surveys for suppliers to which we were able to collect 383 responses  during the Supplier Management Forum. We also raised the level required for participating in discussions on materiality in 2019. Chairman  Mark Liu leads the CSR Executive Committee, along with CSR Committee Chairperson and Senior Vice President Lora Ho, to analyze the impacts  of each issue on operations (pro tability, revenue, customer satisfaction, employee cohesion, risk) with a total of 114 colleagues that include  TSMC's vice presidents, senior fab directors, and fab directors. We hope that this can help us reach a consensus of major issues and map out a  future roadmap to sustainability.  
Our Business Sustainable Governance Our Focuses and Progress 
Step 4: Analyze Impact on Operations 
114 Colleagues 
Taking into account the impact on the  economy, environment, and society, TSMC  identi ed the impact of each sustainability  issue through  ve operational aspects:  pro tability, revenue, customer  satisfaction, employee cohesion, and  risk. A total of 114 colleagues including  Chairman, senior vice presidents, vice  presidents, senior fab directors, and fab  directors participated in the investigation. 
Step 5: Map the Materiality Matrix 
According to the results from step 3    4, we have mapped out the materiality  matrix for TSMC. The CSR Committee  have discussed and agreed on the  results, identifying 13 material issues  and three potential issues. 
Step 6: Decide Disclosure Boundaries 
Procurement, wafer fabrication,  packaging testing, and customer use  are the four major stages of TSMC's value  chain, which determine sustainability  disclosure boundaries to help identify the  impact of such issues on our upstream  and downstream stages. 
The CSR Committee was able to identify 13 sustainability issues as material based on analysis  from the materiality matrix with three remaining issues identi ed as potential subjects that require  attention. Based on these sustainability issues, we have established a long-term target, strategy,  and action plan for 2030. We are also assessing each issues' impact on TSMC's value chain including  supply chain, company operations, and customers. In pursuant to GRI Standards, we have also  identi ed 20 material topics speci c to TSMC. Based on reporting requirements, we have collected  company information, data, and management approach to be disclosed in the 2019 CSR Report that  will serve as motivation for continued improvement. Compared to assessment results in the last year,  there was improvement in Water Management and Occupational Safety and Health. Management  contributed the improvement to the growing importance of these two issues on company  operations which led to adjustments to the materiality matrix and resulting in it becoming a focus of  sustainability within the company. 
Phase 3: Con rmation 
2019 Corporate Social Responsibility  Report 
Step 7: Review Disclosed Content 
We have aligned the 13 major issues with  the 20 speci c topics in the GRI Standards  to collect and disclose relevant information  based on the reporting requirements and  management approach dictated by GRI.  Other sustainability issues deemed signi cant  by the CSR Committee were disclosed at the  same time.

Seven  Sustainable  Management  Competencies 
Four Core  Elements 
Promoting corporate sustainability has been TSMC s commitment since the Company was established. As the Company continues to grow, we ve  established a clear mechanism for sustainable management through our e orts into the six main capitals, four core elements, and seven sustainable  management competencies. In order to consistently create value for our stakeholders, we have also established concrete, measurable long-term goals as  well as corresponding action plans that we can continue to review and correct. We are also taking advantage of our role as an industry leader, hoping that  we can extend our operational beliefs to each stages of our value chain. We hope that all of the sustainable management competencies can indeed make  an impact on our industry and society to drive a sustainable management model that maximizes net positive impact and minimizes negative impact. 
Mid-level Management Involvement 
Mid-level managers are the driving force behind the Company's advocacy for sustainability, conducting inter-organizational  and inter-departmental cooperation in the face of complex  sustainability issues in order to bring about material changes 
Organization Culture

Common good is TSMC s vision for ful lling corporate  
sustainability. We ve integrated concepts of Pro t and  
Loss (P L) with sustainable management to establish a  
Strategy Map by focusing on causal relationship, using an  
outside-in perspective to measure the social impact of  
TSMC s value chain. For  Customer Use , we ve leveraged  
the latest process technologies to help our customers  
enable their innovations and improve energy e ciency.  
We hope to promote health, safety and convenience  
with technology while helping to build a low-carbon  
society. For  Upstream Procurement , we are taking  
advantage of our role as an industry leader in the global  
semiconductor industry to improve the technologies and  
competency of local suppliers, and propel development  
and production value for the semiconductor industry  
chain. In the face of environmental issues within the  
supply chain, we also advocate for a responsible supply  
chain that can reduce its impact on the environment and  
society. In  TSMC Operations , we work on renewable  
energy, green manufacturing, reclaimed water sources,  
and the circular economy based on innovations. In doing  
so, we hope that we are able to reduce the costs and  
impact of resource consumption on the society. 
Meanwhile, TSMC is working with a team from the  
Corporate Sustainability and Social Responsibility  
Center of the Tunghai University. Since 2018 we have  
introduced an assessment for Environmental Pro t  
  Loss (EP L) which puts a monetary value on the  
social costs incurred throughout the global production  
process. The introduction of EP L allows us to consider  
our environmental footprint and its external costs  
throughout our decision-making process. In 2019, we  
further expanded our EP L analysis towards upstream  
procurement, hoping that we are able to discover more  
opportunities to reduce environmental footprint and  
increase social welfare, creating a more sustainable

Sustainability Impact  Strategy Map 
From purchasing and production to  
customer usage, TSMC has outlined a  
strategy map for the value chain derived  
from the causal relationship between of  
these interconnected lines for inspecting  
our various actions comprehensively.  
A monetary value is embraced as a  
sustainable management tool to measure  
the potential external costs (-) and values  
( ) that TSMC generates on the economy,  
environment, and society. 
Note 1: The  Strategy Map  is derived from the  Balanced Scorecard, a performance  management tool researched and  developed by Robert S. Kaplan and  David P. Norton in the late 1990s. The  Balanced Scorecard connects goals  with driving factors to serve as a tool for  management Note 2: The  TSMC Sustainability Impact  Strategy Map  employs concepts of  performance management to connect  predicted results in value chain activities  with causality among driving factors.  We then apply the concept of P L to  identify positive or negative impacts to  the economy, environment, and society.  Such positive or negative impacts  include direct or indirect economic value  as well as the external costs or bene ts  brought onto the natural environment or  society

Our Business Sustainable Governance Our Focuses and Progress 
Integrity is TSMC s most significant core value. The  
Company exercises self-discipline by complying  
with the highest ethical standards and substantially  
implements integrity, equality, and transparency  
in daily operations. TSMC holds zero tolerance  
for corrupt practices and strictly prohibits any  
behavior of bribery, fraud, blackmail, misuse,  
misappropriation of the Company s assets, or  
impairment of the Company s interest for personal  
gain. TSMC s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct  
(the Ethics Code) is the guideline for implementing  
the aforementioned core values. Every employee  
is required to shoulder the weighty responsibilities  
of both maintaining high ethical standards and the  
Company s reputation.  
In view of the importance of compliance with the  
Ethics Code, the Company s management team  
periodically reports to the Board and the Audit  
Committee on ethics and regulatory compliance.  
TSMC formed an Ethics Committee, which  
oversees implementation of the Ethics Code as  
well as the investigation and disciplinary action  
of reported incidents. Meanwhile, TSMC enhances  
suppliers  understanding and compliance with  
the Company s Ethics Code through the  Supplier  
Code of Conduct  and the  TSMC s Anti-Corruption  
Commitment , bringing the core value of integrity  
into supply chains and demonstrating it in  
business behavior. 
Reinforce Both Internally  and Externally 
Regulatory Identi cation and Policy  Formulation 
By periodically tracking regulatory changes, TSMC  
identifies potential risks and impacts arising from  
regulatory changes. According to the results of  
regulatory identification, TSMC assesses whether  
internal regulations align with the changes to  
ensure that relevant policies and regulations  
are applicable and appropriate. In 2019, TSMC  
updated our privacy policy and cookies policy  
on our website and privacy notices to TSMC  
employees in alignment with the latest practices  
under the EU General Data Protection Regulation  
and related risk assessments. 
Implementation and Execution 
Implementing laws and relevant internal  
regulations is an important part of TSMC s ethics  
and regulatory compliance. All organizations,  
subsidiaries and employees are required to  
ensure their business operations are compliant  
with laws, Company policies, and regulations.  
Through an annual Control Self-Assessment (CSA),  
all employees examine their own compliance  
performance and are open for audit by the Internal  
Audit organization. 
Training and Promotion 
To raise employee awareness of ethics and  
regulatory compliance, TSMC provided various  
training courses for all employees with relevant  
job responsibilities based on laws and relevant  
internal regulations. The training courses  
included face-to-face courses and promotions as  
well as mandatory and elective online courses.  
Through posters around our facilities, guidelines  
and FAQs of regulation compliance on the  
Company s intranet, internal email distributions,  
and promotional articles, TSMC ensures that all  
employees have timely access to new information  
of regulations and have a deeply-ingrained  
awareness of various issues.

examine the products and detect  ne cracks that were considered the main cause of vacuum abnormalities.  
Immediately conducted the comprehensive testing and completely ceased production for the model. 
Through cause analysis and testing, the Advanced Packaging Operations Division con rmed that the array of  
equipment ejector pins is in the same direction as the lattice in silicon wafers so that the residual stress caused  
cracks in products. The best con guration of ejector pins was found through stress simulation. Continuous

goals of increasing the productivity of outgoing visual  
inspectors for back-end packaging by 5% each year. 
In 2019, a batch of photo-resistor provided by a  
chemical supplier contained di erent materials that  
consequently caused heteropolymers in the liquid  
photo-resistor and had a negative e ect in the 12nm  
and 16nm wafers produced by TSMC Fab 14B. In  
order to guarantee wafer quality, TSMC immediately  
scrapped the defective wafers, informed all impacted  
customers, proposed alternative plans through  
individual communication, and strengthened online  
wafer testing to enforce stronger controls on incoming  
materials. In addition, TSMC increased capabilities  
of testing incoming materials provided by suppliers  
and enforced a certi cation procedure before using  
the materials in production in order to ensure that  
the quality is in accordance with requirements of the  
advanced process technology. 
In 2019, TSMC, in collaboration with SEMI, invited  
SEMICON, which had only been held in the U.S. and  
Europe, to hold the forum in Taiwan for the  rst time in  
2019 Corporate Social Responsibility  Report 
order to increase the competitiveness of Taiwan local  
supply chain in the global semiconductor industry. 55  
suppliers and 147 industry representatives participated  
in the event. TSMC also shared its innovations and  
management regarding the analysis of CMR substances  
as the Company has been dedicated to helping the  
global semiconductor industry produce higher- 
quality green products and realizing the goal of global  
sustainable management. 
Regarding the chemical management in manufacturing  
process, TSMC considers the comprehensive  
management of hazardous substances an important  
step in improving quality capability. The replacement  
plan of PFOA-related substances continued in 2019.  
Photo-resistor, the chemical that contains PFOA, is  
a key material in the manufacturing process. TSMC  
has tested a new, PFOA-free photo-resistor multiple  
times but problems with product yield means that  
formula and processing parameters must be adjusted  
and therefore delaying the substitution project. By  
May 2020, the completion rate has reached 86%. It  
is expected to reach 100% by the end of 2020. As for  
short-chain PFASs with 4 carbons, which has received  
worldwide attention, TSMC started an investigating  
evaluating substitution project regarding existing

chemicals in 2019 and also conducted evaluations of  
excluding such substances in the R D phase. 
In addition, TSMC has initiated a replacement project  
ahead of regulatory requirements regarding NMP,  
a commonly used chemical recognized as toxic for  
birth and reproduction. In 2019, the NMP substitution

Proprietary Information Protection 
Proprietary Information Protection is a promise from  
TSMC to customers, shareholders and employees. TSMC  
responds to the increasing importance of proprietary  
information protection in regard to maintaining  
current and future competitive advantage, and devises  
 Proprietary Information Protection   PIP  policy to  
de ne the proprietary information protection and  
management guidelines. TSMC trade secrets and related  
undisclosed con dential information are protected  
under these guidelines in the best interest of company,  
shareholders, employees, customers, and vendors.

TSMC s Strategy for Proprietary Information Protection 
TSMC considers the Proprietary Information Protection (PIP) as part of its core business  
strategy. To ful ll its commitment to PIP, the Company has adopted four approaches:  
information classi cation and control, access authorization, training programs, and  
compliance auditing. These measures serve to protect the proprietary information of  
not only TSMC and its subsidiaries but also any third party entity that conducts business  
dealings with TSMC. Furthermore, TSMC continues to enforce IT security measures,  
actively identifying potential vulnerabilities and risks for data breach, assessing possible  
damages, and developing mitigation measures to ful ll its commitment to Proprietary  
Information Protection. 
management. Consisting of Vice Presidents from legal  
counsels, Human Resource, R D, and Operations, the  
committee holds regular meetings to review and develop  
important policies on information protection and  
information security. It creates and enforces Proprietary  
Information Protection policy and guidelines, develops  
e ective compliance mechanism, continues to enhance  
its capability to protect proprietary information, and  
ensures the applicability of those regulations through  
yearly reviews. Amendments were made in 2019 to  
guidelines on proprietary information management  
and to physical security area de nition. Seven major  
approaches were adopted to consolidate and protect  
Company s proprietary information.

IT Security Management Measures in 2019 
TSMC has developed speci c methods for the  
assessment of information security risks, created clear  
protocols for management, built automated information  
security management system, and obtained ISO 27001  
certi cation for information security, thereby becoming  
compliant with international standards for information  
security management. In response to all kinds of cyber- 
attacks and external threats to information security,  
TSMC continued in 2019 to enforce information security  
risk management measures, enhance detection, and  
strengthen defensive measures. For example, TSMC has  
created automated anti-virus system to prevent malware

its employees how to identify phishing emails and provided  
clear guidelines to employees and contractors to avoid  
infractions of information security protocols. Furthermore,  
TSMC targets its e orts at employees by establishing internal  
PIP Working Committees in its organizations and functional  
units. In a total of 60 organizations, including TSMC s  
Taiwan facilities and overseas subsidiaries, PIP Guardians  
hold monthly meetings to keep track of situations on  
the ground, raise suggestions on information security for  
their organizations, and design PIP measures that meet  
the speci c needs of their organizations, keep pace with  
changing conditions, and adapt to local circumstances. In

all parties and guides the semiconductor supply  
chain to a virtuous cycle. 
Code Compliance 
The TSMC Supplier Code of Conduct is based on  
the Code of Conduct by Responsible Business  
Alliance (RBA). It requires suppliers to comply  
with the Code of Conduct while encouraging  
them to ask their upstream suppliers, contractors,  
and service providers to approve and adopt  
the same code in practices and management as  
well. New suppliers must sign the TSMC Supplier  
Code of Conduct to be eligible for partnership.  
This is to ensure that the suppliers understand  
TSMC s sustainability requirements, comply with

Violations, and TSMC experts, to identify the high- 
risk suppliers of the year. In 2019, TSMC identified  
109 high-risk suppliers across four categories,  
which are raw materials, spare parts, packaging  
testing, and waste processing. This way, TSMC  
effectively evaluates the sustainability risk of the  
entire supply chain. 
In 2019, Tier 1 suppliers in Taiwan, where the  
TSMC headquarters is located, completed  
908 Self-Assessment Questionnaires at the  
completion rate of 100%. The SAQ this year  
contains five major categories specified in

supplier risks. The SAQ results showed that  
compliance with the TSMC Supplier Code of  
Conduct by suppliers in Taiwan exceeded 96 on  
average. Among the items in the five categories,  
compliance with labor policies, especially work  
hours regulations, require the most improvement. 
TSMC is working with suppliers to mitigate  
climate change risks  we will continue to require  
suppliers with high energy consumption to  
conserve energy, reduce carbon emissions, and  
receive ISO14064-1 greenhouse gas certifications. 
Audit Participation and Continuous  Improvement 
Among Tier 1 suppliers, TSMC requires all  
critical suppliers to undergo third-party audits  
on sustainability risk by RBA-certified auditing  
institutions. Forty-six critical suppliers completed  
supplier audits in 2019, and TSMC expects all  
critical suppliers to complete third-party audit by  
2021, at the completion rate of 100%. The audit  
allows TSMC to evaluate actual risks and enhance  
the overall performance of the suppliers. For

Collaboration with Taiwan  Specialty Chemicals Corporation -  TSMC 2019 Outstanding Supplier  Award Winner for Breakthrough  in Quality 
Supply chain localization not only ensures source and quality stability for TSMC materials  working with local  raw materials suppliers allows TSMC to improve the production quality of critical raw materials, expand  capacity, reduce the carbon footprint for the supply chain, and strengthen supply chain sustainability. 
Localization Maximizes Production Bene t of Critical Raw Materials  
TSMC products require a specialty gas - Disilane (Si2H6). Due to the high purity and precision necessary for  semiconductor production, the technological barrier led TSMC to procure this gas from overseas suppliers.  In 2017, TSMC assembled an inter-departmental project team consisting of experts in supply chain material  management, quality and reliability, and facility services, to provide consultation for a local semiconductor  raw materials supplier, Taiwan Specialty Chemicals Corporation, on Disilane production. After multiple on-site  audits and technology exchanges, the Disilane produced by the Taiwan Specialty Chemicals Corporation now  meets advanced processes requirements from TSMC.   
In 2019, Taiwan Specialty Chemicals Corporation received a TSMC Outstanding Supplier Award, which is the  evidence of synchronized growth for both local suppliers and TSMC.

In 2019, the European Parliament declared a  
climate emergency in response to the frequent  
climate disasters around the world. TSMC effectively  
adapted to the potential impacts of climate  
disasters on business operations by strengthening  
climate-resilient designs for its facilities and  
reinforcing emergency response disaster drill  
plans. Furthermore, the Company purchased 910  
GWh of renewable energy and improved its energy  
management, investing additional resources to  
the development of energy-saving designs for  
production equipment. Through a series of relentless  
efforts, carbon emissions per unit of production  
continued to decrease, effectively mitigating  
greenhouse gas emissions. 
In 2019, TSMC reported steady decreases in carbon  
emissions per unit of production while it continued  
to expand production capacity and develop  
new technologies. As declared in the Corporate  
Social Responsibility Policy and Environmental  
Protection Policy, responding to climate change is  
the responsibility of sustainable business such as  
TSMC. Striving to become a world leader in green  
manufacturing is our mission. We believe that  
only through cooperation with business partners,  
industry, government, academia, and all of society  
can we work together to overcome the severe  
challenges of climate change. 
With the continuous advancement of process  
technology, integrated circuits are growing increasingly  
complex and therefore, the power required to  
manufacture them continues to grow. Even though  
in 2019 TSMC invested considerable resources into  
the development of renewable energy and green  
2019 Corporate Social Responsibility  Report 
tools, implemented 503 energy-saving measures, and  
introduced new energy-saving equipment, energy  
consumption per unit of production still did not reach  
the anticipated reduction goals. With a commitment to  
green manufacturing, TSMC will continue to purchase  
renewable energy and expand renewable energy power  
generation to increase the percentage of renewable  
energy in TSMC s energy structure, reduce greenhouse  
gas emissions from production activities, and achieve  
the goals of greenhouse gas reduction.

Renewable Energy Purchasing 
Starting in 2018, TSMC began to purchase renewable  
energy, RECs, and carbon credits in countries with  
comprehensive regulations and ample supply, aiming  
to completely 100% o set the carbon dioxide emissions  
from the power used in locations around the world such  
as the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and Japan.  
In 2019, TSMC s overseas sites have achieved the goal of  
zero carbon emissions from power consumption. 
In 2019, TSMC developed strategies to increase the  
purchasing of renewable energy in Taiwan. Around  
0.7GWh of renewable energy is currently under  
negotiation, which will be supplied to TSMC in the  
coming years. Since Taiwan s renewable energy  
development is still in its nascent phase, TSMC has

2019 Corporate Social Responsibility  Report 
set up a Renewable Energy Development Task Force  
through which it closely communicates with government  
through the Allied Association for Science Parks and the  
Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA) to  
provide constructive suggestions regarding renewable  
energy development. For example, TSMC has advised  
the government to expand o shore wind farms and  
increase the supply from renewable energy trading  
platforms. With the collaboration between the Ministry  
of Economic A airs, Taipower, Green energy companies  
and TSMC, renewable energy development in Taiwan  
has reached a key milestone. 90MW of renewable energy  
was o cially provided to TSMC in early May 2020,  
making TSMC one of the  rst companies in Taiwan to  
purchase retransmitted renewable energy.  
The highest governing body of TSMC the Board of  
Directors supports the UN SDGs of a ordable and  
clean energy and climate action, pays attention to  
renewable energy purchasing issues, and requires the  
Corporate Social Responsibility Executive Committee to  
regularly provide reports on renewable energy purchase  
strategies and progress. TSMC believes that close  
communication with the government and cooperation  
with renewable energy providers will accelerate the  
growth of Taiwan s renewable energy industry, which  
in turn increases the purchasing of renewable energy  
and reduces the environmental impact of power  
consumption.

In 2019, increases in advanced process development and  
process complexity led to increased power consumption  
in new process equipment, raising the power  
consumption per unit of 10nm and 7nm production  
to double that of  16-nm process technologies.  
Consequently, the overall power consumption per unit  
of production in 2019 increased by 17.9% compared  
to the base year and therefore did not achieve the  
default reduction target of 11.5%. For this reason,  
TSMC has increased its use of renewable energy each  
year and also extended its technological innovation to  
sustainable equipment designs. In 2019, the Company  
invested resources and collaborated with more suppliers  
to introduce complete energy-saving plans in the

Case Study 
Taking the Lead in Joining Forces with Suppliers to Develop World-class Semiconductor Green Tools 
As the world s largest dedicated IC foundry company, TSMC is committed to creating a  
sustainable semiconductor supply chain. Because the power consumption of process equipment  
accounts for more than 50% of the company s energy use, and the number of advanced process  
equipment is increasing every year, TSMC has collaborated with equipment suppliers since 2016 to  
develop green tools for semiconductor manufacturing. Before these new tools were introduced,  
TSMC completed energy-saving design veri cation, installed energy-saving components, and  
expanded the energy-saving e ects of advanced process equipment. 
TSMC is the  rst semiconductor company in the world to ask its equipment suppliers to  
introduce energy-saving measures. Based on the assessments of the Energy and Carbon  
Reduction Committee, in 2018 2019 TSMC invited seven semiconductor manufacturers and  
suppliers around the world to host hundreds of discussion forums and extensively analyze the  
energy consumption parameters of all advanced fab tools, subsequently leading to the launch  
of the Energy Conservation Action Project for Next-Generation Fab Tools. From energy-saving  
ideas, planning, simulation testing to product veri cation, this process is continuously repeated,  
and energy-saving speci cations are incorporated into new fab tool procurement standards,  
demonstrating TSMC s commitment to saving energy. TSMC expects that energy savings will be  
achieved to 20% by 2030 to drive the positive cycle of the industry and supply chain. 
Thanks to the relentless e orts of more than 300 TSMC employees, 250 energy saving action  
plans were proposed in 2019, of which 110 plans were approved, veri ed, and applied to 54  
types of 5-nm advanced process tools. High-e ciency parts and energy saving designs have  
been incorporated into 11 types of energy-intensive components. TSMC expects that 200 GWh of  
electricity will be saved in 2020 due to the use of 5-nm energy-saving fab tools. In addition, the  
Company developed the  green tools certi cation system  in 2019, and completed the green  
certi cation of 27 types of fab tools for four equipment suppliers.

Semiconductor processes have become complex  
as they advance from 2D structures to a 3D FinFET  
architecture, which in turn increases the types  
and quantity of the chemical materials used.  
Water is vital to cleaning wafers and maintaining  
a clean environment. TSMC has established  
various water recycling applications through  
water resource risk management, expansion of  
diverse water sources, and the development  
of pollution prevention techniques in order to  
maximize the efficiency water use throughout  
the water cycle in its facilities. In 2019, the  
Company took further steps to regulate the  
water management framework of its facilities to  
ensure the reasonable allocation of facility water  
resources in response to seasonal temperature  
TSMC uses a comprehensive water reporting system for  
continuous monitoring of water levels in water reservoirs,  
and installs hundreds of water consumption monitoring  
points combined with water balance diagrams around its  
facilities to calculate process water consumption, recycled  
water, wastewater, and domestic water consumption in  
facilities, as well as to track the direction and quantity  
of water  ow and water reclamation status. The data is  
used as the basis for calculating water recycling rates  
and water discharged rates, for estimating the volume of

establishing an e ective index for monitoring water use. 
Smart Management of Recycled Water 
The key to successful water resources allocation is  
detailed classi cation and comprehensive water  
reclamation mechanisms. TSMC categorizes wastewater  
from puri cation and processing equipment according  
to purity so that the cleanest water is given priority to  
be puri ed and recycled for use in the manufacturing  
process, and the second cleanest water is treated in

predictions, TSMC re ned water reclamation techniques  
such as reverse osmosis membranes, resin columns,  
and UV lights to improve the quality of recycled water.  
Recycled water with improved quality can replace city  
water. For example, when the use of air-conditioning  
systems is reduced in winter, cooling towers require  
less water, causing an excess of recycled water. A smart  
recycled water management mechanism can dynamically  
allocate and supply recycled water, instead of city water,

First Semiconductor Company to Receive Platinum Certi cation from the  Alliance for Water Stewardship with the Highest Rating in History 
To mitigate climate change, implement green manufacturing, and continue to  
improve water e ciency, TSMC has introduced the world s only AWS Standard  
in 2019, using Fab 6 and Fab 14 Phases 5 6 7 as the initial demonstration site.  
In December of the same year, TSMC was o cially certi ed by AWS, becoming  
the world s  rst semiconductor company to receive AWS certi cation. TSMC s  
evaluation score of 114 points not only surpasses the Platinum-level threshold (80  
points) but it is also the highest score on record. 
TSMC is committed to managing its water resources in an e ort to ful ll the sixth  
UN Sustainable Development Goal Clean Water and Sanitation  and to be  
the  rst in the industry to comply with AWS standards. TSMC has established a  
comprehensive and systematic sustainable water management organization.  
The AWS team that came to inspect the entire catchment in the certi cation  
process has recognized and praised TSMC for implementing the industry-leading  
copper extraction from waste copper sulfate program, creating a high-tech green  
factory with  re y habitat restoration, planning the recycling and reuse of general  
wastewater in the site, and working with external units to create green energy  
smart water control gates that help improve e ciency in domestic irrigation. 
In 2019, the AWS Task Force summarized their experiences with a demonstration  
site in the AWS Blue Book. The Blue Book serves as a guideline for promoting Fab  
matching, and Fab 15 is expected to complete certi cation in 2020, in hopes that  
the company s operations can co-exist and prosper with the environment.

Case Study 
First Company to Recover Fire ies On-site 
Dedicated to ful lling our mission to strengthen environmental protection, we have adopted biodiversity  
conservation management and are the  rst business in Taiwan to successfully recover  re ies in our fab  
sites (For more detail, please go to  Successful Recovery of Fire ies in TSMC s Tainan Fab ). After four years of  
unremitting e orts, as of April, 2019, over 200  re ies have been spotted in our Tainan Fab. The  re y habitat  
experience is now being replicated in our Hsinchu and Taichung fabs. 
Establishment of the Best Habitat Building Process 
To ensure that the  re ies are breeding steadily, in 2019, we placed more focus on managing water quality  
and vegetation cover. We also monitored the quantity and growth of snail prey so that Aquatica  cta larvae,  
which feed on snails, are able to enter the pupal stage. Moreover, we have always maintained our  re y  
habitats with minimal interference. Apart from simulating their natural habitat, we took further measures  
such as installing shorter street lights and LED 590nm  re y lamps to reduce light pollution and habitat  
disturbance. 
A Larger Fire ies Habitat to Light up TSMC Fabs 
Seeking to set up an eco-friendly fab, we collaborated with ecologists to select potential locations for  re y  
habitats in September 2019. In the future, we will be recovering three species on three newly-selected sites  
according to the respective environment, and gradually build up a habitat for the  re ies. With each step we  
take, TSMC is becoming greener, and one step closer to reaching a balance between technology and ecology.

Source  Management 
TSMC s waste management strategies are primarily  
focused on source reduction. TSMC continuously  
minimizes resource consumption at the source,  
adjusts raw material usage parameters and  
technical solutions for process improvements, and  
collaborates with suppliers to achieve material  
optimization and minimization. After raw materials  
are used in production processes, on-site recycling  
is prioritized so that resources are sufficiently reused  
to delay the disposal of materials as waste.

Waste Resources 
TSMC has been implementing the concept of a  
circular economy to manage waste resources. First,  
waste resources are made into products by using  
facility resource renewal equipment. These products  
are provided for use in facilities or sold to other  
industries for use. For non-reusable resources that  
cannot be converted through resource renewal  
technology or reused, TSMC prioritizes recycling and  
recovery by sending them to certified waste disposal  
vendors. When all options have been exhausted,  
TSMC s final option is to dispose of waste by  
incineration and landfill. In 2019, the recycling rate

In addition, TSMC has built a real-time management system  
to track the amount of waste produced per unit in the  
production process. In addition to examining e ectiveness  
on a monthly basis and eliminating abnormalities, fab  
managers can monitor the output of waste in real time and  
compare outputs with other fabs to identify opportunities for  
waste reduction. In 2019, through 247 new source reduction  
and resource reuse plans, TSMC reduced the amount  
of waste per wafer by 274,348 tons over the whole year.  
However, new production processes are di cult to develop,  
initial operating systems have not yet been optimized,  
and the operating processes of in-house resource renewal  
equipment still need to be improved. Therefore, the reuse  
rate of resources was only 22%, and outsourced unit waste  
disposal per wafer was 0.4 kg in 2019, indicating a failure to  
achieve the original goals. In 2020, TSMC will continue to  
implement various reduction plans for newly-constructed  
facilities and further increase the reuse rate of resources to  
meet the goal of achieving 0.39 kg per wafer equivalent of  
outsourced waste disposal.

Minor Alterations Create Major Waste Reductions  in IPA 
TSMC capitalizes on its Waste Management  
Task Force and unit waste output management  
system to control its waste output and ful ll its  
commitment to source reduction. In 2019, TSMC  
identi ed a gradual increase in the output of  
IPA liquid waste from advanced manufacturing  
processes. An analysis of this liquid waste revealed  
a low concentration of IPA waste from advanced  
processes, and that the high water content was  
attributed to an increase in IPA waste output.  
Further inspection of 45 machines that produce  
IPA waste shows that IPA vapor easily adheres  
to pipeline walls, causing wafer surface defects.  
Advanced process wafer-cleaning machines were  
incorporated with a new design that uses deionized  
water to remove residual IPA, resulting in increased  
water content in IPA liquid waste and a dramatic  
increase in waste output. For this reason, TSMC  
immediately carried out an IPA waste reduction  
project and discussed improvement methods  
with equipment vendors. Water volume control  
valves were installed in wafer cleaning machines  
for advanced processes, and experimental designs  
were adopted to reduce water volume by 87%. This  
approach not only meets the quality requirements  
of advanced processes but also successfully  
reduced low-concentration IPA waste by 9,720  
metric tons per year.

In addition to source reduction, TSMC is also taking  
actions to respond to the call for circular economy. To  
increase the feasibility of waste recycling, TSMC has  
reviewed the use of each chemical and classi ed the  
ultimate  ows of chemicals inside the facilities. 38 types  
of liquid waste were distributed using a comprehensive  
plan and remade into 30 types of recycled products for  
circular use in other industries. To strengthen product

Timeline for the  Waste to Valuce  Action Plan 
Reuse of facility resources is key to promoting the  
circular economy in TSMC. To improve the quality of  
ammonium sulfate treatment in line with the highest  
speci cation requirements in the industry, TSMC  
suspended its ammonium sulfate waste crystallization  
system in 2019 and engaged in a series of system  
modi cations and process optimizations, in hopes  
of identifying the optimal operating process with  
maximum e ciency. Consequently, the company s  
production capacity based on in-house resource  
reuse rates did not achieve the original goal for 2019.

Case Study 
Successful Implementation of the Circular Economy  Three-Zero  Project 
With the expansion of production capacity, TSMC has expanded its circular economy actions to avoid the environmental  
burden caused by the corresponding increase in waste output. Concurrently, the Company has amended its Articles of  
Incorporation and introduced 4 additional business items, including chemical materials, to increase opportunities for recycling  
resources. TSMC s green manufacturing team in Facility Division constantly studies and evaluates the feasibility, operational  
safety, and economic bene ts of various resource renewal technologies. In 2019, the  three-zero  project was successfully  
implemented, subsequently achieving the  three-zero  goals: zero outsourcing treatment of cobalt-containing liquid waste,  
zero outsourcing treatment of copper-containing liquid waste, and zero purchase of industrial-grade sulfuric acid. 
Zero Copper-Containing Liquid Waste  Outsourced 
Since 2016, TSMC has actively developed copper-containing  
liquid waste electroplating recycling systems and continued  
to extract copper from waste copper sulfate to directly convert  
copper-containing liquid waste into recycled copper tubes  
onsite in the facilities. In 2017, TSMC subsequently cooperated  
with raw material suppliers to research and develop  
puri cation procedures that remake pure reclaimed copper  
tubes into electronics-grade copper anodes. As of 2018, the  
Company began extending this recycling process to TSMC s  
manufacturing processes and succeeded in establishing a  
reclamation model for electronic-grade copper materials. In  
2019, TSMC realized the goal of zero outsourcing treatment  
of copper-containing liquid waste in its mass-production  
facilities and recovered a total of 15,654 metric tons of copper- 
containing liquid waste, reclaiming 167 tons of recycled copper  
tubes and creating an annual bene t of over NT 100 million  
from recycling and waste reduction.

Zero Cobalt-Containing Liquid Waste  Outsourced 
The development of semiconductor advanced manufacturing  
processes has resulted in the widespread use of cobalt as a  
conductive material. However, for this rare metal, there are  
no cobalt-containing liquid waste recovery technologies and  
treatment vendors in the market. Therefore, tapping into its  
successful experience with copper extraction systems, TSMC  
has installed in-house electroplating systems to completely  
recover cobalt-containing liquid waste and remake them  
into pure cobalt products. In addition to achieving zero  
outsourcing treatment of cobalt-containing liquid waste  
in its mass-productionfabs, TSMC has also produced pure  
cobalt products that can be reused in the battery and catalyst  
industries. In 2019, TSMC reduced a total of 277 tons of cobalt- 
containing liquid waste, which were originally treated by  
outsourced vendors, and generated roughly 180 kg of pure  
cobalt products, creating an annual bene t of over NT 10  
million from recycling and waste reduction.

Adhering to the principle of  Minimizing Waste and Maximizing  
Resources,  TSMC changed its traditional waste treatment  
approach in 2015 and successfully introduced a waste sulfuric  
acid recycling system that enables waste sulfuric acid from  
semiconductor manufacturing processes to be reused as additives  
for wastewater systems. In 2019, TSMC continued to hone its green  
innovation capability, e ectively improve the production capacity  
and quality of reclaimed sulfuric acid, and achieved cross-fab  
recycling of reclaimed sulfuric acid, exempting the company from  
purchasing 50% industrial sulfuric acid. In total, TSMC recycled  
96,081 metric tons of waste sulfuric acid, creating an annual bene t  
of over NT 200 million from recycling and waste reduction.

zeolite rotor concentrators to  rst concentrate volatile  
organic gases, burns them in thermal oxidizer, then merge  
with the clean gases after adsorption, before  nally  
emitted into the atmosphere. After processing by the  
zeolite rotor concentrators, the reduction rate of organic  
waste gases can reach 95%, which exceeds the regulatory  
requirement of 90%. In 2019, parameter optimization of  
zeolite rotor concentrators was introduced, and zeolite  
rotor concentrators for facilities whose reduction rate was  
lower than 95% were replaced, thus e ectively improving  
the reduction rate to 97% or higher. Newly-built facilities  
(plants built after Fab 15 Phase 7) adopted dual zeolite  
rotor concentrators, which can achieve a 99.5% reduction  
rate of volatile organic gases. TSMC s average reduction  
rate of organic waste gas emissions has surpassed  
Unit: metric ton 
95% for  ve consecutive years since 2015. Due to the  
continuous increase in prevention e ciency, the total  
emission of volatile organic gases did not increase with  
new fabs coming into production. 
Through continuous improvements in acidic, caustic,  
and organic gases, TSMC s air pollution emission per unit  
of production in 2019 was 0.28 (grams 8-inch equivalent  
wafer mask layer), compared to the 0.4 in base year  
of 2015 (grams 8-inch equivalent wafer mask layer),  
representing a decrease of 30.3%, achieving the 2025

TSMC actively strengthens the capacity of its pollution  
prevention facilities and relevant monitoring and backup  
systems. The capacity of related prevention facilities in  
overseas subsidiaries complies with not only Taiwanese  
regulations, but also local regulatory standards. To  
guarantee stable and optimal operating conditions all day  
and year round, and to ensure that all colleagues gain  rst- 
hand information on the operating parameters of prevention  
facilities and are aware of the reduction rate and pollutant  
emission situations, all prevention facilities are equipped  
with N 1 backup systems and real-time monitoring systems  
in order to ensure that prevention facilities can immediately  
switch to backup systems if any abnormalities occur, and are  
protected by an uninterrupted power supply system to reach  
the management goal of zero facility failures. 
Facility Monitor Control Center Industrial Safety Emergency Response Center 
Strengthen Monitoring of  Prevention Facilities 
An air pollution prevention equipment operation status  
platform was established in 2019 to ensure immediate  
emergency response in the event of monitoring  
equipment failure. Furthermore, the Facilities Division  
and industrial Safety and Environmental Protection  
Department are able to submit online queries on the  
operation status and maintenance status of air pollution  
prevention facilities and keep apprised of whether  
relevant operation parameters match the facility s  
optimal values. Combined with the original abnormality  
reporting system, relevant monitoring results can be  
reported to the facility monitor control center and the  
industrial safety emergency response center. Thus,  
the dual-track independent monitoring system more  
comprehensively ensures that the gas emitted from  
stacks are in compliance with regulations. With the  
protection of an early warning system and real-time  
responses, no abnormal occurrences were reported to  
supervising authorities in 2019. 
Case Study 
Zeolite Rotor Concentrators Designed with Dual Rotors Achieve 99.5%  Annual Reduction Rate of Volatile Organic Gas Emissions 
TSMC utilizes zeolite rotor concentrators and thermal oxidizer to deal with the emission of volatile organic gases, and  
the removal rate can reach 95 97%, which exceeds than the 90% required by the  Air Pollution Control and Emissions  
Standards for the Semiconductor Industry . In particular, the volatile organic emissions make up the largest proportion  
of air pollutants. In an e ort to achieve environmental sustainability, TSMC continues to employ new technologies to  
improve the e ectiveness of central prevention facilities. 
The zeolite rotor designs for volatile organic gases emitted by TSMC facilities feature single rotors. To continuously  
improve the reduction rate of zeolite rotors and reduce the emission of VOCs, TSMC has introduced dual zeolite rotor  
concentrators to the new Fab 15 Phase 7 facility in 2019. The rotor substrate adopts a new zeolite with wet-impregnation  
method, which can reduce rotor pressure drop by roughly 10% and enhance adsorption performance. At the same time,  
due to lower thermal capacity, the concentration factor can be increased from 15 times to 20 times or more, e ectively

reducing energy consumed during operation. Dual rotors treat waste gas by transferring high-concentration process  
waste gas (60 120 ppm) from the  rst rotor adsorption process to the thermal oxidizer for combustion. Subsequently,  
the low-concentration waste gas (2 5 ppm), which was originally emitted, is concentrated in the second rotor and  
transferred back to the  rst rotor for repeated processing. Finally, the clean air (0.5 1.5 ppm) treated in the second rotor  
is emitted through the exhaust stacks. 
Following the dual adsorption treatment of the dual rotor, the reduction rate of volatile organic gases was increased  
signi cantly to 99.5%, demonstrating an e ective reduction of volatile organic gas emissions. In 2019, TSMC successfully  
adopted clean-gas-desorbing zeolite rotor concentrators in its existing facilities, and simultaneously introduced  
parameter optimization of zeolite rotor concentrators to ensure that the total emission of volatile organic gases in 2019  
was una ected by facility expansion, actively working to realize the corporate mission of green manufacturing.

All employees at TSMC are treated equally regardless  
of their gender, religion, race, nationality, or  
political a liation. Due to the characteristics of  
the semiconductor industry and Taiwan s cultural  
environment, over 60% of our employees are male.  
Going into more speci c details, over 80% of our  
managers, professionals, and assistants are male,  
and over 80% of technicians on the production lines  
are female. As TSMC s fabs become increasingly  
automated, there is a declining need for production  
line operators, a group consisting mainly of female  
employees, which is leading to a gradual drop in the  
total percentage of female employees at TSMC. 
Despite the decline in the percentage of female  
employees in recent years, TSMC s female employees  
enjoy a similar promotion ratio with their male  
counterparts, at 0.97:1, an achievement facilitated by  
TSMC s proactive e orts in recruitment and retention.  
Female section managers or above are generally  
promoted more than their male counterparts at a  
ratio of 1.14:1. In addition, at TSMC, male and female  
employees enjoy the same compensation system,  
which does not discriminate based on gender. 
In 2020, TSMC will continue to support its female  
employees by adopting all possible measures to retain  
as many female employees as possible, and provide  
them with the opportunity to live up to their full  
potential and to make valuable contributions to TSMC  
and society.

Case Study 
2019 Large-scale Hiring Plan Attracts a Considerable  Amount of Talent to Seize TSMC s Quality Job O ers 
In July of 2019, TSMC fabs in Taiwan began mass recruitment for new positions in response to business growth,  
technology development, and advanced fab expansion. By the end of the year, approximately 3,500 people were  
recruited, including fresh graduates and experienced professionals. In comparison with recent years, 3,500 new  
hires is almost equivalent to the number of people recruited throughout the entire year. To achieve its recruitment  
goal, TSMC not only held interviews and recruitment events on weekdays but also organized six large scale job fairs  
on weekends in its Hsinchu, Taichung, and Tainan sites, allowing experienced job seekers to attend interviews at  
convenient time and locations. Furthermore, special bonus was provided as incentives to encourage newcomers  
to come onboard as early as possible.  
TSMC considers its employees as its most important assets. As it is known that TSMC not only provides challenging  
job and diversi ed career path, but also o ers employees highly competitive compensation packages and  
bene ts, the Company is able to attract talent with shared value in a timely manner. 
During large-scale recruitment period, TSMC  rmly adhered to its principle of  Putting right people with shared  
visions and values in right position,  and assess candidates by selection criteria and interview. At the same time,  
TSMC provides orientation, training programs, buddy program and more to help newcomers to adapt to work  
environment and role faster. These practices encourage employees to stay with TSMC to push the envelope of

From the questions asked by HR and hiring managers, I felt respect. They  started by asking questions related to my character, past experience,  my mindset, and how I deal with things, instead of throwing me difficult  questions that made me feel incompetent.

However, due to the nature of available job vacancies,  
VisEra received a dearth of suitable applicants, leading

To help employees plan on their career paths, TSMC is  
dedicated to enhancing the transparency of internal job

Salary Raise 
 In order to maintain the competitiveness of our compensation, TSMC appropriately adjusts  employees' salaries annually, taking into consideration of the results of global salary  surveys, market salary scales, and economic indices. 
 In April 2019, TSMC conducted salary raises for employees in Taiwan and overseas  subsidiaries. The salary increase rate was 3%-5% for employees in Taiwan, 7% - 8% for  employees in China, and 3% - 5% for employees in other regions. 
 In addition to the salary raise mentioned above, VisEra, due to the di erent nature of the  industry it belongs to and the need to attract valuable talents, raised the starting salary  for newly recruited employees with no prior work experience in 2019. To ensure that its  compensation remains competitive in the labor market, the company also announced a  structural salary raise in average 3% for existing employees. 
 The employee incentive programs take into consideration of TSMC's  nancial and operational  performance, future development and the operational performance of each subsidiaries,with  linkage to employee's job responsibilities and performance. The programs are implemented  with short-term and long-term incentive schemes according to local industry practices. 
 The incentive program of TSMC fabs in Taiwan is implemented over a period of two years. Cash  bonuses are paid quarterly to provide timely incentive, and pro t sharing is paid annually to  encourage long-term service and continuous contribution. The incentive programs of overseas  regions are either by annual cash bonus or by 1 to 3 years of longterm scheme. 
 In 2019, TSMC employees' compensation and bene ts which include salary, allowances, cash  bonus, pro t sharing, pensions and other bene ts, totaled NT 109.9 billion. 
 In 2019, the median of global employees' annual compensation (excluding pensions and  bene ts) was about NT 1.63 million, and the ratio between the total annual compensation of  the CEO and the median employee compensation was about 180:1. Considering the di erences  in compensation structure across countries, the data of median annual compensation is based  on the actual amount paid to fulltime employees with full-year seniority. 
With the continuous growth of the Company s revenue  
and pro t, the expenses of overall compensation and  
bene ts for employees provided by TSMC fabs in Taiwan  
increased from around NT 91.6 billion to NT 109.9 billion  
during the years from 2015 to 2019, and the average  
annual compensation and bene ts per employee  
increased from NT 2.02 million to NT 2.14 million. 
TSMC s revenue increased and pro t decreased sligtly in  
2019. As a result, around NT 46.3 billion of cash bonuses  
and pro t sharing were granted to TSMC fabs in Taiwan,  
slightly lower than 2018. The total compensation of a fresh  
engineer with a master degree is about 31 months of base  
salary, including 12-month base salary, 2-month year-end  
bonus, as well as approximately 17 months of cash bonuses  
and pro t sharing. The average total compensation of

bene ts that are better than the statutory requirements  
and regulations, including holidays, insurance, pensions,  
 nancial assistance for emergencies, subsidies for  
marriage  childbirth  funerals, and discounts in designated  
shops. Furthermore, all TSMC facilities are equipped with  
24-hour health centers, where healthcare management  
professionals and appointed on-site physicians provide  
quality services beyond those required by legal statutes.  
The centers work closely with partners such as hospitals  
and Hsinchu Lifeline to o er comprehensive care for  
employees  physical and mental well-being.  
TSMC values the well-being of its employees. The company  
encourages employees to exercise regularly by subsidizing 67  
sports clubs, improving exercise facilities, and holding regular  
sports events to help employees  nd peers with similar  
sports interests for balance between work and life. In 2019,  
TSMC was granted the Exercise Enterprise Certi cation Award  
by Sports Administration of the Ministry of Education.  
TSMC is home to a number of vibrant sports clubs that  
consistently perform well in the Science Park Games,  
including tennis club, badminton club, basketball club,  
softball club, and volleyball club. As part of their e orts to

To provide su cient support in their life and work, TSMC  
o ers employees parental leaves in accordance with local  
laws and regulations, sets up four kindergartens for fabs in  
Taiwan, and provides a well-organized leave management  
system. Employees have  exibility in making use of their  
leaves to take care of their children. When facing military  
service or major injuries which require a long period of  
time to heal, employees also can apply for unpaid leaves,  
and then apply for reinstatement after the expiration of the  
period, to ful l both individual and family needs. 
In 2019, a total of 582 employees in TSMC s Taiwan  
facilities and VisEra applied for unpaid parental leaves,  
Note: Data included Taiwan facilities and VisEra

and a total of 505 employees were scheduled to return  
from unpaid parental leaves, of which 398 employees  
returned either as scheduled or ahead of schedule,  
leading to a return rate of 78.8%. The retention rate,  
on the other hand, was 77.9%, since 345 out of 443  
employees who resumed duty in 2018 were still in service  
by the end of 2019. Such a high retention rate shows  
that TSMC provides e ective support for employees who  
return from unpaid leaves. 
In addition, the number of TSMC employees aged  
between 20 and 64 in Taiwan in 2019 accounted for  
0.29% of Taiwan s population of the same age group.  
Meanwhile, the number of employees  newborns was  
2,531, which was 1.4% of the total number of newborns

In 2019, TSMC formulated its 2030 Goal for Inclusive  
Workplace: Talent Development to ensure that  
employees   skillsets remain relevant, to support the  
company s long-term growth, and to promote life- 
long learning among employees. In the next decade,  
TSMC will enhance on-the-job training, o er diversi ed  
learning resources, and build comprehensive self- 
learning programs to promote self-learning among  
employees, enhance the learning agility of organizations,  
and help employees grow. To these ends, TSMC has  
formulated two major strategies: encouraging job  
rotation and promoting self-learning. In addition to  
increasing the percentage of job vacancies  lled through  
internal transfers, the Company has also set a target  
for the percentage of manager vacancies  lled through  
internal promotions. Furthermore, since self-learning  
has accounted for more than 50% of learning programs,  
the Company has entered the next phase of self-learning  
advocacy by encouraging employees to take non- 
required online learning courses. 
Encouraging job rotations and promoting self-directed  
learning are important strategies for talent development  
at TSMC. In terms of encouraging job rotations, TSMC  
has proactively implemented on-the-job training and  
certi cation systems, allowing employees to learn and  
improve their work performance in the workplace. The  
Company not only systematically designs job rotation  
programs to cultivate future talent, but also encourages  
its employees to complement their career plans with  
the Company s organization development, so as to  
increase internal talent mobility and allow them to  
utilize their talents and grow. TSMC s e orts have yielded

concrete results: in 2019, 50.8% of all job vacancies were  
 lled through internal transfers, thereby achieving the  
Company s short-term target. As part of its long-term  
strategy for human resource development, TSMC has set  
another target: by 2030, no less than 75% of manager  
positions shall be  lled through internal promotions.  
TSMC promotes self-learning by cultivating a self-learning  
mindset in employees and o ering diversi ed learning  
resources and learning tools. Employees are encouraged  
to engage in learning at all places, at all times, and  
in all forms in line with the company s direction of  
development, the speci c needs of each organization,  
and personal requirements. A self-learning culture  
enhances work performance, facilitates corporate growth,  
and contributes to social progress. 
Transparent Framework for Employee  Development and Job Rotation 
To retain talents, TSMC o ers a comprehensive framework  
for employee development, whereby a dual career  
ladder system covering both management and technical  
positions allows employees to explore their full potential in  
either of the two types of positions according to personal  
characteristics and skills.  
Furthermore, the promotion system in the employee  
development framework is based on two major principles:  
transparency on internal vacancies and respect for  
employees  transfer decisions. It considers development  
potential as an important indicator for evaluating  
candidates for promotion. A handbook on promotion  
procedures and numerous relevant tools are o ered to  
managers to help them assess candidate potential.

Operators had to carry the maintenance  tools onto the top of the tank when  performing quarterly pump oil change  for the waste water and pure water  system. 
To collect waste oil, the operator had  to keep a fixed posture and waste oil  e uent into the bucket by gravity. Each  operation took 6.5 hours. 
The operators designed a special  jig. By injecting air into the system,  the jig automatically pushes out the  residual oil, which then  ows through  a tube into the waste bucket. The time  needed for the operation was thus  reduced to 1 hour.

Safety Performance Index  
TSMC s Safety Performance Index (SPI) were classi ed  
into four levels and two subtypes active index and  
passive index. The active index encourages employees  
to participate in safety and health programs and raise  
suggestions for safety improvements, while the passive  
index shows the number of safety related defects,  
false alarm incidents. In 2019, the  blue light  indicator  
appeared slightly less frequently than the previous year,  
from 89.4% to 88.8%. The decline was mainly caused  
by the increase of the number of near miss, andfalse  
alarm incidents from 10 to 21, 11 of which were personal  
injuries, 6 of which were  re false alarms, and 4 of which  
were gas false alarms.

     On-site contractors are guaranteed zero risk of  chemical exposure in TSMC premises. 
     Contractors are ensured easy access to safety and  health management procedures. 
     The Blue Book on Environmental Safety and Health  for Contractors was created 
     Reporting of abnormal results from special health  examinations: Contractors are required to report  to TSMC any abnormal results from special health  examinations that can be attributed to work-related  causes according to the Labor Health Protection Act. 
     TSMC dispatched its occupational physicians to  inspect the operations on on-site contractors and  analyze their risks of chemical exposure. 
Working with Supply Chain Partners  to Achieve Sustainable Development 
TSMC has conducted safety and health on-site  
inspection on suppliers and o ered guidance whenever  
needed. During 2017 and 2019, TSMC worked with the  
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and  
Associate professor Yu-Wen Lin from the Department  
of Public Health of the Medical College of Fu-Jen  
Catholic University in carrying out the Supply Chain  
Occupational Health Promotion Program. The joint  
task force co-inspected 37 TSMC suppliers in  elds  
including parts wafer cleaning, pump repair, chemicals  
supply, and recycling, and provided instant feedback  
for improvements. Common challenges faced by similar  
businesses were identi ed, and their solutions, including  
ventilation system maintenance, respiratory protection  
plan, and dermal protection practices, were incorporated  
into education programs. Furthermore, TSMC sought to  
enhance the capabilities of safety o cers to identify and  
address problems. In education programs, therefore,  
lectures were gradually replaced with interactive  
discussions to help vendors develop the capacity to  
proactively improve their environments. 
In addition, TSMC organized in 2019 a conference on  
ISO 45001 Certi cation for Occupational Safety and  
Health Management System in collaboration with the  
Industrial Technology Research Institute to help vendors  
and contractors alike improve their management of  
occupational safety and health. In the conference,  
high risk contractors were introduced to management  
strategies, aided in conducting self-inspections on their  
work environments, and instructed to become ISO 45001  
certi ed by 2021.

Develop   Donate Shower Gurneys for  Elderly Care 
Elder people who have lain in bed for a long time are  
often unable to shower and bathe because of limited  
mobility or the lack of appropriate showering equipment.  
TSMC s Facility Division developed a shower gurney  
that can meet such a demand. It can prevent water  
from clogging and subsequently resulting in injuries to  
the users. It is also great for helping those with limited  
mobility to bathe and clean, thus improving their quality  
of life. In 2019, TSMC donated 21 shower gurneys to  
related social welfare groups.

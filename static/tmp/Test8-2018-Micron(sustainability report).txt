About Micron Strategy    Governance 
Welcome to our 2018 Sustainability Report. Micron is a world leader in semiconductors   one of  the most technologically advanced manufacturing processes ever developed. The solutions we create transform  the way the world uses information to enrich life, driving breakthroughs in scientific research and power-saving  revolutions like lights-out data centers. Our industry requires constant innovation with a sharp eye toward the future. 
I believe strongly, however, that these advancements do not mean much unless they are paired with our own  dedication to sustainable manufacturing practices and a commitment to supporting our communities. The choices  we make today will help ensure we have the resources and talent we will need in the years ahead. 
Our sustainability achievements in the last year include actions taken to benefit our environment,   our people, and our communities: 
    Water Resilience   Energy Efficiency  We mindfully conserve energy and   
   protect water resources by adapting to local conditions and constraints. 
    Diversity   Inclusion  We cultivate a diverse and inclusive culture at Micron,   
   which continues to attract a broad talent pool. 
    Community Investment  We focus our giving efforts to ensure our communities   
   and education partners have the resources to support and educate the next   
   generation of scientists, inventors, and engineers. 
    Supply Chain  Just as our customers expect more from us, we are working   
   closer than ever with our supply chain partners to ensure we are sourcing   
   materials responsibly. 
I am proud of the progress we have made and look forward to continued improvement in the years ahead.  
Thank you for reading our report. I invite you to provide feedback about Micron s sustainability efforts by emailing  sustainability micron.com.

Our Manufacturing Operations   
The foundation of our memory and storage solutions is our memory chips  (or die). These semiconductors are manufactured on a substrate known as  a silicon  wafer  at our wafer fabrication facilities (fabs) located in Singapore,  Taiwan, Japan and the United States.  
Each 300-millimeter wafer is placed through numerous manufacturing  steps where materials are precisely applied to select areas of the wafer  to create hundreds of individual die. This process can take more than a  month and requires hundreds of precise steps from the moment a new  wafer enters the fab until it is finished. Our wafer manufacturing takes place  at the nanoscale in a cleanroom environment. Particle levels, temperature,  and humidity are tightly controlled to ensure the quality of the final memory  chip as it passes through up to 10 process areas, each with a unique set of  tools. Once complete, a wafer is divided into its constituent die, which are  then assembled into numerous customized formats, designed to enable a  myriad of technologies.  
Our complex manufacturing process requires major investments in   facilities, equipment and talented team members around the world. We  have 12 manufacturing facilities spread across six different countries and   more than 50 offices in 17 countries.

A Sustainable Design  Micron made a number of strategic shifts in 2017 to ensure   we are using all resources, including our team talent, as  effectively as possible. Most significantly, we initiated plans  to create manufacturing, technology and business centers of  excellence (COE),  which will allow us to benefit from scale  while reducing waste and inefficiencies associated with a   more distributed manufacturing model. This approach yields  multiple benefits. It achieves the most efficient and effective  technology transfer and acceleration of manufacturing  production by combining front- and back-end manufacturing,  product engineering and technology development (R D) roles.  It also reduces the environmental impact and waste associated  with the transport of work-in-progress components between  distant facilities. 
In Singapore, three wafer fabrication facilities and one assembly  and test facility serve as the base for our worldwide NAND  COE, driving the implementation of the company s leading- edge 3D NAND production for use in mobile phones, solid  state drives (SSDs) and more. Taiwan serves as Micron s DRAM  COE and includes two state-of-the-art fabrication facilities in  Taichung and Taoyuan and a co-located backend facility in  Taichung. The leading DRAM technology from these facilities  is integrated into computers, servers, networking devices,  communications equipment, consumer electronics, automotive  and industrial applications.

Sustainability Issues 
Materiality  
Underpinning our Sustainability Council s strategic process is our  triennial materiality assessment. Our materiality assessment starts with  an exhaustive list of sustainability issues that cover all aspects of our  business. We then consider input from internal and external stakeholders  to understand the issues of greatest importance to both groups. The  results are plotted on a graph to visualize the relationship of the issues  most important to our stakeholders and most important to our business  success. We use this map as a tool to identify those areas where we  have the greatest potential to drive meaningful change and those areas  appropriate for increased transparency. The materiality assessment  also serves as the primary means for defining the issues material to our  annual sustainability report.

Micron s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics   
We have a long-standing tradition of doing business with integrity. Our  Code of Business Conduct and Ethics sets clear expectations for all  Micron leaders, organizations, team members, contractors and suppliers.  The Code is communicated to these stakeholders through multiple  channels, and our team members are routinely trained on its tenets.  
Today s laws and standards of business conduct are complex, and our  Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is intended to be a practical resource  that outlines the basic rules that Micron applies to our business regarding  risk, legal and ethical issues. It also explains the personal responsibility of  each Micron team member to speak up if they see something that does  not seem right. All aspects of our Code support each team member and  the company as a whole in conducting business with integrity   with one  another, with our investors, our communities and in our marketplace.

About this  
We recently updated our Code to make it more actionable, engaging  and aligned with today s challenging and rapidly evolving business  environment. During this process we worked with highly-experienced  external consultants and numerous internal groups and executives. Our  board of directors gave final approval of the new Code. Our employees  receive regular computer-based training and certify annually that they   have read, understand and will continue to comply with the Code.   Micron s Senior Vice President, Legal Affairs, General Counsel,   Corporate Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for  ongoing maintenance of the Code. The Code is available to all on our  external web site and to team members on an internal SharePoint site.    
In addition to the Code, we have adopted a number of other global   policies. Pursuant to our global policy framework (a.k.a.,  policy on  policies ), global policies are reviewed and vetted by a policy council  comprised of director and vice president-level executives, initially  approved by a policy committee comprised of senior and executive   vice presidents, and finally approved by our Chief Executive Officer.  The Code and all other global policies, including translations in seven  languages, are available to all team members on an internal SharePoint  site. Regular computer-based training regarding these policies and   other legal and ethical requirements are provided to targeted team  members, based upon their job function. We also provide frequent,  targeted live group and one-on-one training.  
We educate and encourage all team members, vendors and third-parties  to speak up when they see a suspected violation of our Code to each  other, their managers, Micron s Legal Department or to report through   our compliance hotline. This hotline is third-party operated, available   24 hours of every day and in all commonly used languages, and   provides anonymous reporting capability and executes protocols   designed to help avoid potential conflicts of interest.

Team Members  We continuously engage with our team members. This  is not limited to ongoing supervisor interactions, but is solicited through a  host of team member-focused channels, such as team member meetings.  Periodically, senior leaders host these meetings to inform and encourage  team members to bring forward issues and questions. We also maintain  a robust intranet rich with information concerning global and local Micron  initiatives relevant to each team member and our operational success.  This intranet serves as a social media platform where employees can post  thoughts, opinions, questions and suggestions, as well as learn about the  benefits and opportunities available to them as a Micron team member. In  2017, our new CEO solicited unprecedented team member feedback with  a company-wide challenge. Sanjay s Challenge invited team members to  provide ideas on how to improve Micron through a global platform. Every  suggestion was reviewed by a senior leader with the ability to influence  decisions concerning the suggestion. Many were adopted and recognized  for their contribution to our continuous improvement efforts. Specific to  sustainability suggestions, our team members are encouraged to provide  feedback to us via sustainability micron.com. 
Customers  We routinely meet with our customers to understand how we  are performing from their perspective. Cross-functional teams review the  outcomes of those conversations, as well as written customer requirement  documents, and assess opportunities for improvement. A monthly meeting  of executives and senior leaders drives accountability for the improvements  we undertake in response to key customer expectations and requirements.  Additionally, we engage in several industry organizations alongside our  customers, building industry consensus across a range of social and  environmental issues specific to our industry   such as conflict minerals,  supply chain labor standards and climate-related matters.

Risk   Resilience  
Our enterprise risk management (ERM) program is one of the primary   tools we use to create a unified approach to understanding risk and  formulating strategies, processes, and decisions. Micron s Risk Committee  is appointed by our CEO and reports major findings to the Board of  Directors  Audit Committee. 
When risks are identified, our risk management personnel conduct formal  assessments and analysis based on business intelligence and trends. We  then prioritize the issues based on the company s overall risk exposure.   Our risk management team then recommends actions and Micron leaders  are accountable for managing risks affecting their areas of responsibility. 
Crisis and business continuity management supports our ERM program   by preparing our critical operations to respond, recover and restore  operations if a disruption occurs. Business continuity plans are in place  for all critical operations and take an all-hazards approach, meaning  we prepare for a disruption to all elements of our value chain, such as  workforce, facilities, information technology or supply chain. 
Looking Forward  
In 2018 we will disclose the results of our most recent triennial materiality  assessment to stakeholders and leverage its findings to further refine our  sustainability strategy and programs. While most outcomes of this effort are  consistent with the results of our prior assessment, some new matters will  merit increased and ongoing attention. Additionally, the sustainability and  risk and resilience teams are partnering to further integrate sustainability  issues within the enterprise risk framework in 2018 and to consider all  mitigating treatments and or opportunities. We are also developing tools  to dive deeper into our customer and investor expectations to improve  stakeholder engagement.

Our Approach  
In the early stages of planning and production, we work to identify  opportunities to reduce our operational impact to the environment and   the communities where we operate. This requires a blend of corporate  global strategy and local adaptation to the unique challenges and  opportunities that each of our facilities and operating locations present.   We do this in a number of ways, including:  
    Engaging our robust network of site-based Environmental Health   
                 Safety (EHS) professionals throughout our global operations 
    Exploring and implementing opportunities to build  
        manufacturing, infrastructure and office space designed to   
               conserve environmental resources 
    Executing and certifying 14001 and 18001 environmental and   
   safety management systems at all manufacturing locations  
    Aligning critical environmental practices in our manufacturing to    
   corporate standards (often exceeding local legal requirements)

Our intent is to minimize the impact to this precious resource   and maximize our business resilience as global water supply becomes  increasingly constrained. 
Our total water consumption in CY2017 was 46,866,000 m3   for our front end and back end manufacturing sites. This figure is up  from our CY2016 performance and reflects the incorporation of a   new acquisition finalized in 2017, in addition to a production increase.  While this water consumption figure is large, our global water recycling  initiatives at our manufacturing sites achieved a  53% recycling rate  in that same time period. 
Sustainable management of our water footprint begins by understanding  our water sourcing. Globally, the primary source for water at our  manufacturing locations is municipal supply   suggesting the   importance of our partnerships with our local water authorities.

We consider these relationships within their local context, seeking to  understand the implications of different geographies, climates, watersheds  and infrastructure. We then apply these assessments to determine the best  approach to water management at each site.  
In Boise, Idaho, we are mindful of our potential impact to our local   aquifer that supplies the majority of our water in that location. We were   early investors in technology, starting in 1999, that allows us to replenish   the aquifer and mitigate our withdrawal impacts. In Taichung, Taiwan, and  Hiroshima, Japan, our manufacturing sites reclaim water at a rate above  70% of the total process water used in facility operations. In Singapore,  we take a blended approach. In addition to water reclaim systems at our  wafer fab facilities, we have installed rainwater capture infrastructure at our  expanded North Coast fabrication site, also known as Fab 10X, and source  98% of our water from reclaim and or desalination facilities.

About this  
While our approach to water supply and consumption mitigation reflects  a local, adaptive approach, our commitment to assuring our industrial  wastewater discharges meet all environmental legal requirements is  universal. Each of our sites has invested in significant water treatment  infrastructure to assure that the quality of any wastewater leaving our site  meets or exceeds applicable water quality standards. Our sites also employ  staff responsible for the ongoing operation and routine maintenance of  our wastewater systems to assure performance over time. Wastewater  treatment methods may vary by site, but includes membrane filtration,  ion-resin absorption, precipitation, bio-oxidation, and neutralization.  We routinely sample our wastewater discharges for conformance to  environmental standards. In CY2017, we discharged 36,998,000 m3 of  treated wastewater, with 84% of that discharge sent to publicly operated  treatment works (POTWs).

The cleanest energy is the energy never used. At Micron, we embrace this  maxim and keep energy management front of mind. We utilized a year- on-year energy reduction goal in 2016 and transitioned to a multi-year  goal in 2017 to achieve at least 10% energy savings (measured in KWh  saved compared to 2016 baseline year energy use) by 2022. Consolidated  savings projects have achieved a 4% reduction compared to energy use  in 2016. Overall, our 2017 energy consumption worldwide was 7,431,413  MWh including all manufacturing sites.

Greenhouse Gases   
What gets measured gets managed. That is why our approach to  greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) begins with collecting, analyzing  and reporting data specific to these emissions. In fact, we have  been reporting on our GHG emissions since 2009 through the   CDP, formerly Carbon Disclosure Project. CDP is the primary  international organization enabling standardized environmental data  reporting on greenhouse gases and other environmental criteria for  companies, cities, states and regions. 
In 2017, we focused our GHG data reporting on scope 1 and 2   emissions from our manufacturing locations, as that is where we  believe our biggest opportunity rests. Scope 1 emissions include  our direct emissions while scope 2 emissions represent the emissions  affiliated with our purchased energy. We also report on select scope  3 criteria. For the most current information on our greenhouse gas  performance, please see our annual disclosure to CDP. We anticipate  providing additional information on our 2017 performance in   our 2018 CDP submittal. 
Looking Forward   
In 2018, we plan to take our energy management and greenhouse gas  efforts to the next level by expanding our GHG reporting to include  select Scope 3 emissions, exploring energy profile reporting of our  main products and initiating development of a global energy strategy.  Additionally, we look forward to driving increased water recycling rates  across our manufacturing network.

Safe, Healthy   Secure  
Micron maintains a safe, healthy, and secure workplace through  proactive efforts to prevent occupational illnesses and injuries. We hold  managers and supervisors responsible for leading, implementing and  maintaining safe, secure and compliant work areas. Management, team  members, and contractors are expected to help identify, eliminate and  control Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS)-identified hazards and  risks. All team members and contractors follow relevant EHS procedures  and applicable legal requirements, including those contained in our Code  of Business Conduct and Ethics.  
Every Micron manufacturing site has health and safety committees  comprised of both management and non-management team members.  The committees are designed to cover and promote overall site operations  and communications to ensure routine messaging reinforces Micron s  safety programs, recognizes safe behaviors and highlights engagement  activities. This aligns with our multi-site OHSAS 18001 certifications, the  recognized standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management  
Micron makes many significant investments in its business, but few are  more substantial and important than those it makes in its team members.  The company undertook a global pay analysis in 2017 to measure gender  pay equity in all its worldwide locations. The analysis compared base  salary between team members while taking various business factors into  consideration, including but not limited to job duties, skills, responsibility  levels, location, overall performance level, and time in role.

Excellence in Technical   Professional Leadership   
At Micron, high-potential team members are connected with opportunities to  develop leadership and technical skills. Our leadership development programs are  designed to go beyond the classroom to challenge our current and future leaders  to solve critical business cases using newly developed skills and behaviors. These  programs have been recognized with awards from Brandon Hall in 2016 and  HR.com in 2017. For senior leaders, we provide a 12-week Micron Leadership in  Action (MLA) program that includes classroom training labs where coaches and  executive skill champions provide guidance to participants on solving real-world  business problems.  
We offer a similar, consolidated program to give mid-level leaders (mid-level MLA)  access to the skills development necessary to become our future senior leaders.  Through this experienced-based approach, our leaders not only contribute to  projects that have a significant impact on Micron s bottom line, they also gain   and refine the leadership and networking skills necessary to help drive the  company s evolution.  
Team members identified as promising leaders of tomorrow are invited to participate  in the Future Leaders Program (FLP). This allows us to retain and engage future  leaders while maintaining a pipeline of talent in a highly-competitive industry.  
For our technologists, we have established a parallel career development path  through the Technical Leadership Program (TLP). Fueling innovation and promoting  collaboration across functions, the TLP offers a platform to engage Micron s brilliant  technologist community through shared technical papers, seminars and forums.

Utilized Suppliers: 
Our Approach  
Micron manages a complex supply chain across the globe that includes  a variety of materials, equipment and services relevant to our operations.  While cost, quality and schedule are ongoing areas of focus, we ve  expanded our efforts in recent years to identify potential social and  environmental risks for key suppliers. This includes dedicated resources   for monitoring and addressing these risks for both new and existing  suppliers. We believe this increased sourcing rigor improves the  sustainability of our operations while improving social and  environmental conditions throughout the industry s supply chain.

Supply Chain Risk Management  
Our intent is to build a resilient and sustainable supply chain. 
With suppliers in 52 countries, Micron must address a myriad of potential  supply chain risks, from natural disasters to financial vulnerability to  human rights issues. Managing our supply base is a critical and complex  undertaking. This requires a team of dedicated professionals, who guide  our supplier evaluation and approval process to assure new and existing  suppliers meet our expectations, including those related to social and  environmental criteria. Our supplier risk assessments align to our  Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Responsible Business  Alliance Code of Conduct (RBA  formerly referred to as the Electronics  Industry Code of Conduct), and additional requirements as referenced in  our Supplier Qualification Requirements Document (SQRD) and other  documents.

Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) plays a critical role in a our  approach to supplier management. We firmly believe that the best  supply chain results are achieved when the industry comes together to  uphold a single set of expectations regarding social and environmental  responsibility and a single process for demonstrating conformance.  Through RBA training materials, monitoring tools, and third-party  audits, we are able to support the efforts of our key suppliers to  maintain responsible operations. We can also hold them accountable  when they veer off course. To comply with the RBA Code in our own  operations, we have adopted a vigorous management approach that  includes training team members on the code requirements and using  third-party auditors to verify our actions. Our global RBA oversight  team includes representatives from legal, human resources, EHS,  and supplier management functions. They monitor key RBA metrics  across all of our manufacturing locations and review quarterly reports  on Micron s overall RBA performance.

About Micron Strategy    Governance 
Report Environment People Communities GRI Content  
By communicating our expectations to our suppliers, we strive to have  responsible supply chain practices replicated throughout our supply  chain. By profiling and managing the relative risks of each of our strategic  suppliers, we better ensure that our global operations are prepared for  continuous production and product delivery to our customers   while  upholding industry and Micron standards relating to sustainability. As a  check on this process, we maintain our continuously monitored compliance  hotline for the reporting of violations in our supply chain.  
Forced Labor   Child Labor  
As members of the supply chain ourselves, our Code aligns with the RBA  Code of Conduct, which explicitly states child labor or forced labor is  not permitted in any stage of the business. Micron factories are regularly  audited for conformance with these standards and our hiring policy requires  team members to be 18 or older. Micron actively works to uphold the  highest level of labor ethics in our own operations and we also expect our  suppliers and partners to adhere to our Code and child labor and forced  labor laws. Our commitment to these concerns is made public through  our Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement. Micron hired Thomson  Reuters in 2017 to perform a screen of Micron s entire supplier base and  did not find any evidence of forced labor incidents. As part of our ongoing  due diligence in this area we regularly conduct supplier risk assessments to  understand how well the supplier addresses the issues, with specific focus  on operations in areas more at risk for human rights violations.

OUR COMMITMENT 
Assessing 100%   of new and existing  suppliers against  compliance risk  (environmental, social  and ethical elements)  and operational risk  (factors related to  business continuity)  demonstrates our  commitment to  improve Micron s  performance in the  area of responsible  sourcing.

Conflict Minerals  
Like many technology companies, Micron relies on the use of tin, tungsten,  tantalum, and gold in the manufacture of our products. These materials,  known as conflict minerals, are abundant in the Democratic Republic of the  Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries.  
We want to help end these human rights abuses by doing our part to enable  a DRC conflict-free supply chain. Micron has adopted a goal of sourcing  entirely from smelters validated as conflict-free by third-party audit. To this  end, we seek to align to international due diligence best practices set forth  in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development s  (OECD) Due Diligence Guidelines for Responsible Supply Chains of  Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas and comply with  section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act, which requires publicly traded U.S. companies to track,  monitor, and report annually on conflict minerals in supply chains.      We believe collaboration among government, industry, and communities  is key to achieving a conflict-free supply chain. Reflecting this philosophy,

Report Environment People Communities GRI Content  
Micron was a founding member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI),  a respected consortium that works across the minerals industry to develop  a common approach to address conflict mineral supply chains and develop  future protocols that may expand to include other minerals. RMI includes  a third-party auditing process, due diligence tools, and a public database  documenting where each smelter stands in its conflict-free journey.  
Our strategy to drive a conflict-free supply chain focuses on two clear,  achievable goals:  
We are committed to transparency, and report publicly on our due diligence  and progress toward a conflict-free supply chain. We also require similar  reporting from suppliers. To learn more, read our annual Conflict Minerals  Report.  
Looking Forward 
As a key supplier to many of the world s most recognizable brands, we  recognize our responsibility as a supply chain partner and our direct influence  on suppliers to make meaningful changes that benefit the global community.  To strengthen Micron s responsible sourcing performance efforts in 2018 and  assure we are making a positive difference throughout our supply chain, we  will continue to enhance how we evaluate and interact with high-risk suppliers.  These efforts include increased due diligence and auditing for both existing and  new suppliers, and closely monitoring risk levels across several factors.  
1. Ensure our existing suppliers source exclusively  from suppliers reliant on smelters and refiners that  have been verified as compliant with appropriate due  diligence protocols. 
2. Engage exclusively with new suppliers that can  demonstrate the same capability.

Our Approach 
As a global leader in memory and storage technology, Micron s solutions are  unleashing new possibilities. From emerging fields to world-changing projects,  the need to analyze, access and act on data has never been greater.  
With data considered the new currency of business, our company also influences  the sustainability aspects of those who use our products. This means consistently  improving our products to achieve higher performance, user privacy and data  protection, faster data transfer rates, lower power consumption, improved reliability  and reduced hazardous materials.  
To ensure performance in these areas, we work with our customers to  understand their needs related to user privacy and data protection. With that in  mind, Micron also invests in research to develop new technologies and systems  that deliver energy efficiency to further address customer requests. Through  supplier engagement, technology development and legal compliance we evaluate  new materials to ensure the safety of our team members and the reduction of  hazardous materials in our products.   
Product Efficiency 
We recognize that the energy demand of our products contributes to the global  environmental impact of technology. This is why we partner with our customers  to deliver memory solutions that meet tightening requirements and expectations  for energy efficiency. Our System Power Calculator is an online tool available to  our customers to help them estimate memory power requirements when making  important system and architecture and design decisions. This information helps our  customers make choices that can influence the overall energy footprint of the end  devices our products enable.

Data Protection   User Privacy 
We work closely with our customers to understand their needs related to user privacy  and data protection, while also looking at industry trends and potential vulnerabilities.  A specific area of growth, and vulnerability, is the Internet of Things (IoT) and the  Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). By 2020, global research and advisory company  Gartner estimates more than 25% of identified enterprise attacks will involve IoT. In  2017, malware threats bypassed traditional computing devices to focus specifically on  IoT. The threat is far-reaching, given the susceptibility to cyber attacks of embedded  systems, which are in everything from factory automation equipment to automobiles  to smart home devices. Micron announced its Authenta NVM security solution in  2017 to directly address these system-level security concerns.  
Authenta builds on Micron s leadership in the market and its industry, where it  remains active with the Trusted Computing Group (TCG)   an industry standards  body that develops and maintains the open standards and specifications for self- encrypting drives (SEDs) and other secure,  trusted  devices. Micron became a  contributing, voting member of the TCG in 2009. The company subsequently  launched one of the industry s first solid state SEDs intended for mobile computing  and has developed drives that meet the rigorous Federal Information Processing  Standards (FIPS), as detailed in our 2017 Sustainability Report. You can learn  more about our SEDs and the United States FIPS standards in a recent whitepaper  detailing data security features for SSDs.  
Another critical area of our sustainability focus, specific to products, is hazardous  substances. Our goals are twofold. First, we aim to ensure product compliance  with legal and customer requirements, such as the European Union Directive on the  restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances (RoHS) and the Registration,  Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). Second, we aim   to deliver new products quickly by using a proactive product compliance validation   and certification process.

Micron s Authenta  technology provides unique, powerful  measures that are added to the root level of a flash device to  address a specific gap in IoT device security.  
 Our technology can build upon existing levels of security as  defense in depth layered security where previously it may have  been too costly. The premise is simple: We re leveraging existing  standard non-volatile memory (NVM) sockets, or flash memory,  to do some heavy-lifting that protects the integrity of the device  itself as well as the software that runs on the device.

Our EHS organization, product compliance group and procurement  teams are responsible for ensuring that Micron products and processes  meet customer and legal product compliance requirements. When new  items are added to relevant regulatory lists, our procurement team queries  all Micron suppliers and subcontractors and requires a response within   45 days informing us of use and or providing a non-use certificate. We  also expect our suppliers to monitor the development of the candidate list  for potential inclusions in Annex XIV and or XVII of the REACH regulation.  We also seek to reduce the environmental impact of our products through  regular review of content and packaging needs. All of these efforts provide  our customers with the satisfaction we are striving to provide products that  meet quality, technology, service, delivery and sustainability expectations.    
Additionally, Micron and all its subsidiaries, are committed to compliance  with all export and economic sanctions laws and regulations in all of the  countries in which we operate. Compliance with export laws is vital to  protecting the safety and security of the countries in which we operate  and to ensure our products, software and technology do not fall into the  hands of entities and persons that seek to do harm, such as terrorists and  weapons proliferators.      Looking Forward  
We will continue to explore possibilities to address critical sustainability  opportunities in future generations of Micron memory solutions. We will be  the first company to launch an enterprise SATA SSD built on industry-leading  64-layer 3D NAND, which offers several market-leading advantages in  performance, capacity, value and reliability. As Micron improves performance  levels of its technology to increase energy efficiency while protecting human  health and the environment, it will continue to identify opportunities to  advance data security and protection efforts in the marketplace and through  industry alliances.

About this  
From our earliest days, Micron established a tradition of giving back and  enriching the communities where our team members live and work. Just   as our company has evolved over the years and expanded globally, so   have our efforts to align more closely with the needs of our communities  and industry.  
This enhanced focus was formalized in 1999, when the Micron Foundation  was established. Today it continues to serve as the heart of our giving  efforts. Through our Foundation, we support and help develop programs  to promote science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education   and to align our giving practices more closely with the priorities and values  of our team members and the communities where they live and work. 
Today Micron operates in 17 countries worldwide and employs roughly  32,197 team members from a multitude of cultures. Because our charitable  impact is greatest in the locations where we operate, and because  our innovation depends on a pipeline of talented team members, our  Foundation initiatives prioritize the communities surrounding our locations  and the educational institutions that educate and prepare for the future  semiconductor workforce. We routinely engage with local community,  government and university representatives in all of the communities where  we manufacture our products to understand how we can better engage to  mitigate any social or environmental impacts we may have, and to foster  stronger STEM education programs that contribute to the development of  the future high tech workforce.  
In 2017, the Micron Foundation awarded more than 550 grants   worldwide and donated more than  10,000,000 to education-   and community-related causes.

Inspiring the Innovators of Tomorrow  
Micron relies on talented scientists and engineers to be a global leader in  memory and storage solutions, so cultivating those who teach the future  innovators and the innovators themselves aligns naturally with how and  why we give back. The Foundation s STEM giving engages a twofold  approach: give educators the resources, training, and tools they need to  spark a passion for STEM among students and create engaging, hands-on  experiences for students themselves. Additionally, the Foundation explored  ways to develop an increased pipeline of women in the engineering  workforce through programs like Girls Going Tech.  
Team Members Know Best: Charity of Choice  
The Foundation also directs resources to community priorities   not just  perceived priorities   but the priorities identified by passionate community  members themselves, our team members. This is illustrated by the  Foundation s Charity of Choice program launched in 2014. The program  allows team members to vote for the charities that matter most to them  and their communities based on their manufacturing site s location. The  site then focuses both its volunteer efforts for the year and a monetary  donation to the winning cause. Charities apply these funds to programming  supporting vulnerable populations around the globe.

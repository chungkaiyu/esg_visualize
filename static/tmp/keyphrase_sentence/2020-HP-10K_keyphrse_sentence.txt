the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns  of past losses.", "For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of  the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years  reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.", "As a result, we reduced  estimated ultimate losses for prior years\u2019 loss events by $160 million.", "We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of  the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion.", "We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends.", "In establishing  our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under  various scenarios.", "We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined.", "We  then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information  concerning the underlying losses.", "We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant  deviations from expected results are revealed.", "Our  estimated liabilities for such claims were

impact on our ultimate liabilities.", "We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020,  which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $230 million.", "In 2020, we paid losses  and loss adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion with respect to these contracts.", "In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract  inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received.", "We  amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing  and amount of loss payments.", "We also adjust

goodwill needed to be  reevaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2020.", "We determined it was necessary to quantitively reevaluate  goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC.", "As a result of our reviews, we recorded  pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638  million of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC.", "Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing  circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing  for impairments.", "As of December 31, 2020, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance  Sheet was not impaired.", "Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units at this time is and will likely be significantly  affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the

"The industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry.", "Variability in our customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results.", "The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.", "The changes in demand may require our

portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability.", "As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict.", "Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes.", "We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products.", "If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.", "Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in

transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the implementation of business continuity plans; requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on- site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects; and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of

difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen.", "In addition, there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks, threats and incidents in a timely manner, or at all, or to respond expediently, appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents, and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products.", "In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of \u201cbig data\u201d or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers.", "Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes.", "Our business is affected by our customers\u2019 use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes.", "Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.", "Outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization.", "These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become

performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability.", "The importance of these factors varies by product and market segment.", "For example, our competitors have introduced data center and client platform products with performance improvements and additional processor core counts that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment.", "In our IOTG business, for example, interoperability, connectivity, safety, security, industrial use conditions, and long-life support are among the key competitive

compete with internally developed semiconductors from OEMs, cloud service providers, and others, some of whom are customers.", "Some of these customers vertically integrate their own semiconductor designs with their software assets and/or customize their designs for specific computing workloads.", "For example, in 2020, Apple introduced PC products utilizing its own internally developed ARM-based semiconductor designs in place of our client CPUs.", "Most of our competitors rely on third-party foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. (TSMC) or Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and subcontractors for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor components and products.", "Manufacturing process improvements introduced by TSMC have contributed, and may continue to contribute, to increasingly competitive offerings by our competitors.", "We also face new sources of competition as a result of changes in industry

initiatives, such as our unified oneAPI portfolio of developer tools.", "In addition, we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new product designs.", "To the extent our R&D efforts do not timely produce semiconductor designs for our platform products with improvements in areas like performance, performance per watt, die utilization, and core counts, and with new features such as optimizations for AI and other workloads, our competitive position can be harmed.", "We have adopted a disaggregated design approach for some of our future products, in which different processors and components can be manufactured on different processes and connected by advanced packaging technology into a single package.", "This approach introduces new areas of complexity in design and manufacturability, particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technologies, several of which are novel, have a limited manufacturing history, and/or have increased costs.", "Delays or failures in implementing disaggregated designs could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive products.", "We do not expect all of our R&D investments to be successful.", "Some of our efforts to develop and market new products fail, and the products and technologies we invest in and develop are not always well received by customers, who may adopt competing technologies.", "Our

in key technology inflections such as AI, 5G networking, and the intelligent and autonomous edge.", "We have expanded our adjacent product offerings in client computing, the data center, the Internet of Things, and memory, with offerings such as discrete GPUs, silicon photonics solutions, and Intel Optane technology products.", "For example, in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for the business.", "These new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our expanded TAM, and they also introduce new sources of competition, including, in some of these market segments, incumbent competitors with established technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices or costs, and greater brand recognition.", "These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes utilize technologies that are different from the ones that we develop and manufacture, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments.", "For example, AI and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to develop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas.", "Similarly, while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge, we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our efforts.", "To be successful, we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments.", "In addition, we must continually improve the cost, performance, integration, time-to-market, and energy efficiency of our products, as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions.", "Some of these new businesses face challenging market conditions.", "For example, market pricing for NAND memory products has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.", "Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.", "Our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due in part to marketability of our products and differences in their features or manufacturing costs.", "For example, our platform product offerings range from lower-priced and entry-level platforms, such as those based on Intel Atom processors, to higher-end platforms based on Intel Xeon processors.", "Our adjacent products also typically have significantly lower margins than our higher-priced platform products, and at times are not profitable.", "To the extent demand shifts from our higher-priced to lower-priced platform products in any of our market segments, or our adjacent products represent an increasingly greater share of our mix of products sold, our gross margin percentage may decrease.", "We are vulnerable to product and manufacturing-related risks.", "We are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technologies.", "Production of integrated circuits is a complex process.", "We are continually engaged in the development of next-generation process technologies at increasingly advanced nodes as we seek to realize the benefits of Moore's Law.", "Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials, and other issues.", "Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes.", "We are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes.", "We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology.", "Although we began shipping products based on our 10nm process technology in volume in 2019, our delays in transitioning to this node occurred while third-party foundries such as TSMC developed new, competitive process technologies.", "In 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in yield degradation, which was the primary driver for a delay in our expectations for our 7nm-based CPU product timing.", "These delays can allow competitors to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us by third-party foundries and could adversely affect the competitiveness of our products.", "Because of the delays in our 10nm and 7nm process technologies, we may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products.", "To increase our manufacturing and design flexibility, we have developed a disaggregated design approach for certain products, which enables us to manufacture processors and components on different process technologies, including third-party foundry processes, and connect them in a single package with advanced packaging technologies.", "Our efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance of the process node introduction.", "We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&D investments, particularly as development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive.", "Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships.", "Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, including additional cores or other competitive features in our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs.", "Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs and adversely affect our gross margins, and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraints.", "When we introduce a new process node, it typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields.", "For example, our increased 10nm product mix in 2020 had a negative impact on our overall unit cost and gross margins, and yields on our 10nm manufacturing process remain below our mature 14nm process.", "As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have shrunk, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields.", "From time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, interruptions in our supply of materials or resources, and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions\u2014all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields.", "Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations.", "In addition, delays in our product introductions can cause us to become less competitive and lose revenue opportunities, and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant costs up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these costs over time.", "Thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business.", "Where possible, we seek to have several sources of supply.", "However, for certain materials and equipment, including certain photolithography tools, we rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single location.", "In addition, supplier consolidation or business failures can impact the nature, quality, availability, and pricing of the products and services available to us.", "The inability of suppliers to deliver necessary production materials or equipment can disrupt our production processes and make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy.", "Suppliers periodically extend lead times, face capacity constraints, limit supplies, increase prices, experience quality issues, or encounter cybersecurity or other issues that can interrupt or increase the cost of our supply.", "The unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources at times requires us to reduce production or incur additional costs, which could harm our business and results of operations.", "Our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by IP or other litigation between our suppliers, where an injunction against Intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to Intel by others.", "We also rely on third-party providers to manufacture, assemble and test, and supply certain components and products, including for areas such as networking, communications, programmable semiconductor solutions, and memory.", "We may utilize third-party providers for these and other components and products in the future.", "In some cases there are limited or no readily available satisfactory alternate providers.", "In any of these circumstances, we can encounter supply delays or disruptions or incur additional costs that could prevent us from meeting customer demand and/or adversely affect our business and financial results.", "For example, while we have a supply agreement with Micron providing for the supply of Intel 3D XPoint memory, we may need to fund and develop internal manufacturing options to continue 3D XPoint memory supply in the longer term.", "We typically have less control over delivery schedules, design and manufacturing co-optimization, manufacturing yields, quality, product quantities, and costs for components and products that are manufactured or supplied by third parties.", "Our disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies.", "To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints.", "We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others.", "Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product.", "In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues.", "To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed, our costs could increase, and our business and results of operation could be adversely affected.", "Increased regulation or stakeholder expectations regarding responsible sourcing practices could cause our compliance costs to increase or result in publicity that negatively affects our reputation.", "Moreover, given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials, but do not directly control the procurement or employment practices of such suppliers, we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risks as a result of our suppliers' conduct.", "We are subject to the risks of product defects, errata, or other product issues.", "From time to time, we identify product defects, errata (deviations from published specifications), and other product issues, which can result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes.", "Components and products we purchase or license from third-party suppliers, or attain through acquisitions, can also contain defects.", "Product issues can lead to product failures, unpredictable system behavior, system instability, and other issues, and sometimes result from the interaction between our products and third-party products and software.", "We also face risks if products that we design, manufacture, or sell, or that include our technology, cause personal injury or property damage, even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata.", "These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, market segments, technologies, or applications, including transportation, autonomous driving, healthcare, communications, financial services, and other industrial, critical infrastructure, and consumer uses.", "Mitigation techniques designed to address product issues, including software and firmware updates, are not always available on a timely basis\u2014or at all\u2014and do not always operate as intended or effectively resolve such issues for all applications, and can result in

to address security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, are not always available on a timely basis\u2014or at all\u2014and at times do not operate as intended or effectively resolve vulnerabilities for all applications.", "In addition, we are often required to rely on third parties, including hardware, software, and services vendors, as well as our customers and end users, to develop and/or deploy mitigation techniques, and the availability, effectiveness, and performance impact of mitigation techniques can depend solely or in part on the actions of these third parties in determining whether and how to develop and deploy mitigations.", "We and such third parties may make prioritization decisions about which vulnerabilities to address, which can delay, limit, or prevent development or deployment of a mitigation and harm our reputation.", "Security vulnerabilities and/or mitigation techniques can result in adverse performance or power effects, reboots, system instability or unavailability, loss of functionality, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, decisions by customers and end users to limit or change the applications in which they use our products or product features, and/or the misappropriation of data by third parties.", "Security vulnerabilities and any limitations of, or adverse effects resulting from, mitigation techniques can adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, customer relationships, prospects, and reputation in a number of ways, any of which may be material.", "Adverse publicity about security vulnerabilities or mitigations could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services.", "These effects may be greater to the extent that competing products are not susceptible to the same vulnerabilities or if vulnerabilities can be more effectively mitigated in competing products.", "Moreover, third parties can release information regarding potential vulnerabilities of our products before mitigations are available, which, in turn, could lead to attempted or successful exploits, adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigations, or otherwise harm our business and reputation.", "Our failure to comply with these laws or regulations can result in regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales.", "These restrictions could harm our

deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in production, planning and inventory management and regulatory compliance that could seriously harm our business.", "Third-party suppliers may have limited financial resources to withstand challenging business conditions, particularly as a result of increased interest rates or emerging market volatility, and our business could be negatively impacted if key suppliers are forced to cease or limit their operations.", "In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions

experienced disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in temporary supply shortages that negatively affected our ability to fulfill demand for Personal Systems and Printing products worldwide.", "Additionally, our Personal Systems business relies heavily upon OMs to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those OMs to fulfill demand for our products.", "We represent a substantial portion of the business of some of these OMs, and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular OM could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the OM and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that OM.", "If shortages or delays

that we utilize.", "Our competitors may obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in relationships with certain OMs and suppliers could be limited.", "In addition, our OMs and suppliers may decide to discontinue business with us.", "We also rely on

customized for our products.", "New products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers.", "Replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations.", "For some

their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end- user demand.", "Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods, including a multi-tiered channel, may reduce our visibility into inventories, demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting and managing multi-tiered channel inventory more difficult.", "Further, if we were to expand direct distribution initiatives, distributors could consider such initiatives to conflict with their business interests and reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of our products, or to cease all sales of our products.", "Sales of our products by channel partners to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of our products could also make our forecasting and channel inventory management more difficult and impact pricing in the market.", "For example, in the past we have had channel partners sell products outside of their agreed territory, and misrepresent sales to unauthorized resellers as sales to end-users, frustrating our efforts to estimate channel inventory and maintain consistent pricing, and negatively impacting gross margins.", "If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory.", "In addition, factors in different markets may cause differential discounting between the geographies where our products are sold, which makes it difficult to achieve global consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey marketing.", "Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.", "This uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems.", "If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory.", "Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled by the customer.", "Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels, our results of operations and cash flows in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected. example, sales to governments (particularly sales to the U.S. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year.", "European sales are often weaker during the summer months.", "Demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends.", "Moreover, to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product", "Our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors.", "Our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter\u2019s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter.", "We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and

Some of the risks associated with the pandemic or a worsening of the pandemic in the future include:    \u2022  cancellation or reduction of routes available from common carriers, which may cause delays in our ability to deliver or  service our products or receive components from suppliers necessary to manufacture or service our products;  \u2022  travel bans or the requirement to quarantine for a lengthy period after entering a jurisdiction, which may delay our  ability to install the products we sell or service those products following installation;  \u2022  governmental orders or employee exposure requiring us, our customers or our suppliers to discontinue manufacturing  products at our respective facilities for a period of time;  \u2022  reduced demand for our products, push-out of deliveries or cancellation of orders by our customers caused by a global  recession resulting from the pandemic and the measures implemented by authorities to slow the spread of COVID-19;  \u2022  increased costs or inability to acquire components necessary for the manufacture of our products due to reduced  availability;  \u2022  absence of liquidity at customers and suppliers caused by disruptions from the pandemic, which may hamper the  ability of customers to pay for the products they purchase on time or at all, or hamper the ability of our suppliers to  continue to supply components to us in a timely manner or at all; and  \u2022  loss of efficiencies due to remote working requirements for our employees.

enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products  or enhancements.", "In addition, we cannot be sure that these products or enhancements will receive market acceptance or that we  will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.", "Our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to  sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products.", "Success in the industries in which we serve, including the semiconductor, flat panel display and printed circuit board  industries depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions.", "The  primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the  circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver appears to be slowing, which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to  delay investments in equipment, investigate more complex device architectures, use new materials and develop innovative  fabrication processes.", "These and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development  programs and cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support.", "Technical innovations  are inherently complex and require long

Some of the risks associated with the pandemic or a worsening of the pandemic in the future include:    \u2022  cancellation or reduction of routes available from common carriers, which may cause delays in our ability to deliver or  service our products or receive components from suppliers necessary to manufacture or service our products;  \u2022  travel bans or the requirement to quarantine for a lengthy period after entering a jurisdiction, which may delay our  ability to install the products we sell or service those products following installation;  \u2022  governmental orders or employee exposure requiring us, our customers or our suppliers to discontinue manufacturing  products at our respective facilities for a period of time;  \u2022  reduced demand for our products, push-out of deliveries or cancellation of orders by our customers caused by a global  recession resulting from the pandemic and the measures implemented by authorities to slow the spread of COVID-19;  \u2022  increased costs or inability to acquire components necessary for the manufacture of our products due to reduced  availability;  \u2022  absence of liquidity at customers and suppliers caused by disruptions from the pandemic, which may hamper the  ability of customers to pay for the products they purchase on time or at all, or hamper the ability of our suppliers to  continue to supply components to us in a timely manner or at all; and  \u2022  loss of efficiencies due to remote working requirements for our employees.

market acceptance or that we  will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us.", "Our business will be seriously harmed if we are unable to  sell our products at favorable prices or if the market in which we operate does not accept our products.", "Success in the industries in which we serve, including the semiconductor, flat panel display and printed circuit board  industries depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions.", "The  primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the  circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver appears to be slowing, which may cause semiconductor manufacturers to  delay investments in equipment, investigate more complex device architectures, use new materials and develop innovative  fabrication processes.", "These and other evolving customer plans and needs require us to respond with continued development  programs and cut back or discontinue older programs, which may no longer have industry-wide support.", "Technical innovations  are inherently complex and require long

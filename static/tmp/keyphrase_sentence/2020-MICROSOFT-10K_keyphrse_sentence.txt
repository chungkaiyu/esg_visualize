Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the  paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss

the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns  of past losses.", "For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of  the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years  reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.", "As a result, we reduced  estimated ultimate losses for prior years\u2019 loss events by $160 million.", "We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of  the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new  exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.", "Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates.", "Claim liabilities  relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are

losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion.", "We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends.", "In establishing  our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under  various scenarios.", "We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined.", "We  then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information  concerning the underlying losses.", "We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant  deviations from expected results are revealed.", "Our  estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020.", "When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying  loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses.", "Judgments in these areas necessarily  consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated.", "Legal reform  and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.", "We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020,  which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $230 million.", "In 2020, we paid losses  and loss adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion with respect to these contracts.", "In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract  inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received.", "We  amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing  and amount of loss payments.", "We also adjust

intangible asset  exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.", "If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit,

goodwill needed to be  reevaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2020.", "We determined it was necessary to quantitively reevaluate  goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC.", "As a result of our reviews, we recorded  pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638  million of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC.", "Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing  circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing  for impairments.", "As of December 31, 2020, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance  Sheet was not impaired.", "Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units at this time is and will likely be significantly  affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the

COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be worse than we currently estimate and could lead us to record additional  goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in 2021.", "We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values.", "A significant amount of judgment is required in  estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests.", "Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to  market risks.", "Our significant market

quantitative impairment assessments for our Media reporting unit in 2019 and 2018.", "During the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018, consistent with our accounting policy, we applied a combination of a market approach and a discounted cash flow method reflecting current assumptions and inputs, including our revised projections, discount rate and expected growth rates, which resulted in the determination that the fair value of the Media reporting unit was less than its carrying amount.", "As a result, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of approximately $186 million ($176

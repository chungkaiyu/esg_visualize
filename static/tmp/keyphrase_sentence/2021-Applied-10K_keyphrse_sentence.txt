performance.", "Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.", "Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost to us of such

predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or services we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation.", "While we strive to adhere our practices and procedures to these laws, they are subject to evolving regulations, interpretations and regulator discretion.", "To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; loss of licenses; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug suppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages and/or penalties.", "In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory

exclusive forum for claims, including derivative claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, associate or shareholder in such capacity or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery.", "The exclusive forum provision may increase the costs for a shareholder to bring a claim or limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, associates or shareholders in such capacity, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons.", "Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, the claims as to which they are intended to apply, then we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations.", "While the exclusive forum provision applies to state and federal law claims, our shareholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with, and the exclusive forum

to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs.  At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate.  We define our financial framework as:", "As we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.", "We are providing extra pay and benefits, including special cash bonuses to associates and the introduction of a COVID-19 Emergency Leave Policy in the U.S. \u2022 Serving our customers as safely as possible and keeping our supply chain operating.", "We operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve.", "We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales growing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses.", "For fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points compared to the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales.", "As we execute our financial framework, we believe our return on capital will improve over time.", "We measure return on capital with our return on assets, return on investment and free cash flow metrics.", "We also provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.", "While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.", "Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.", "The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the losses on certain international operations held for sale or sold, partially offset by the fair value change in our equity investments as well as the increase in operating income.", "We define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period.", "We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.", "Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.", "For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI.", "As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI.", "Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.", "As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.", "Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company\u2019s financial performance.", "Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity.", "We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period.", "We had net cash provided by operating activities of $36.1 billion, $25.3 billion and $27.8 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.", "We generated free cash flow of $25.8 billion, $14.6 billion and $17.4 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.", "Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.", "As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.", "The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP

billion or 1.9% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.", "These increases were partially offset by $4.1 billion of negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates in fiscal 2020 and our sale of the majority stake in Walmart Brazil in August 2018.", "Our gross profit rate increased 20 basis points and decreased 40 basis points for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.", "For fiscal 2020, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 8 basis points, when compared to the previous fiscal year, due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sales.", "The gain in fiscal 2021 primarily reflects $8.7 billion in net gains associated with the fair value changes of our equity investments, partially offset by the $8.3 billion pre-tax loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for sale or sold in fiscal 2021.", "Our effective income tax rate was 33.3% for fiscal 2021, 24.4% for fiscal 2020, and 37.4% for fiscal 2019.", "The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is primarily due to the loss related to the divestiture of certain international operations classified as held for or sold in fiscal 2021, which provided minimal realizable tax benefit.", "The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to the fiscal 2019 loss on sale of a majority stake in Walmart Brazil, which increased the previous comparative fiscal year's effective tax rate, as it provided minimal realizable tax benefit.", "Our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate as a result of various factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that, beginning in fiscal 2019, are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate.", "We leveraged operating expenses in fiscal 2021 primarily as a result of strong sales, which were partially offset by $3.2 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic including special bonuses, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, costs associated with outfitting our stores and associates with masks, gloves and sanitizer, and expanded cleaning practices.", "The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2021 was primarily due to $0.5 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by positive comparable sales in the majority of our markets and lapping the impairment charges in the prior year discussed below.", "Fiscal 2020 was also benefited by gains on property sales and other income.", "Despite increased net sales from the strong demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves.", "The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity.", "Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt

remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.", "We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund operations, finance our global investment and expansion activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for the foreseeable future.", "The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2020,

position or results of operations.", "Net cash used in investing activities was $10.1 billion, $9.1 billion and $24.0 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and generally consisted of payments for business acquisitions and to expand our eCommerce capabilities, invest in other technologies and supply chain, remodel existing stores and clubs and add new stores and clubs.", "Net cash used in investing activities increased $0.9 billion for fiscal 2021 when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily as a result of lapping the net proceeds received from the sale of our banking operations in Walmart Canada and the change in other investing activities, partially offset by decreased capital expenditures.", "Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, financing obligations, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock.", "The increase is primarily due to the timing of issuances and repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by both a reduction in cash used to pay down short-term borrowings as well as share repurchases as we manage our financial position during the current economic environment.", "We generally utilize the liquidity provided by short-term borrowings to provide funding for our operations, dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures and other cash requirements.", "We also have $15.0 billion of various undrawn committed lines of credit in the U.S. as of January 31, 2021 that provide additional liquidity, if needed.", "Additionally, we

activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.", "We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow.", "We believe cash flows from operations, our current cash position and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, which include funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.", "We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and

operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy.", "Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us.", "In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced

estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year-end.", "We evaluate long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.", "Thus, our accounting estimates may change from period to period.", "These factors could cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and require impairment tests be performed, which could result in management determining the value of long-lived assets is impaired, resulting in a write-down of the related long-lived assets.", "As a measure of sensitivity, fiscal 2021 impairment would not change materially with a 10% decrease in the undiscounted cash flows for the stores or clubs with indicators of impairment.", "We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.", "The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.", "For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use the income method.", "The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.", "Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary.", "If we determine, after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed.", "The quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions.", "Historically, our reporting units have generated sufficient returns to recover the cost of goodwill, as the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value.", "Our indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have also historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost.", "Due to certain strategic restructuring decisions, we recorded approximately $0.7 billion in impairment in fiscal 2020 related to acquired trade names and acquired developed software.", "We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable.", "We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies

occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements.", "We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made.", "Although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash

provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in certain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.", "Our effective income tax rate is affected by many factors, including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of

entering into currency swaps.", "The change in the fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of certain currencies relative to the U.S. dollar in fiscal 2021.", "The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $524 million.", "A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, 2021 would have resulted in a

equity features, such as direct investments in the equity or convertible securities of portfolio companies or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company.", "Any warrants we may receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments.", "We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events.", "In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights.", "We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment but may sell certain investments earlier if a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale or refinancing of a portfolio company.", "Our investment objectives and investment strategies are similar to those of other client accounts managed by our Investment Adviser (including GS PMMC and GS PMMC II), and an investment appropriate for us may also be appropriate for those Accounts.", "This creates potential conflicts in allocating investment opportunities among us and such other Accounts, particularly in circumstances where the availability of such investment opportunities is limited, where the liquidity of such investment opportunities is limited or where co-investments by us and other Accounts are not permitted under applicable law.", "We are prohibited under the Investment Company Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent

include investments in the same portfolio company) with such affiliates, absent the prior approval of the Independent Directors.", "Our Investment Adviser and its affiliates, including persons that

significant overlap in our investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of GS PMMC, GS PMMC II and/or other funds managed by our Investment Adviser.", "If our Investment Adviser identifies an investment and we are unable to rely on our exemptive relief for that particular opportunity, our Investment Adviser will be required to determine which Accounts should make the investment at the potential exclusion of other Accounts.", "In such circumstances, the Investment Adviser will adhere to its investment allocation policy in order to determine the Account to which to allocate the opportunity.", "The policy provides that our Investment Adviser allocate opportunities through a rotation system or in such other manner as our Investment Adviser determines to be equitable.", "Accordingly, it is possible that we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by other Accounts.", "We may also invest alongside other Accounts advised by our Investment Adviser and its affiliates in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law and SEC staff guidance and interpretations.", "For example, we may invest alongside such Accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the staff of the SEC permitting us and such other Accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that our Investment Adviser, acting on our behalf and on behalf of its other clients, negotiates no term other than price.", "We may also invest alongside our Investment Adviser\u2019s other clients as otherwise permissible under SEC staff guidance and interpretations, applicable regulations and the allocation policy of our Investment Adviser.", "To address these

purchase and sale decisions and allocate investment opportunities among Accounts consistent with its fiduciary obligations.", "There will be cases where certain Accounts receive an allocation of an investment opportunity when we do not and vice versa.", "Goldman Sachs has a conflicts system in place above these information barriers to identify potential conflicts early in the process and determine if an allocation decision needs to be made.", "If the conflicts system detects a potential conflict, the legal and compliance departments of Goldman Sachs assess investment opportunities to determine whether a particular investment opportunity is required to be allocated to a particular Account (including us) or is prohibited from being allocated to a particular Account.", "Personnel of our Investment Adviser involved in decision-making for Accounts may make allocation related decisions for us and other Accounts by reference to one or more factors, including: the Account\u2019s

different desired levels of investment for different strategies; the expected future capacity of the applicable Accounts; limits on our Investment Adviser\u2019s brokerage discretion; cash and liquidity considerations; and the availability of other appropriate investment opportunities.", "Suitability considerations, reputational matters and other considerations may also be considered.", "The application of these considerations may cause differences in the performance of different Accounts that have similar strategies.", "In addition, in some cases our Investment Adviser may make investment recommendations to Accounts where the Accounts make the investment independently of our Investment Adviser, which may result in a reduction in the availability of the investment opportunity for other Accounts (including us) irrespective of our Investment Adviser\u2019s policies regarding allocation of investments.", "Additional information about our Investment Adviser\u2019s allocation

57(k) of the Investment Company Act, to compensation from us or from the borrowers in connection with such investments.", "Any compensation we pay in connection with such referrals will be an operating expense and will accordingly be borne by us (and will not serve to offset any Management Fee or Incentive Fee (each as defined below) payable to the Investment Adviser).", "In connection

co-investments disclosed herein (collectively, \u201cApplicable Law\u201d), we and/or our Investment Adviser may have the opportunity to offer all or a portion of the excess amounts of such investment opportunity to other persons or entities.", "These opportunities include, for example, where our Investment Adviser has determined that while it is in our best interests to acquire the full amount of an investment available to it if the alternative is to not make the investment at all, it is further in our best interests of, due to diversification, portfolio management, leverage management, investment profile, risk tolerance or other exposure guidelines or limitations, cash flow or other considerations, for us to hold less economic exposure to the investment than such full amount.", "Subject to Applicable Law, such opportunities may be structured as an investment alongside us or as a purchase of a portion of the investment from us (through a syndication, participation or otherwise).", "In all cases, subject to Applicable Law, our Investment Adviser has broad discretion in determining to whom and in what relative amounts to offer such opportunities, and factors our Investment Adviser may take into account, in its sole discretion, include whether such potential recipient is able to assist or provide a benefit to us in connection with the potential transaction or otherwise, whether our Investment Adviser believes the potential recipient is able to execute a transaction quickly, whether the potential recipient is expected to provide expertise or other advantages in connection with a particular investment, whether our Investment Adviser is aware of such potential recipient\u2019s expertise or interest in these types of opportunities generally or in a subset of such opportunities or, the potential recipient\u2019s target investment sizing.", "Recipients of these opportunities may, in accordance with Applicable Law, include one or more investors in us, one or more investors in other funds managed by the GSAM Credit Alternatives Team, clients or potential clients of Goldman Sachs, or funds or accounts established for any such persons.", "These opportunities may give rise to potential conflicts of interest.", "These opportunities will be offered to the recipients thereof on such terms as our Investment Adviser determines in its sole discretion, subject to Applicable Law, including on a no-fee basis or at prices higher or lower than those paid by us.", "As a result of these and other reasons, returns with respect to an opportunity

compliance with covenants;", "As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments.", "This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also

neutral to favorable.", "All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2;   \u2022 Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt

example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us.", "In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us.", "Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the Investment Company Act imposes on us as a BDC.", "While we expect to use the industry information of GSAM\u2019s investment professionals to which we have access to

make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such a compensation arrangement and also to incur leverage, which will tend to enhance returns where our portfolio has positive returns.", "Our Investment Adviser receives the Incentive Fee based, in part, upon capital gains realized on our investments.", "As a result, our Investment Adviser may have an incentive to invest more in companies whose securities are likely to yield capital gains, as compared to income-producing securities.", "Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during cyclical economic downturns.", "The Incentive Fee payable

accrue the interest over the life of the investment but do not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term.", "Our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our Incentive Fee, however, includes accrued interest.", "Thus, a portion of this Incentive Fee is based on income that we have not yet received in cash.", "This risk could be increased because our

respect to original issue discount (\u201cOID\u201d), payment-in-kind (\u201cPIK\u201d) interest and zero coupon securities).", "If we increase leverage, the management fees payable to our Investment Adviser will be higher than if we did not use leverage, irrespective of the return on the incremental assets.", "In addition, as leverage generally would magnify positive returns, if any, on our portfolio, as noted above, the use of leverage may cause our net investment income to exceed the quarterly hurdle rate for the Incentive Fee on income payable to our Investment Adviser at a lower average return on our portfolio.", "The Incentive Fee based on income takes into account our past performance.", "The effect of calculating the Incentive Fee using reference to the Trailing Twelve Quarters is that, in certain limited circumstances, an Incentive Fee based on income will be payable to our Investment Adviser although our net income for such quarter did not exceed the hurdle rate or the Incentive Fee will be higher than it would have been if calculated based on our performance for the applicable quarter without taking into account the Trailing Twelve Quarters.", "For example, if we experience a net loss for any particular quarter, an Incentive Fee may still be paid to our Investment Adviser if such net loss is less than the net loss for the most recent quarter that preceded the Trailing Twelve Quarters.", "In such circumstances, our Investment Adviser would be entitled to an Incentive Fee whereas it would not have been entitled to an Incentive Fee if calculated

significant potential conflicts of interest that could negatively impact our investment returns.", "A number of these potential conflicts of interest with affiliates of our Investment Adviser and Group Inc. are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this report.", "Such additional businesses and interests will likely give rise to potential conflicts of interest and may restrict the way we operate our business.", "For example, (1) we may not be able to conduct transactions relating to investments in portfolio companies because our Investment Adviser is not permitted to obtain or use material nonpublic information in effecting purchases and sales in public securities transactions for us or (2) Goldman Sachs, the clients it advises, and its personnel may engage (or consider engaging) in commercial arrangements or transactions with us (subject to any limitations under the law), and/or may compete for commercial arrangements or transactions in the same types of companies, assets, securities or other assets or instruments as us.", "Transactions by, advice to and activities of such accounts (including potentially Goldman Sachs acting on a proprietary basis), may involve the same or related companies, securities or other assets or instruments as those in which we invest and may negatively affect us (including our ability to engage in a transaction or other activities) or the prices or terms at which our transactions or other activities may be effected.", "For example, Goldman Sachs may be engaged to provide advice to an account that is considering entering into a transaction with us, and Goldman Sachs may advise the account not to pursue the transaction with us, or otherwise in connection with a potential transaction provide advice to the account that would be adverse to us.", "Such compensation might incentivize GS & Co. or its employees or personnel to refer opportunities or to recommend investments that might otherwise be unsuitable for us.", "Further, any such compensation paid by us, or paid by the borrower (to which we would otherwise have been entitled) in connection with such investments, may negatively impact our returns.", "Although our Investment Adviser and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities among their clients, including us, in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures, it is expected that, in the future, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by other Accounts or that we may participate in such investments to a lesser extent due to participation by such other Accounts.   In addition, Goldman Sachs or another investment account or vehicle managed or controlled by Goldman Sachs may hold securities, loans or other instruments of a portfolio company in a different class or a different part of the capital structure than securities, loans or other instruments of such portfolio company held by us.", "As a result, Goldman Sachs or such other investment account or vehicle may pursue or enforce rights or activities, or refrain from pursuing or enforcing rights or activities, on behalf of its own account, that could have an adverse effect on us.", "In addition, to the extent Goldman Sachs has invested in a portfolio company for its own account, Goldman Sachs may limit the transactions engaged in by us with respect to such portfolio company or issuer for

market, but GS & Co. will limit its collective ownership with Group Inc. to below 25.0% of our outstanding common stock.", "Therefore, Group Inc. is able to exert, and may be able to continue to exert, influence over our management and policies and have significant voting influence on most votes requiring stockholder approval.", "This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of us, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of us and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.", "Our Investment Adviser has the authority to vote securities held by Group Inc., including on matters that may present a conflict of interest between our

payable on debt investments we make, default rates on such investments, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the

performance in future periods or the full fiscal year.", "We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates.", "Our debt investments may be based on floating rates, such as LIBOR, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or the Prime Rate.", "General interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments, the value of our securities and our rate of return on invested capital.", "Currently, most of our floating rate investments are linked to LIBOR and it is unclear how increased regulatory oversight and the future of LIBOR may affect market liquidity and the value of the financial obligations to be held by or issued to us that are linked to LIBOR, or how such changes could affect our investments and transactions and financial condition or results of operations.", "However, the outbreak of COVID-19 may adversely impact the timing of many firms\u2019 transition planning, and we continue to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our transition plans.", "The elimination of LIBOR or any other changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR or alternative reference rates could have an adverse impact on the market for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us.", "In addition, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the credit agreements extending beyond 2021 with our portfolio companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, in order to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established, which may have an adverse effect on our overall financial condition or results of operations.", "As such, some or all of these credit agreements may bear a lower interest rate, which would adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.", "Moreover, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate certain terms of our Revolving Credit Facility.", "If we are unable to do so, amounts drawn under the Revolving Credit Facility may bear interest at a higher rate, which would increase the cost of our borrowings and, in turn, affect our results of operations.", "Because we have borrowed money, and may issue preferred stock to finance investments, our net investment income depends, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds or pay distributions on preferred stock and the rate that our investments yield.", "As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.", "A reduction in the interest rates on new investments relative to interest rates on current investments could also have an adverse impact on our net interest income.", "However, an increase in interest rates could decrease the value of any investments we hold which earn fixed interest rates, including subordinated loans, senior and junior secured and unsecured debt securities and loans and high yield bonds, and also could increase our interest expense, thereby decreasing our net income.", "Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock.", "Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield.", "In periods of rising interest rates, to the extent we borrow money subject to a floating interest rate, our cost of funds would increase, which could reduce our net investment income.", "Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if such increases cause our borrowing costs to rise at a rate in excess of the rate that our investments yield.", "Further, rising interest rates could also adversely affect our performance if we hold investments with floating interest rates, subject to specified minimum interest rates (such as a LIBOR floor), while at the same time engaging in borrowings subject to floating interest rates not subject to such minimums.", "In such a scenario, rising interest rates may increase our interest expense, even though our interest income from investments is not increasing in a corresponding manner as a result of such minimum interest rates.", "If general interest rates rise, there is a risk that the portfolio companies in which we hold floating rate securities will be unable to pay escalating interest amounts, which could result in a default under their loan documents with us.", "In addition, rising interest rates may increase pressure on us to provide fixed rate loans to our portfolio companies, which could adversely affect our net investment income, as increases in our cost of borrowed funds would not be accompanied by increased interest income from such fixed-rate investments.", "A change in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to a change in the interest rate we receive on many of our debt investments.", "Accordingly, a change in the interest rate could make it easier for us to meet or exceed the performance threshold in the Investment Management Agreement and may result in a substantial increase in the amount of incentive fees payable to our Investment Adviser with respect to the portion of the Incentive Fee based on income.", "Interest rates in the United States are currently at historically low levels.", "Certain countries have experienced negative interest rates on certain fixed-income instruments.", "Very low or negative interest rates may magnify interest rate risk.", "Changing interest rates, including rates that fall below zero, may have unpredictable effects on markets, may result in heightened market volatility and may detract from our performance to the extent we are exposed to such interest rates and/or volatility.

we are unable to raise our customers\u2019 rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of

they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or at all, in which case we may be unable to provide such content as part of Cable Communication\u2019s video services, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.", "We also are incurring significant costs to develop Peacock, and there can be no assurance that consumers and advertisers will embrace this offering.",

"We also may be unable to license popular third-party content for NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s programming channels if media companies determine that licensing the content to us is not in their strategic best interests (for example, they may launch DTC streaming or other OTT services for their owned content, forgo license fees from us and only provide their content directly to consumers or they may license their content on an exclusive basis to certain of our competitors or rival DTC streaming or other OTT service providers).", "Entering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights may result in significantly increased costs.", "Particularly with respect to long-term contracts for sports programming rights for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors, including the strength of the advertising market, audience size, the timing and amount of rights payments, and the ability of NBCUniversal to secure distribution from, impose surcharges on, or obtain carriage on multichannel video providers.", "There can be no assurance that revenue from these contracts will exceed our costs for the rights, as well as the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.", "If our content does not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, or if we cannot obtain or retain rights to popular content on acceptable terms, or at all, NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses may be adversely affected.", "The number of subscribers to NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks has been, and likely will continue to be, reduced as a result of fewer subscribers to multichannel video providers.", "In addition, we expect not to license certain popular content, and we may decide not to license additional owned popular content, to third parties so we may offer it exclusively through Peacock, which would result in foregone licensing revenue.", "There can be no assurance that any of these agreements will be entered into or renewed in the future on acceptable terms.", "The inability to enter into or renew these agreements could reduce our revenues and the reach of our programming, which could adversely affect NBCUniversal\u2019s and Sky\u2019s businesses.", "Less favorable European telecommunications access regulations, the loss of Sky\u2019s transmission access agreements with satellite or telecommunications providers or the renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms could adversely affect Sky\u2019s businesses.", "If there is a change in regulation in these markets, the regulated terms could become less favorable.", "Legal challenges to our intellectual property rights and claims of intellectual property infringement by third parties could require that we enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question, from importing into the United States or other jurisdictions in which we operate hardware or software that uses such intellectual property or from the continuation of our businesses as currently conducted.", "Moreover, if we are unable to obtain or continue to obtain licenses from our vendors and other third parties on reasonable terms, our businesses could be adversely affected.", "The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material negatively affects our ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content, as well as from the sale of advertising in connection with our content, and increases our costs due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property rights.", "In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution platforms continues to present challenges for NBCUniversal\u2019s cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses, and certain illegal online entities may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to us.", "While piracy is a challenge in the United States, it is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that lack developed copyright laws, effective enforcement of copyright laws and technical protective measures like those in effect in the United States.", "If any U.S. or international laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property rights are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced, or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technologies that facilitate piracy, we may be unable to effectively protect our rights, the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our costs of enforcing our rights may increase.", "A substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions.", "For example, weak economic

Unfavorable changes in health care or other benefit costs or reimbursement rates or increased competition in those geographic  areas where our membership is concentrated could therefore have a disproportionately adverse effect on our Health Care  Benefits segment\u2019s operating results.", "We are exposed to risks relating to the solvency of other insurers.", "We are subject to assessments under guaranty fund laws existing in all states for obligations of insolvent insurance companies  (including long-term care insurers), HMOs, ACA co-ops and other payors to policyholders and claimants.", "For example, in the  first quarter of 2017, Aetna recorded a discounted estimated liability expense of $231 million pretax for our estimated share of  future assessments for long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one of its subsidiaries.  Guaranty funds are maintained by state insurance commissioners to protect policyholders and claimants in the event that an  insurer, HMO, ACA co-op and/or other payor becomes insolvent or is unable to

over the next several years.", "Overall, we project the benchmark rates in the Final Notice will increase funding for our Medicare Advantage", "This 2021 rate  increase only partially offsets the challenge we face from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care (including  prescription medications) and CMS local and national coverage decisions that require us to pay for services and

meet applicable network adequacy requirements.", "CMS\u2019 decisions on our requests for service area expansions also may be affected adversely by compliance issues that arise each year in our Medicare operations. \u2022 CMS regularly audits our performance to determine our compliance with CMS\u2019s regulations and our contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of the services we provide to our Medicare members.", "As a result of these audits, we may be subject to significant or material retroactive adjustments to and/or withholding of certain premiums and fees, fines, criminal liability, civil monetary penalties, CMS imposed sanctions (including suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs) or other restrictions on our Medicare, Medicaid and other businesses, including suspension or loss of licensure. \u2022 \u201cStar ratings\u201d from CMS for our Medicare Advantage plans will continue to have a significant effect on our plans\u2019 operating results.", "CMS continues to change its rating system to make achieving and maintaining a four or higher star rating more difficult.", "Our star ratings and past performance scores are adversely affected by the compliance issues that arise each year in our Medicare operations.", "If our star ratings fall below four for a significant portion of our Medicare Advantage membership or do not match the performance of our competitors or the star rating quality bonuses are reduced or eliminated, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may be significantly adversely affected. \u2022 Payments we receive from CMS for our Medicare Advantage and Part D businesses also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individuals we enroll.", "Elements of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the DOJ, the OIG and CMS itself.", "Substantial changes in the risk adjustment mechanism, including changes that result from enforcement or audit actions, could materially affect the amount of our Medicare reimbursement, require us to raise prices or reduce the benefits we offer to Medicare beneficiaries, and potentially limit our (and the industry\u2019s) participation in the Medicare program. \u2022 Changes to the ability of PBMs to have pharmacy performance programs in place for clients and report payments via direct and indirect reporting mechanisms could impact the Pharmacy Services business. \u2022 Medicare Part D has resulted in increased utilization of prescription medications and puts pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rates due to regulatory and competitive pressures.", "Further, as a result of the ACA and changes to the retiree drug subsidy rules, clients of our PBM business could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefits to their Medicare-eligible members.", "To the extent this phenomenon occurs, the adverse effects of increasing customer migration into Medicare Part D may outweigh the benefits we realize from growth of our Medicare Part D products. \u2022 Our Medicare Part D operating results and our ability to expand our Medicare Part D business could be adversely affected if: the cost and complexity of Medicare Part D exceed management\u2019s expectations or prevent effective program implementation or administration; changes to the regulations regarding how drug costs are reported for Medicare Part D are implemented in a manner that adversely affects the profitability of our Medicare Part D business; changes to the applicable regulations impact our ability to retain fees from third parties including network pharmacies; the government alters Medicare Part D program requirements or reduces funding because of the higher-than-anticipated cost to taxpayers of Medicare Part D or for other reasons; the government mandated use of point-of-sale manufacturer\u2019s rebates effective in 2022 continues; the government makes changes to how pharmacy pay-for-performance is calculated; or reinsurance thresholds are reduced below their current levels. \u2022 We have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data for our Medicaid products due to difficulties with providers and third-party vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format, and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions.", "As states increase their reliance on encounter data, these difficulties could affect the Medicaid premium rates we receive and how Medicaid membership is assigned to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our Medicaid operating results and cash flows and/or our ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain Medicaid programs.", "This reduction is causing states to re-evaluate funding for their Medicaid expansions.", "That re-evaluation may adversely affect Medicaid payment rates, our Medicaid membership in those states, our revenues, our MLRs and our operating results. \u2022 If we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a CMS audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, civil monetary penalties or other sanctions, including fines and penalties under the False Claims Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in Medicare Advantage, Part D or other government programs, and on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. \u2022 In the second quarter of 2014, CMS issued a final rule implementing ACA requirements that Medicare Advantage and PDP plans report and refund to CMS overpayments that those plans receive from CMS.", "The precise interpretation, impact and legality of the final rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation.", "If Medicare Advantage plans were not paid based on payment model principles that align with the requirements of the Social Security Act or such payments were not implemented correctly, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. \u2022 Certain of our Medicaid contracts require the submission of complete and correct encounter data.", "The accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our Medicaid programs because more states are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standards and, in part, to set premium rates.", "We have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional costs to collect accurate, or to correct inaccurate or incomplete, encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding, operating sanctions and financial fines and penalties for noncompliance.", "We have experienced challenges in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulties with providers and third-party vendors submitting claims in a timely fashion in the proper format, and with state agencies in coordinating such submissions.", "As states increase their reliance on encounter data, these difficulties could affect the Medicaid premium rates we receive and how Medicaid membership is assigned to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our Medicaid operating results and cash flows and/or our ability to bid for, and continue to participate in, certain Medicaid programs. \u2022 Our businesses that dispense drugs also face challenges in the Medicaid space.", "The ACA made several significant changes to Medicaid rebates and to reimbursement rates.", "This change has adversely affected the reimbursements we receive when we dispense prescription drugs to Medicaid recipients.", "Programs funded in whole or in part by the U.S. federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues, and  we expect that percentage to increase.", "Programs funded in whole or in part by the U.S. federal government account for a significant portion of our revenues, and we  expect that percentage to increase.", "As our government funded businesses grow, our exposure to changes in federal and state  government policy with

Medicare, Medicaid, dual eligible and  dual eligible special needs plan businesses and from government customers in its Commercial business, are dependent on  annual funding by the federal government and/or applicable state or local governments.", "Federal, state and local governments  have the right to cancel or not to renew their contracts with us on short notice without cause or if funds are not available.  Funding for these programs is dependent on many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions,  continuing government efforts to contain health care costs and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state or local  level and general political issues and priorities.  The U.S. federal government and our other government customers also may reduce funding for health care or other programs,  cancel or decline to renew contracts with us, or make changes that adversely affect the number of persons eligible for certain  programs, the services provided to enrollees in such programs, our premiums and our administrative and health care and other  benefit costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and cash flows.", "When  federal funding is delayed, suspended or curtailed, we continue to receive, and we remain liable for and are required to fund,  claims from providers for providing services to beneficiaries of federally funded health benefits programs in which we  participate.", "also could lead to a delay, reduction, suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and a significant increase in  interest rates that could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, our ability to access the  capital markets and our businesses, operating results, cash flows and liquidity.", "Possible changes in industry pricing benchmarks and drug pricing generally can adversely affect our PBM and Retail/LTC  businesses.", "It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to  replace AWP or Wholesale Acquisition Cost (\u201cWAC\u201d), which are the pricing references used for many of our PBM and LTC  client contracts, drug purchase agreements, retail network contracts, specialty payor agreements and other contracts with third  party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payments.", "The use of an AAC  basis in FFS Medicaid could have an impact on reimbursement practices in Health Care Benefits\u2019 Commercial and other  Government products.  Future changes to the use of AWP, WAC or to other published pricing benchmarks used to establish drug pricing, including  changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health care programs and/or other payors, could impact  the reimbursement we receive from Medicare and Medicaid programs, the reimbursement we receive from our PBM clients and  other payors and/or our ability to negotiate rebates and/or discounts with drug manufacturers, wholesalers, PBMs and retail  pharmacies.", "A failure or inability to fully offset any increased prices or costs or to modify our operations to mitigate the impact  of such increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.", "Additionally, any future changes in drug prices  could be significantly different than our projections.", "We may not be able to obtain adequate premium rate increases in our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which would  have an adverse effect on our revenues, MBRs

Benefits products generally must be filed with state insurance regulators and are  subject to their approval, which creates risk for us in the current political and regulatory environment.", "Rate reviews can  magnify the adverse impact on our operating margins, MBRs and operating results of increases in health care and other benefit  costs, increased utilization of covered services, and ACA assessments, fees and taxes, by restricting our ability to reflect these  increases and/or these assessments, fees and taxes in our pricing.", "Further, our ability to reflect ACA assessments, fees and taxes  in our Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP premium rates is limited.", "Since 2013, HHS has issued determinations to health plans that their premium rate increases were \u201cunreasonable,\u201d

to have a history of \u201cunreasonable\u201d rate increases.", "Any significant rate  increases we may request heighten the risks of adverse publicity, adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the  likelihood that our requested premium rate increases will be denied, reduced or delayed, which could adversely affect our  MBRs and lead to operating margin compression.", "We anticipate continued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rates in our Insured Health Care  Benefits products.", "We may not be able to obtain rates that are actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policies  profitable in one or more product lines or geographies.", "If we are unable to obtain adequate premium rates and/or premium rate  increases, it could

of doing business, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial performance, among other things.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread and continuing impacts on the global economy and on our domestic and international associates, members, suppliers and other people and entities with which we do business.", "Customer demand for certain products has also fluctuated as the pandemic has progressed and customer behaviors have changed, which has challenged our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand.", "These factors have resulted in higher out-of-stock positions in certain products, as well as delays in delivering those products, and could impact inventory levels in the future.", "Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including whether there are additional outbreaks or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future mutations or related strains of the virus in areas in which we operate; further increased operational costs associated with operating during a global pandemic; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates, and recessionary pressures; unknown consequences on our business performance and initiatives stemming from the substantial investment of time, capital and other resources to the pandemic response; the availability of, and prevalence of access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19; the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides; and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including consumer behaviors.", "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased revenue growth relative to historic trends, and has particularly accelerated our eCommerce growth.", "Once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, particularly as vaccines become more widely available,

opportunities may result in declining revenue and future operating results may fall below expectations.", "To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the U.S. and the global economy, it may also heighten other risks described in this section, including but not limited to those related to consumer behavior and expectations, competition, our reputation,

requirements.", "Such events could result in physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our properties, the closure of one or more stores, clubs and distribution or fulfillment

affected by such events, the evacuation of the populace from areas in which our stores, clubs and distribution and fulfillment centers are located, the unavailability of our digital platforms to our customers, changes in the purchasing patterns of consumers (including the frequency of visits by consumers to physical retail locations, whether as a result of limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in consumers' disposable income, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some suppliers, the disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, the disruption or delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution and fulfillment centers or stores within a country in which we are operating, the reduction in the availability of products in our stores, the disruption of utility services to our stores and our facilities, and the disruption in our communications with our stores.", "These changes over time could affect, for example, the availability and cost of certain consumer products, commodities and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact our ability to procure those certain goods or

COVID-19 pandemic), the financial instability of suppliers, suppliers' failure to meet our terms and conditions or our supplier standards (including our responsible sourcing standards), labor problems experienced by our suppliers and their manufacturers, the availability of raw materials to suppliers, merchandise safety and quality issues, disruption or delay in the transportation of merchandise from the suppliers and manufacturers to our stores, clubs, and other facilities, including as a result of labor slowdowns at any port at which a material amount of merchandise we purchase enters into

failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage,

on our business and results of operations.", "Our digital platforms, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, including those applications and systems in our acquired eCommerce businesses, are regularly subject to cyberattacks.", "Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse and/or loss, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our digital platforms or otherwise significantly disrupt our customers' and members' shopping experience, our supply chain integrity and continuity, and our ability to efficiently operate our business.", "If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy for the growth of our business.", "Like most retailers, we receive and store in our information systems personal information about our customers and members, and we receive

threats and cyberattackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of hackers with a wide range of motives and expertise.", "The increased use of remote work infrastructure due to the COVID-19 pandemic has also increased the possible attack surfaces.", "Some of our systems and third-party service providers' systems have experienced limited security breaches or incidents and although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the future.", "Associate error or malfeasance,

intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security.", "Any compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions, customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from customers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations.", "Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems

service providers may not discover any security breach, vulnerability or compromise of information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs.", "Our compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk.", "In addition, such security-related events could be widely publicized and could materially adversely affect our reputation with our customers, members, associates, vendors and shareholders, could harm our competitive position particularly with respect to our eCommerce operations, and could result in a material reduction in our net sales in our eCommerce operations, as well as in our stores thereby materially adversely affecting our operations, net sales, results of operations, financial position, cash flows and liquidity.", "Moreover, a security compromise or ransomware event could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems created by the issue and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to guard personal and confidential information against cyberattacks and other attempts to access or otherwise compromise such information and could result in a disruption of our operations, particularly our digital operations.", "We cannot be certain that the security measures we maintain to protect

states.", "If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our pharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals.", "One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we sell, our cost of

in laws and other labor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.", "Our ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing number of qualified associates globally.", "Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to fill positions that become vacant at our

our components.", "The loss of, deterioration of our relationship with, or limits in allocation by, a single- source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance.", "If we cannot adequately address a component supply issue, we may have to re-engineer some product or service offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.", "Moreover, the process of developing new high-technology products, services and solutions and enhancing existing products, services and solutions is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate or respond to customers\u2019 changing needs (or the timing of those needs) and emerging technological trends accurately could affect our market share, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.", "In addition, our ability to successfully offer our products, services and

business conditions.", "products and technologies, including those created by our competitors, may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and end-user requirements and preferences and timely enhancement of our existing products and technologies or develop new ones.", "As a result, we could fail to maintain market leadership in certain of our products, such as commercial PCs and notebooks, and any of our products and technologies may be rendered uneconomical or obsolete.", "To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed in doing so within a given product\u2019s lifecycle or at all.", "Any delay in the development, production or

appropriate volumes while also managing costs and preserving or improving margins.", "Our alliance partners in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in others.", "For example, non-original supplies (including imitation, refill or remanufactured alternatives), which are often available at lower prices, compete with our Printing Supplies business and we may not be able to prevent the use of imitation print supplies with our printers using technological protection measures. distributors often sell our products alongside competing products, including non-original supplies, or they may highlight the availability of lower cost non-original supplies.", "We expect this competition will continue, and it may negatively impact our financial performance, particularly

quality and security issues may require us to repair or replace such products.", "In the event of security vulnerabilities or other issues with third-party components, we may have to rely on third parties to provide mitigation such as firmware updates.", "In addition, quality and security issues, including those resulting from defects or security vulnerabilities in third-party components, can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial

customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in net revenue.", "In addition, net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses, as we may lose cross-selling opportunities.", "Competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass on to our customers, increased tariffs, component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may also have a significant impact on our overall gross margin, profitability and cash flow.", "In addition, newer geographic markets can be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, as well as difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets.", "Market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, increased tariffs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations.", "For example, our supplies business has experienced declining revenues due to declines in installed base and usage.", "These factors could also make it difficult to accurately forecast revenues and operating results and could negatively affect our ability to provide accurate forecasts to suppliers and manufacturers, manage our relationships and other expenses and to make decisions about future investments.", "Customers are increasingly using online and omnichannel retailers, resellers and distributors to purchase our products.", "If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer.", "Successfully managing our global, multi-tier distribution network including the interaction of our direct sales and indirect channel sales efforts to reach potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process.", "Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, any failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins, and therefore, our profitability and cash flows.", "Our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels, the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or reduced assortments of our products, if we are not able to limit the potential misuse of pricing programs by our channel partners or we fail to optimize the use of our pricing programs.", "Moreover, some of our distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not

resellers as sales to end-users, frustrating our efforts to estimate channel inventory or maintain consistent pricing, and negatively impacting gross margins.", "In addition, factors in different markets may cause differential discounting between the geographies where our products are sold, which makes it difficult to achieve global consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey marketing.", "Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.", "This uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition, and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems.", "If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory.", "Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled by the customer.", "Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages, supply disruptions or logistics challenges could adversely impact our inventory levels, our results of operations and cash flows in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.", "Consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter due in part to seasonal holiday demand, and typically it has been our strongest quarter by revenues.", "Our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors.", "Our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter\u2019s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter.", "We experience seasonal trends in the sale of our products that may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition.", "Demand during the spring and early summer may also be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends.", "Moreover, to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margins.", "Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.", "We may not be able to execute acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully.", "When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives.", "In addition, we may experience fewer synergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected.", "Integrating acquisitions may be difficult and time-consuming.", "Any failure by us to integrate acquired companies, products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results, business and prospects.", "Integrations involve significant challenges and are often time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business.", "For example, we began implementing the 2020 restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and expect to complete the restructuring by the end of fiscal 2022.", "Implementation

growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long- term.", "Another

changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings.", "Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices.", "Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin will be influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to", "Our e-commerce

certain core merchandise categories, partially offset by certain ancillary and other businesses, which were negatively impacted by COVID-19 related closures or restrictions; \u2022 SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased three basis points primarily due to leveraging increased sales and partial reversal of a previous year tax assessment.", "During the second half of 2020, we experienced a significant sales shift from certain of our ancillary and other businesses to our core merchandise categories, primarily food and sundries and fresh foods, as a result of COVID-19.",

to increases in fresh foods and softlines, partially offset by a decrease in hardlines.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "Fresh foods gross margin increased as a result of efficiencies from increased sales, partially offset by operating losses from our poultry complex.", "This increase was primarily due to a 32 basis point increase in our core merchandise categories, predominantly fresh foods and food and sundries, partially offset by a decrease in softlines and hardlines.", "These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 14 basis points in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly certain ancillary businesses that were negatively impacted by COVID-19

Competition from Suppliers of Alternative Solutions to Halloysite   When we market halloysite for use in situations where halloysite has not been previously used, or is to be used as an additive in substitution for another additive to enhance certain functionality of an application, we will face competition from suppliers of other solutions and the competition will be based on performance, price and reliability.   Competition for Iron Oxide   We expect to compete with companies that, in some cases, may be larger and better capitalized than us.", "THE COMPANY\u2019S SUCCESS DEPENDS ON OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT   Our senior management has played a critical role in leading the effort to commercialize our halloysite-based products and iron oxides.", "If the Company loses the services of members of senior management, there is no assurance that the Company would be able to attract and retain qualified replacements.", "Before processing, the mineral is crushed.  If only crushing is needed for a particular product, our production capacity will be significantly higher.", "In October 2017 we entered into a Purchase and Supply Agreement with BASF under which BASF, among other things, agreed to provide the Company with up to 15,000 tons of water-based processing capacity.", "During the fourth calendar quarter of 2019, BASF informed us of its intention to terminate its obligations under the Purchase and Supply Agreement.", "We believe the physical plant and equipment utilized at the Dragon Mine are in satisfactory condition to continue our current mining and processing activity except where the Company anticipates using a third party to beneficiate its halloysite.", "The Company continually reviews the adequacy of its physical plant and equipment inventory and expects to invest accordingly to ensure that the size and quality of its physical plant and equipment can meet its needs.", "Currently, our physical plant includes, but is not limited to, two processing mills, a dry house, a site office, a general storage facility, an equipment repair facility, and a structure housing three IR compressors, which are used to power the mill and certain drilling equipment used underground.", "Our mining equipment includes, but is not limited to, a road header, an underground drill, a deep drill, a skid steer, a front-end loader and a number of other pieces traditionally used to mine underground.", "We are a vertically integrated operation focused on developing grades of DRAGONITE and AMIRON that can be utilized for both traditional and advanced end-market applications.", "Many countries around the world have imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus and have closed non-essential businesses.", "Such events may result in a period of business, supply and product manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "In response to COVID-19, the Company implemented remote working and thus far, has not experienced a significant disruption or delay in our operations", "QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK", "Many countries around the world have imposed quarantines and restrictions on travel and mass gatherings to slow the spread of the virus and have closed non-essential businesses.", "Such events may result in a period of business, supply and product manufacturing disruption, and in reduced operations, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "In response to COVID-19, the Company implemented remote working and thus far, has not experienced a significant disruption or delay in our operations.", "The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and market-specific or other relevant assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances.", "Actual results could differ from such estimates or assumptions.   As of December 31, 2020, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business going forward depends on numerous dynamic factors which we cannot reliably predict.", "In most situations, transfer of control is considered complete when the products have been shipped to the customer.", "Such estimates are by their nature imprecise and can be expected to be revised over time because of changes in government regulations, operations, technology, and inflation.", "Our principal executive and financial officers supervised and participated in the evaluation.", "Identification of Directors and Officers   The following table provides the names, positions, ages and principal occupations of our current directors, and our executive officers.", "All courses have been presented to state accounting societies.", "A copy of our Code of Conduct and Ethics is posted on our website at www.appliedminerals.com and can be obtained at no cost by mail at: Applied Minerals, Inc., PO Box 432 Eureka, UT 846289.", "The Nomination Process The general criteria that our Board uses to select nominees includes the following: reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards; demonstrated business acumen, experience, and ability to exercise sound judgments in matters that relate to the current and long-term objectives of the Company; willingness and ability to contribute positively to the decision-making process of the Company; commitment to understand the Company, its risk factors and its industry and to regularly attend and participate in meetings of the Board and its committees; interest and ability to understand the sometimes conflicting interests of the various constituencies of the Company, which include stockholders, employees, customers, creditors and the general public; ability to act in the interests of all stakeholders; and the absence of any appearance of a conflict of interest that would impair the nominee's ability to represent the interests of all of the Company\u2019s stockholders and to fulfill the responsibilities of a director.", "The Board will consider director candidates recommended by our stockholders.

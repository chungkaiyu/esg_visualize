issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity  problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry  consolidation, or strong demand for those parts.", "Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our  suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within

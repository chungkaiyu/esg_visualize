Standing Together  to Advance Humanity 
2020 was a year unlike any other. Despite all the  challenges, together, we grew stronger. True to our  KLA values, we never gave up on our drive to be  better at work and in our communities.  
When COVID-19 disrupted our normal operations,  our top priority was keeping our employees and  their families safe, especially those whose jobs  could only be done onsite. Our teams mobilized  quickly to implement temperature checks and daily  testing for essential staff.   
As communities struggled to secure personal  protective equipment (PPE), we jumped into action  to help. For example, our global operations team  repurposed our 3D printers to produce face shields  for healthcare workers, and our procurement  department helped the Valley Medical Foundation  in San Jose, California, procure more than  300,000  in PPE supplies, with the KLA Foundation donating   100,000 in support of the effort. 
When racial injustice ignited unrest within the  United States and abroad, we stood strong in our  commitment to racial equity. We listened carefully,  had deep conversations and reaffirmed our pledge  that no form of racism will be tolerated at KLA.  
Throughout it all, we forged ahead on our  environmental, social and governance (ESG)  journey. We leaned into business and societal  challenges by helping develop the technology to  address them and continuing the important work  of the KLA Foundation.  
We re proud of the work we did to develop our  corporate ESG strategy during 2019 and 2020, and  we are excited to report progress on our initiatives. 
We remain even more committed to our purpose  of advancing humanity in everything we do  through innovation, stewardship, opportunity  and leadership. True to the KLA name, we ll Keep  Looking Ahead  and working toward a world that s  more just, more equitable and more sustainable.

Our ESG Strategy 
Our ESG activities are an integral part of our  mission to advance humanity through devices  and ideas that transform our future and shape  our world. Our ESG strategy serves as a roadmap  to get us there informing our decisions, holding  us accountable for progress within our business  and our communities, and helping our customers  achieve their own ESG goals.  
Our corporate citizenship journey began when  we opened our doors in 1976 and has always  been an important part of our work. Today, we re  expanding our efforts to be more holistic across  the ESG topics most relevant to our business and  broadening our reporting to be more inclusive  of our global footprint and recently acquired  companies. Looking ahead, we are building  out our long-term ESG strategy with an eye  toward reducing our climate impact, increasing  disclosure and deepening the positive impact  we deliver through our business and community  engagement.  
In 2019, we conducted a materiality assessment  to identify and prioritize our ESG activities. To  further that work in 2020, we partnered with a  third-party consultant to update and broaden the  assessment. We engaged our employees through a  companywide survey and focus group discussions,  our executive team and investors through  interviews, and our peers and industry leaders  through benchmarking. Collecting the perspectives  from a range of KLA stakeholders helped us  discover insights we used to develop a robust ESG  strategy that takes on our biggest opportunities  
and addresses areas of risk, such as operating in a  carbon-constrained world. Please see the results  of our 2020 assessment in the matrix below.  
In 2020, we formed an ESG Steering Committee  composed of KLA executives who oversee our  strategy under the guidance of our Board of  Directors. The Steering Committee was highly

A Letter From Our CEO 
Making an impact that contributes to advancing  humanity has long been a part of the KLA  DNA. This is the North Star strategy we apply  to how we innovate and deliver for customers,  invest in our employees and contribute to the  communities where we work and live. It is with  that foundation that I am pleased to share  with you this year s KLA Global Impact Report.  Summarizing the progress we have made  across 2019 and 2020, this report is proof of the  perseverance and drive to be better that has  been at the core of our efforts through some of  the most unprecedented times we have seen.  
This year s report is different for us. We took the  time to evaluate and understand the priorities  of our stakeholders to allow us to prioritize our  environmental, social and governance objectives  to focus on for 2020 and beyond. This year, for the  first time, we are reporting KLA s Scope 1, Scope 2  and Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This  accomplishment acknowledges the closing and  integration of our Orbotech acquisition over the  past two years. With this acquisition we increased  our employee count by 40% and our global  facilities footprint by 40%. Through our work over  the past year we can now share integrated metrics  and progress against our global impact objectives.  Bringing these companies together also gives us  the opportunity to achieve greater global impact in  the years to come.  
In 2020 we formalized and declared our  commitment to inclusion and diversity, a strategy  grounded in our values that allowed us to come  together when issues of social justice arose  worldwide. We recognize that KLA has a long  journey ahead, but we know we have charted  the right path and collectively we all are working  together to make KLA even better and more  inclusive. We remain resolute in our commitment  to building inclusion in the workplace and to  doing our part to extend this commitment to the  communities where we live through the activities  of the KLA Foundation.  
We will all look back at 2020 as a year like no  other. The global pandemic delivered tremendous  hardship and loss with no boundaries, and the  full impact is still unknown. Through this journey,  we learned a lot and continue to identify best  practices to keep in place as we evolve how we  work. We know that our future will continue to  prioritize health and safety while finding the right  way to retain our productivity and continue our  delivery of leading innovation. None of this would  have been possible without the KLA global teams  who continue to impress and grow in ways we  never expected.  
I am proud of the progress you will find in the  pages of this report and excited at the platform  this is giving us to continue to make great impact  in all we do to advance humanity.

In 2020  KLA committed 
Our customers are constantly challenged to increase their production yield, reduce waste  and meet their own profitability and sustainability goals. KLA solutions make this possible by  allowing manufacturers to innovate and produce chips faster, more sustainably and at a lower  cost. Chips that are smaller and more efficient in energy use have longer battery life, make  data centers more efficient and lead to advancements in sustainable products, such as hybrid  and electric cars. 
By implementing high-quality inspection and metrology systems, faster cycles of learning  and optimal process control sampling, semiconductor manufacturers can improve their  environmental performance. 
For example, if a chip manufacturer achieves an 80% yield, then to deliver 1 million chips  to their customer, they must attempt to make 1,250,000 chips. But if their yield is only 20%  (which can be typical in the early stages of the process), the manufacturer would have to start  with 5 million parts. That means 4 million parts are going to waste and electronic waste  is hazardous and difficult to dispose of. Fortunately, KLA s solutions can help companies  dramatically reduce that waste and lower their total cost of ownership. 
Because our process-control and process-enabling solutions have long lifecycles, KLA products  that are generations old can often be upgraded with evolving technology so customers can  keep the equipment in use, reduce waste and get the most from our latest developments.

 The semiconductor manufacturing  process involves up to 1000 steps. Every  single step involves process tools and  a tremendous amount of materials.  If something goes wrong at any of  these steps and the chips don t meet  the quality standards, they have to  be scrapped. KLA s solutions can help  prevent this waste.  
Rob Cappel Senior Director, Market Research and Analytics 
Helping Fabs Make Greener Choices 
Fabs are reducing process excursions by adding inspection and metrology steps. Earlier  detection of process excursions results in faster time-to-corrective action and significantly less  yield loss and material wasted. The example below shows an excursion happening at process  step two, and demonstrates the environmental savings associated with finding that excursion by  inspecting at process step three as opposed to waiting until process step five.

Backed by Research, We Turn  Customer Goals into Reality 
Research and development make innovation  possible at KLA, and we continuously search for  ways to support our customers as they work  toward their environmental goals. For example,  we ve invested in research to help customers  reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  
In one study, we found that manufacturers can  reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase  throughput in the wafer cleaning process by using  three wafers in between cleans rather than one.  The study looked at the cleaning process for silicon  wafers and silicon nitride wafers. Results show  that by using silicon wafers, manufacturers can  decrease greenhouse gas by 38% and achieve a 9%  higher throughput. By using silicon nitride wafers,  greenhouse gas emissions went down by 51% and  throughput increased by 15%.   
How Increased Manufacturing Efficiency  Reduces Environmental Impact 
When printed circuit boards are manufactured, the imaging process is used to make the  circuit traces on the board. Traditional contact exposure systems use multiple steps to get  from computer-aided manufacturing design to the printed product, requiring the use of film,  chemicals, masks, cooling water and yellow room floor space. Our Orbotech direct imaging  solutions, however, go straight from design to finished product by using highly-focused laser  beams to print traces on the board. 
We examined the data from one of our quick-turn assembly customers to determine how  switching from traditional systems to our direct imaging solution affected environmental impact.  We found that by making the switch, we helped our customers: 
     Reduce pollution (fewer films, chemicals and masks) 
     Lower water consumption 
     Reduce required yellow room floor space

In 2019, KLA became the first semiconductor equipment company to be accepted  as an associate member of the Automotive Electronics Council. The council sets  qualification standards for electronic components in the automotive industry. As  a member, KLA works collaboratively with the automotive industry to develop  Zero Defect strategies that improve automotive reliability.  
Self-Driving Cars 
For self-driving cars, positional accuracy can mean  the difference between a smooth ride and a serious  accident. The 5G communication technologies  used in self-driving vehicles will rely on the same  radio frequency technology used in smartphones.  KLA has been at the heart of that technology  since the late 1990s, supplying etch, chemical  vapor deposition and physical vapor deposition  equipment to radio frequency leaders such as  Qorvo, Skyworks and WIN Semiconductor.   
Autonomous vehicles will also generate huge  amounts of data from hundreds of sensors inside  the vehicle. Our process chambers are used by  manufacturers of micro-electronmechanical  systems (MEMS) to develop high-resolution  gyroscopes that help detect acceleration and  rotation in cars to ensure a safe journey. 
MEMS microphones are also used inside self- driving cars for voice control, as well as listening for  engine noises or emergency vehicles approaching.  Manufacturers use our etch equipment to produce  these types of microphones. 
Innovating for  a More Sustainable  Business 
The Continuous Improvement Program  at SPTS shows just how multidimensional  innovation is across KLA. For the past  seven years, SPTS has showcased the best  of its employee-led projects at its annual  Continuous Improvement Day. Projects  focus on improving work practices or  products that contribute to the sustainability  of the business and or demonstrate return  on investment. Winning projects from 2020  achieved  1.2 million in savings, and to date,  the various projects have saved SPTS over   6 million.

Our Security Efforts Are Paying Off 
Advancing innovation requires protecting our systems and intellectual property at every level of our  organization. We re proud of the progress we ve made in keeping sensitive information safe at KLA. We aim  to ensure that the technologies we use to secure our environment are up, operational and running at a  greater than 99% average. 
Reducing Risk Keeps Us Moving  Forward 
From establishing clear policies to educating our  employees, we re putting measures in place to  continually address the threat of cyberattacks and  intellectual property breaches so we can continue  to develop solutions that make a difference.  
Empowering Employees To Do  the Right Thing 
We educate our employees on the importance of  protecting sensitive data from their first days on  the job, and in 2020, we strengthened our stance  against potential internal security threats. We re  also educating senior staff on some of the riskiest  security topics from the basics of ransomware to  protecting sensitive customer information. 
Safeguarding  Intellectual Property  is Everyone's  Responsibility  
Every day, our employees handle something  valuable: the company's intellectual  property or the intellectual property of  our customers and partners that has been  entrusted to us. This includes not only  patents but also knowledge, ideas, plans  and information that combine to form  intellectual property.  
Every KLA employee is responsible  for protecting company and customer  intellectual property. KLA has developed  need-to-know and data classification systems  to help employees recognize and protect  intellectual property. The need-to-know  campaign aims to get employees to think  more about how and with whom they share  information, while the data classification  system is a visual way to identify and protect  information.

The scale and growth of the technology  sector require a concerted effort to make the  microprocessor manufacturing process more  sustainable. That s why we re creating new products  and services that help companies minimize waste,  conserve natural resources and reduce their  environmental footprint. To learn more about how  we re helping our customers cut down on waste  and meet their own sustainability goals, see our  product innovation section.  
Climate and Energy Waste Water 
Worldwide Growth  and Opportunity 
In addition to our environmental stewardship  efforts on the microprocessor level, we re also  going big on a macro level. The past four years  have brought tremendous growth for KLA. While  that has increased our environmental footprint,  it has also given us a bigger global platform to  create change.  
After acquiring seven new sites in 2019 and  2020, we reset our environmental baselines and  approach to global environmental management.  We ve integrated the best practices from our  SPTS and Orbotech acquisitions into regional  and global programs that will help us amplify  our positive impacts. This comprehensive  understanding of our integrated business will  guide our climate goal-setting efforts, and we  
SPTS is ISO 14001 certified, which means it meets international requirements for an effective  environmental management system. KLA was certified in 2003.  
Our product teams and business groups  around the world are working hard to uncover  opportunities, tackle challenges and push our  ESG strategy forward. We ve brought together  critical stakeholders with a third-party consulting  group to guide us in creating and updating  our strategy. And we re working across our  value chain to make a collective impact. This  includes engaging our supply chain partners  and implementing Responsible Business Alliance  (RBA) Code of Conduct requirements.  
We ll continue our efforts to care for our earth  focusing on the areas that will have the greatest  impact. By minimizing our climate footprint,  reducing materials and waste, and managing our  water usage, we can shape a more sustainable  future.

Climate and Energy 
Steps to a  Smaller Footprint 
We re gaining momentum as we work across our global sites to procure renewable energy to power  our operations. For example, in 2020 our Wales site purchased approximately 97% of its electricity from  carbon-free sources (wind, solar, hydro and thermal). This work will continue to accelerate as we set a GHG  emission goal in the coming year. 
At our Milpitas headquarters, we have been purchasing 100% of our electricity from carbon-free sources  since 2018 from a combination of renewable sources and hydropower. Also, the conversion of our  existing plant to cryogenic nitrogen in 2018 has resulted in 294 fewer metric tons of CO  equivalent (CO e)  annually and eliminated indirect emissions from fuel deliveries by truck. We re exploring other next- generation technologies as well, such as the use of solar photovoltaics and fuel cells at our facilities. 
At KLA Israel, we reduced electricity consumption by 3% in 2019 by changing to LED lamps and applying  Blygold  coating to chillers.  
We also consider sustainability as a key factor in the construction of new facilities. In 2020, we completed  construction of a new building in Milpitas that we designed using best-practice standards for healthy,  highly efficient and cost-effective building design. In 2019, KLA began construction of our second North  American headquarters campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The sustainable design features of our new  campus include underground parking to minimize the building footprint as well as a green roof, which will  not only purify and oxygenate the air but will also insulate the building, helping reduce energy demands. 
Spotlight: Energy Improvements in Belgium 
In an ongoing effort to curb the impacts of climate change, our Belgium office contracted for  100% green energy and installed solar panels on the roof in 2020. We now track the amount of  power generated as well as our CO2 reduction at that site. The accumulative emission reduction  last year was the equivalent of planting 123 trees.

GHG Inventory  
In 2021, we expanded the scope of our annual greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory to provide a  full accounting of our corporate GHG emissions. The inventory covered our company-wide  Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions for calendar years 2019 and 2020, in alignment with  the requirements of the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable  Development s GHG Protocol.  
The inventory also accounts for our seven recent acquisitions, significantly expanding our  operational footprint. We ve now established 2019 as our base year against which we will  measure our future GHG emissions. Moving forward, we plan to continue tracking and  quantifying our emissions on a calendar year cycle. 
Scope of our GHG Inventory  
We defined our organizational boundaries for the  Inventory using the Operational Control approach per  the GHG Protocol guidelines. Under this approach, we  accounted for 100% of the GHG emissions from sources  over which we have operational control. This includes 11  KLA "Super Sites," two owned offices, company vehicles  and all equipment operated by KLA. We define a Super  Site as KLA-owned or leased facilities where we conduct  manufacturing or research and development activities,  along with at least one of the following: sales support,  cleanroom or office space. All KLA Super Sites have at  least 25 employees who regularly work onsite.  
Direct emissions from operations owned and controlled  by KLA, including: stationary combustion of natural gas  and diesel  mobile combustion of gasoline, diesel and  liquified petroleum gas  and refrigerants and volatile  organic compounds such as fugitive emissions.  
Indirect emissions from the generation of energy  (i.e., electricity) purchased and consumed by KLA,  including: the consumption of electricity across facilities  from renewable and non-renewable sources. In our  inventory, we calculated Scope 2 electricity emissions  per the GHG Protocol Scope 2 location-based and  market-based methods. 
Relevant indirect emissions we calculated that occur  across our value chain include: purchased goods and  services  capital goods  fuel and energy-related activities   upstream transportation and distribution  waste generated  in operations  business travel  employee commuting   upstream leased assets (i.e., purchased energy use at  leased offices and sales sites)  and use of sold products.

Inventory Results 
The inventory shows that our Scope 3 emissions are the largest contributor to our total carbon footprint. Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions contribute  less than 1% of the total Scope 1, 2, 3 impact. From 2019 to 2020, we saw a small increase in our Scope 1 emissions due to an increase in natural gas use  and the availability of higher-quality refrigerant use data. We saw a decrease in our Scope 2 emissions from the use of more carbon-free sources of energy  and a continued focus on improving the efficiency of our operations. 
The use of sold products is our largest Scope 3 emission source. The increase in Scope 3 emissions between 2019 2020 is due largely to increased product  sales, spend on purchased goods and services and product transportation. Across our portfolio, we build KLA products to last   the average lifespan of a  KLA product is over 20 years in operation. To calculate their impact, we estimate energy used during their full use-life, contributing to the magnitude of the  number.  
KLA products save our customers materials, energy and waste by increasing their yields. With ever-higher resolution inspection capability, KLA products are  also enabling the creation of next-generation chips capable of greater computational efficiency and performance. As we continue our sustainability efforts,  KLA is committed to working with our partners across the value chain to increase efficiency and reduce our climate impact.

Materials and Waste 
Maximum Effort  for Minimum  Waste 
In a global company, many small changes can  make a big impact. Each of our locations has  individual targets for reducing waste that, when  added together, help us achieve our company- wide ambitions. For example, in our Wales site,  we achieved 100% waste diversion. In Milpitas, we  set a goal of 83% waste diversion, and in 2020, we  exceeded our target with an 88% diversion rate.  In Singapore, our goal was a 75% reduction, which  we achieved in both 2019 and 2020. In Israel, we  achieved our goal of reducing solid waste by 5% in  2020 (compared to 2018). 
We re working diligently across our organization  to remove plastic from our waste stream, and  we have realized significant gains through cross- departmental collaboration. In 2019, we worked  with our engineering group to create alternative  packaging architectures for shipping spare parts  safely around the world. This reduced our total  packaging materials, specifically polyurethane,  by 75%. Furthermore, these solutions allow us to  attach all materials without cross-contamination,  which results in easier recycling.  
Our employees also play an important role in  achieving our goals to reduce waste, and thanks  to our idea-sharing platform, they've been the  catalyst for several new programs. For example,  employees at Orbotech in Israel are working to  reduce the use of disposable cups. And at our  Singapore and Wales sites, we implemented a  Reuse to Reduce program in 2019 to eliminate  single-use plastic. We gave staff reusable water  bottles and replaced single-use water bottles with  water jugs and glasses for meetings.  
Giving Old Crates  New Life 
With our Reuse, Refurbish and Recycle  program, all crates coming into KLA are  not only sourced from raw wood materials  that comply with established sustainability  programs,  they are also diverted from  landfills and instead redirected to reuse or  recycling.  
In the United States, we reused 49%  of crates in 2019 and 57% in 2020. In  Singapore, over that same time frame, our  crate reuse rate averaged 30%.    
  Forest Stewardship Council  (FSC ), Sustainable  Forestry Initiative  (SFI ) and the Program for the  Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) standards.  These certifications ensure the wood utilized is  harvested legally, and that forests are managed while  maintaining biodiversity.

Water Management 
Making Every  Drop Count 
KLA operates in several regions where water is  scarce, so we re extremely conscious of our water  footprint. We track our usage, strive to source  more recycled water and less freshwater, and  work to keep contaminants out of the storm drain  and ground. 
We ve implemented programs to reduce our  freshwater use and engage employees in water  conservation efforts. This includes environmental  
management training for employees and  contractors, as well as improvements in campus  landscaping management. For example, we  use NEWater in Singapore for irrigation on  our grounds as well as in our cooling towers  returning water to our watersheds. In Milpitas, we  use high-quality reclaimed water, which has been  purified by the Santa Clara Valley Water District  Silicon Valley Advanced Water Purification Center.  While these programs help us reduce freshwater  use, we saw a 20% increase in freshwater  consumption at our Milpitas facilities in 2019 due  to an addition of a large cleanroom, increased  evaporation on our cooling towers and a larger  employee population.  
As we continue to expand our operations, we  will maintain our efforts to conserve water by  increasing the efficiency of our operations.  
Water Wise in Israel 
Our Orbotech site implemented a fresh- water reduction program with multiple  initiatives inside and out: 
   Purchasing low-flow toilets 
   Using AC condensation  water for irrigation 
   Planting water-wise plants 
   Redesigning irrigation  systems and watering lines 
   Reducing water vaporization  by replacing some garden  areas with volcanic stones

Opportunity  Begins with  Inclusion and  Diversity 
In 2020, the KLA team made an intentional  decision to put inclusion first in how we frame   inclusion and diversity  to emphasize the  importance of belonging as the foundation of  attracting and retaining diverse talent. Inclusion  puts the diversity of our employees into context. 
 At KLA, inclusion is inherent in everyone s job  description,  says Sandra Mahadwar, Chief Inclusion  and Diversity Officer.  Mindful inclusion expresses  to team members that their diverse backgrounds,  experiences and viewpoints are an indispensable  part of problem-solving and innovation.    
When our colleagues help us think differently, we  create a more engaging environment that invigorates  creativity, enriches learning and improves business  outcomes. We strive to attract the best talent  around the globe, not limiting ourselves to certain  demographics, universities or geographies.  
New Ideas, New Momentum 
To deepen our commitment to inclusion and diversity, we implemented a more formal and programmatic  approach. We continued our work through the pandemic and accelerated employee education and  awareness as civil unrest emerged in several of our global locations. Our efforts started at the top with  our CEO, Rick Wallace, who sent videos and emails to all employees discussing our drive to be better  and affirming the company s commitment to inclusion and diversity as well as a zero-tolerance policy  for racism, intolerance and harassment. He challenged us to work toward understanding our biases and  creating a culture where inclusion and diversity are core to who we are and our success as a business.  
In 2020, we added an inclusion and diversity page to our website, publishing our diversity numbers for  the first time. Internally, we launched several programs to nurture our talent and create a strong sense  of belonging for everyone. We ve also made inclusion and diversity a key element of the KLA Foundation,  which supports traditionally underserved and marginalized communities. In support of the movement  against racism in the summer of 2020, the Foundation committed to social justice with the creation of the  KLA Social Equity Fund and a  1 million commitment to combat racial inequity.

Creating Space for All Voices  
We re committed to taking a stand for social equity  creating space to hear, understand and address any concerns in our company  and leading change by example.  In 2020, we brought in a facilitator to lead a social justice discussion where we talked about unconscious bias and created an environment where underrepresented  employees could share their experiences.  
To strengthen our culture of inclusion, we are continuing to increase the number of employee resource groups (ERGs) at our sites. These are voluntary groups of  employees who have a common interest in helping KLA achieve its inclusion and diversity goals. ERGs are a fundamental part of our inclusion and diversity strategy.  They give colleagues an opportunity to come together to share openly, promote and elevate awareness on important issues, and help the company gain a better  understanding of what it needs to do to be more inclusive and diverse.

Inclusive From the Start in Ann Arbor 
Building a new second headquarters gave us the opportunity to prioritize inclusion and diversity from the beginning when hiring our new staff. Since opening our  Ann Arbor office in 2019, we ve achieved 50% women in site leadership roles (director and above) and almost a third (29%) of our employees overall are women.   
Our Mosaic ERG originated at our Ann Arbor site and the group sponsors a variety of inclusion and diversity activities. For example, we invited a state senator and  community leader in Detroit to engage us in conversation around issues within the the Black African American community. We also celebrated Pride month by  watching  The Imitation Game,  followed by a facilitated discussion on the diversity issues it surfaced, such as LGBTQ , disabilities and women s empowerment,  and how these issues continue to impact people today. 
The work we ve done in Ann Arbor is now being used as a pilot for how we can improve our hiring and retention processes to be more inclusive across all KLA locations.

Health and Safety 
Keeping our  People and  Workplaces Safe 
Our employees are the lifeblood of our business.  That s why their health and safety are always our  priority. 
To ensure our employees felt safe coming to  work during the pandemic, our health and safety,  facilities and security teams joined forces to  establish a gold standard for site operations. This  allowed us to keep production facilities running,  which in turn, enabled KLA to keep delivering new  products and servicing customer sites during a  period of exceptionally high demand.  
Rick Wallace, our CEO, began weekly emails and  videos during COVID-19 to provide updates on the  steps KLA was taking to keep them safe, always  reinforcing that the number one priority is the  well-being of our employees and their families.  
 I know it s been really hard work,  but thank you the only places I feel safe  are at home and onsite at work.   Between 2019 and 2020, KLA employees completed more than 10,000 hours of  training on health and safety topics.

Quality Health and Safety Training  
All new hires are required to go through a health and safety training program. In addition, our service  technicians are required to achieve and maintain level 3 safety training certification. This training program  continued uninterrupted during COVID-19 when our team worked quickly to move all courses online. 
For the past 14 years, KLA has been a member of Training Magazine s Top 10 Hall of Fame, which recognizes us  as a company unsurpassed in harnessing human capital. Our Wales site (SPTS) has received the Royal Society  for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) Occupational Health and Safety Gold Award for eight consecutive years.

Consistently Low Injury Rates  
Our excellent safety record is a tribute to our employees' efforts, our training programs and our safety policy  management. We employ a full-time ergonomist to advance safety and human engineering for our products,  and safe, user-friendly work methods and environments for our employees. As a result of these efforts, we  achieved ISO 45001 certification in the United Kingdom and excellent OSHA statistics in the United States.   
Our goal is always zero accidents across our facilities, and to achieve that, we conduct proactive risk  assessments and audits to improve loss control measures. We also require all employees to complete a global  injury and illness prevention program based on risk and hazard assessments.  
Because of the rapid growth we ve experienced over the past few years, we completed a baseline assessment  in 2020, looking at applicable local and government safety requirements for each new site. The goal was to  understand the maturity of each of our acquired companies  health and safety programs and then create a  global environment, health and safety management system that integrates ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 into a  single management system. 
With a framework of plan, do, act, repeat, the assessment helped us respond quickly when COVID-19 hit and  adopt best practices for each of our sites. We implemented mandatory face coverings, COVID-19 testing,  proactive cleaning and sanitization, division of individuals and work shifts to prevent cross-contamination,  installation of screens and protective infrastructures, and increased fresh air ventilation.

Employee Well-Being 
Healthy  Employees  are Happy  Employees 
Faced with everything from wildfires to quarantines to community lockdowns, the events of 2020  reaffirmed our commitment to employee wellness. We adapted many of our existing programs and  quickly developed new ones to ensure that employees felt supported and at ease. In 2020, our employee  support initiatives included: 
The COVID-19 pandemic was especially hard on working parents, and according to a 2020 McKinsey  report, mothers bore the brunt of it. To ease this burden, we offered remote learning and childcare leave  for employees in the U.S. and some of our other locations, giving them extra time to help their kids learn  from home and providing financial support for any tutoring and childcare they might need. We also  offered online wellness classes and gave employees an online forum the KLA Caring for Families site  so they could get together to swap stories or even just talk about coping during COVID-19.  
   Offering hotel accommodations when employees were impacted by wildfires in California and  Oregon.  
   Expanding employee assistance programs and increased health, mental and financial-focused  wellness sessions in most of our international locations during COVID-19. 
   Providing up to 10 days paid leave for employees in our U.S. and India offices who were sick or  caring for sick loved ones. 
   Giving our employees in some locations a quarterly well-being payment to use on anything  health-related and making check-in calls to all employees working from home.

Health and wellness  Online and Off 
Prior to COVID-19, we invested in opportunities for employees to get involved in their own health, become more active, participate in community events and lead healthy  lifestyles. We moved much of these programs online in 2020.   
One such opportunity is our Virgin Pulse wellness program. It allows employees to manage and improve their health in fun and engaging ways, helping to establish  lifelong healthy habits. We subsidize the cost of fitness trackers, which can be connected to an app to track their progress and activity. 
Virgin Pulse Wellness Program 
Another wellness opportunity we offer is our Smart Path program, which  provides a fitness assessment and basic workout programs for all members.  Our fitness team in the U.S. offers a range of group fitness classes, monthly  fitness challenges with themes and prizes, personal trainers for one-on-one  coaching and nutrition tips. During COVID-19, these all went virtual, making  them even more accessible to all KLA employees. 
For our SPTS employees in Wales, we provided remote fitness classes via Zoom  and recorded them so they could be accessed from anywhere at any time.

Community Engagement 
Caring for the  Communities Where  We Work and Live 
The past two years have demonstrated that when we  come together, we can do our part to address complex  social issues in meaningful ways whether it s staying  safe during a global pandemic or working toward  equity in opportunity for all. 
In 2020, we provided  2 million in global COVID-19  relief funds through the KLA Foundation, focusing on  the most vulnerable members of our communities.  We awarded grants to programs that offer community  services, education, critical medical supplies and  resources to combat food insecurity. In June, we  announced the dedication of  1 million to national and  local initiatives addressing systemic racial inequities.

A Foundation for Sustainable Change 
The KLA Foundation is committed to advancing humanity by investing in our communities to  create a more equitable, inclusive and accessible world. We believe making an impact requires  listening, ongoing collaboration, patience and a holistic understanding of human needs. The  KLA Foundation strategically partners with organizations that know their communities best to  create upstream solutions for sustainable change and empower our employees to get involved in  causes that are close to their hearts. 
The Foundation focuses on three critical areas: education, health and wellness, and community  enrichment. As we evaluate nonprofit partnerships, we look at their diversity, equity and  inclusion efforts and how they align with our inclusion and diversity commitments. 
Our Approach  
We drive an employee giving culture by providing tools and support to enable employees to lead,  participate in and contribute to community projects in order to maximize the impact of their  engagement in the communities where they work and live. 
Create opportunities and increase long-term access to educational resources.  Support girls and underrepresented communities throughout their unique  educational journeys, especially in STEM fields. 
Promote community wellness programs and partner with grassroots organizations  dedicated to achieving health equity.  
Community Enhancement 
Nurture strategic partnerships with organizations that deeply understand their  community s needs to support grassroots efforts and encourage positive long- term change.

Our social justice initiative takes a holistic approach  to dismantling systemic racial inequities, working  from the top down through large-scale initiatives,  and from the bottom up through grassroots  organizations that can respond immediately to the  impacted community s needs.   
 Over the past year, aligning our programs to  help address the racial equity gap has been a  big initiative,  says Cindy Campbell, Executive  Director, KLA Foundation.  We create collaborative  partnerships with organizations focusing on  addressing equity gaps so everyone has access to  opportunities that will make them successful.   
As part of this commitment to racial equity, the  KLA Foundation launched the Social Equity Fund in  collaboration with the American Heart Association.  This three-year,  1.5 million fund aims to address  systemic issues facing communities of color  in Silicon Valley and Metro Detroit, where our  global headquarters and second North American  headquarters are located. 
 The potential to make an impact is  incredible and we are honored to be  recipients. As valuable as the grant is,  I am equally pleased to have a team of  people who truly care about us and  the project. They are invested and are  rooting for our collective success.

Strategic Global Community Initiative 
To inspire and empower young girls interested in STEM education, KLA Taiwan hosted a three-day science  camp in partnership with National Tsing Hua University. KLA Korea also sponsored similar education  programs to support the welfare of middle-and high-school girls in partnership with Duksung Women s  University.  I think this camp enlightens our next female generation on the fundamental spirit of science.    KLA volunteer  
In 2019, the KLA Foundation hosted its first RoboGames, a collaboration between KLA-sponsored  robotics teams and FIRST  Robotics, which brought nine high-school robotics teams to Milpitas for a  demonstration. In 2020, we continued the RoboGames in a virtual format to keep all participants engaged  and safe during the pandemic. The KLA Foundation also supports an all-girls robotics team in Korea. 
In 2020, we provided funding for the Agastya Women s Program in India to set up and operate a mobile  science laboratory for children. Because COVID-19 prohibited social gatherings, the program pivoted to  digital summer camps with activities to help kids explore science topics ranging from chemistry to pollution  to nuclear physics. 
We also provided seed funding to Bay Area Tutoring Association for their COVID-19 Tutoring Pods, which  provided tutoring services for children of Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) healthcare workers.   
 KLA Foundation s partnership has helped Bay Area Tutoring Association be intentional  with social justice initiatives during COVID-19, like locating students of African ancestry  in the Bay Area whose parents are essential workers. This partnership during COVID-19  has been beneficial for students who need an approach to education that the  traditional public-school education doesn t provide.

Detroit, Michigan: Food insecurity impacts families all over the world, including in our own community of Detroit, where 48% of residents are food insecure. To  help address all aspects of food insecurity from healthcare to farming and distribution the KLA Foundation fosters synergistic partnerships with Peaches and  Greens, DLIVE (Detroit Life is Valuable Everyday) and Keep Growing Detroit. 
India: KLA India established a close partnership with Aid to India to support the surrounding Chennai villages during COVID-19. The KLA Foundation sponsored  a local village health worker to identify and monitor the health and nutritional needs for pregnant women and the elderly in the village. We contributed funds to  purchase saplings and seeds to cultivate and produce vegetables in the community, provided locally prepared nutritional snacks to the children, and distributed  health and nutrition supplies to 10 families for a year. 
Israel: We also partnered with Amcha Israel, which promotes the mental and social well-being of Holocaust survivors. We helped Amcha to purchase laptop  computers for 70 elderly citizens to alleviate the loneliness they experienced during COVID-19 lockdowns. The systems allow users to connect to a variety of online  activities via Zoom, including lectures, sports, entertainment and more.  
Community Enrichment  
The events of 2020 highlighted the importance of supporting the communities in which we live and work. We divided our  2 million global COVID-19 relief funds  into two phases for granting: 1) immediate support for the most vulnerable communities and 2) a recovery phase to assist organizations impacted by shutdowns. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, when hospitals were desperate to find critical medical supplies, we used our 3D printing lab to make face shields for medical  workers. In addition, our procurement staff volunteered their time to help the Valley Medical Center source and purchase critical medical equipment from N95  masks to isolation gowns to medical carts. In total, KLA contributed  500,000 to the effort. 
The KLA Foundation also works to meet the immediate needs of people who have survived natural disasters and tragic events in our communities. In addition to  our COVID-19 Relief Fund, we sponsored disaster relief efforts for the California and Australian wildfires and the mass shooting in Gilroy, California.

Empowering our People to Volunteer  Our 2019 impact Our 2020 impact 
We offer KLA employees various opportunities  to contribute their time, talents and money to  organizations they re passionate about. Through  our Dollars for Doers program, employees can  earn  10 in donation credits for every hour they  volunteer. We also provide donation matching  funds to increase the impact of each employee s  donations. In 2020, we raised the donating  match limit for each employee from  5,000 to   10,000 annually.  
While many volunteer opportunities come through  the Foundation with organized events such as  our Day of Service and American Heart Association  Heart Walk employees can volunteer at any  nonprofit they choose and qualify for the donation  credit. Our global giving program makes it easy to  find volunteer opportunities, log volunteer hours  and request matching funds and donation credits. 
Unfortunately, COVID-19 forced many of our  nonprofit partner organizations to put in-person  programs on hold, which reduced company- organized volunteer opportunities in 2020. To  ease the burden our nonprofit partners faced  due to the pandemic, we provided support and  flexibility to these organizations to help meet  their greatest needs.

Human and Labor Rights 
Our Path to a More Diverse  and Sustainable Supply Chain 
Partnering with  Suppliers Who  Share Our Values 
Our commitment to advancing opportunity  extends to our supply chain. We seek out  suppliers who share our strong values  treat their  employees with dignity, respect and fairness   and meet the strict requirements in our Code of  Conduct to keep our supply chain free from any  human trafficking and labor violations. 
In 2020, the combination of global supply chain  disruptions, our strategic focus on inclusion and  diversity across our business, and the demand  for continuous innovation highlighted the  need and opportunity for a more diverse and  sustainable supply chain one that aligns with  our ESG strategy and supports our commitment  to inclusion and diversity. In response, we  created a three-year strategic plan that will help  us minimize supply chain disruptions and bring  on partners who will help achieve our inclusion  and diversity goals.   
This journey is just beginning. In 2020, we  laid a strong foundation by contracting with  a third-party partner to compare our supplier  lists with public sources that identify and  track diverse supplier categories, such as  women-owned businesses, minority-owned  businesses and others. As a result of this work,  we have increased the number of identified  diverse suppliers already in our supply chain  by 242%. In 2021, we will continue working to  bring our strategic plan to fruition, identifying  goals and metrics, tracking our progress and  enlisting champions in each organization to  help us create even more sustainable, inclusive  and diverse supply chains throughout our  operations. 
The collective impact of industry leaders is  furthering our efforts beyond KLA. In 2019,  we partnered with Intel, Micron and Applied  Materials as an early member of a working  group called the SEMI MOD (Manufacturing  Ownership Diversity). The mission of SEMI MOD  is to promote more diverse supply chains in  semiconductor manufacturing and drive the  inclusion of such businesses. Additionally,  in 2020, KLA became a Corporate Member  of the Western Regional Minority Supplier  Development Council to further expand our  awareness of business opportunities with  certified minority business enterprises.

Protecting the Rights of Every Human 
KLA solutions rely on parts from across a global supply chain. We take great  care to ensure we re acting responsibly and holding our suppliers to the same  human rights and ethical business practice standards we set for ourselves.   
One way we do this is by championing the Responsible Business Alliance  (RBA) Code of Conduct and asking all current and potential suppliers to  review, understand, act in accordance with, and implement its social,  environmental and ethical standards throughout their businesses. We also  adhere to the UK Modern Slavery Act and the California Transparency in  Supply Chains Act.   
When selecting new suppliers, we employ a qualification process that typically  includes supplier visits and or quality audits of their people, processes and  capabilities. We contractually require our suppliers to adhere to our  
We also worked with a third-party firm to create a new compliance portal for suppliers that provides multiple ways to get assistance and training around conflict  minerals. Suppliers can choose the training they want and access a compliance guide. In 2019, we conducted a training webinar for suppliers to detail our  compliance program, operations standards and expectations around substances of very high concern.  
By partnering with our suppliers, maintaining transparency and building trust throughout our supply chain, we can amplify our efforts to create a more just and  humane world. For more information on our human rights efforts in our supply chain, please see our content index.  
Tier 1 Supplier Assessments 
Supply Chain Human Rights policy. Our policy, which is aligned with the RBA  Code of Conduct, covers labor rights, safe and healthy work environments  for employees, adherence to applicable environmental and employment  laws, metals and minerals responsibility, ethical business practices and  more. To fulfill our duty of oversite, we continually assess our suppliers   performance and work with any noncompliant suppliers on identifying and  implementing corrective actions.   
In 2019, we added newly acquired Orbotech and SPTS under the KLA RBA  umbrella. Even with the additional suppliers and obstacles introduced by  the pandemic, we achieved our goal to get 85% of our targeted suppliers to  participate in the annual RBA Facility Supplier Assessment Questionnaire,  which assesses the supplier s compliance to the RBA Code of Conduct.

Talent Development 
Shaping Leaders,  Fulfilling Lives 
We believe that helping employees do their best  work goes beyond strengthening their skills.  That s why we take a holistic approach to talent  development. From coaching and career courses  to family care and bonding leave, we aim to  have our talent programs cover all dimensions  of an employee s life. They re designed to help  employees bring their whole self to work and  enjoy a fulfilling career. 
This is an approach that has served our company  and our employees well, with our global turnover  staying consistently low year-over-year.

We ve made progress, and we know there s still  much to be done. Work group adaptability, work-life  balance and collaboration are all areas we ll continue  striving to improve in the year ahead. 
 In all the years spent at KLA, there are  two things I love most: The opportunity  to work on bleeding-edge technology  with the best and brightest minds in  the industry. And KLA s culture that  encourages new and bold ideas regardless  of one s position in the company.   
Vidya Ramanathan Applications Engineering Manager  
When employees talk,  we listen 
In a year that brought unexpected hardship  and uncertainty, employee engagement was  more important than ever. But even before  2020, we put programs in place to ensure  our employees  voices are always heard.  Through our engagement survey, we gauge  how people are feeling about their work,  whether they have the right skills to do their  jobs, and how we can make KLA better.  
2019 survey highlights: 
   86% of employees participated in  the survey 
   83% believe alignment is key 
   82% of employees have confidence  in senior leadership s decisions  to ensure company success,  exceeding the Global High  Performing Companies benchmark  by 16 points 
   At least 80% of employees perceive  KLA as flexible and a company that  makes changes to stay ahead of  the competition

Cultivating Careers and Opening Doors Through Training Taking teams  to new heights 
Our award-winning Corporate Learning Center and Learning and Knowledge Services every employee from  the moment they enter their first KLA role to the time they leave. To support our mission of accelerating  performance through learning, we provide employees with talent development planning, courses, coaching  and team-building events. 
In addition to group instruction, we provide facilitation and coaching to help employees push themselves  and their teams further.  
And because we do all of our talent development in-house, we keep the knowledge within KLA, providing  even more value to the whole organization. 
We also support continued learning through tuition reimbursement and have worked with some of the  leading universities to create systems engineering programs so we can further develop our highest talent.  For example, we partnered with Stanford University, San Jos  State University and University of Michigan to  develop and offer advanced, customized engineering programs for KLA employees. 
Our Electronics, Packaging and Components group, which includes SPTS and Orbotech, has also made an  impact with their employee development initiatives: 
KLA has been included in the Training Magazine Top 10 Hall of Fame since 2008. 
Our Corporate Learning Center team invests 60 70% of our typical work week in  coaching and facilitation. 
   In 2019, SPTS received the Investors in People Gold Standard, which includes a rigorous assessment  and certification process. SPTS is one of only a few companies in the manufacturing sector to achieve  a Gold Standard. 
   In addition to conducting workshops that help employees develop their personal career goals and  improve leadership skills, Orbotech continued its Electronics, Packaging and Components Innovation  Program. The program not only focuses on technology, products and processes but also offers  employees mentoring opportunities so they can explore possibilities beyond their current role. 
Our talent development initiatives go  beyond helping employees grow as  individuals. We also support entire teams  as they work to carry out our corporate  objectives. In 2020 and 2021, the  Corporate Learning Center has facilitated  several global teams through a framework  to help them define their strategic  direction. Through virtual sessions with  leaders and their broader teams, we  worked with Customer Experience, Global  Workplace Services and Cybersecurity to  help them create their group s mission,  vision and strategies.   
 With our mission, vision  and strategies defined,  we ve been able to  energize and align more  than 400 engineers in  our group during one of  the most challenging and  rewarding years in our  company s history.

Expanding Access  to Employee Learning 
Due to the global pandemic, the Corporate  Learning Center and Learning and Knowledge   Services quickly moved to virtual learning and  augmented reality training. Despite the perceived  constraints, this  borderless  classroom ultimately  helped us reach more students around the world.  In the second quarter of 2020, we taught four  times as many students as the same quarter in the  previous year. Reaching more students provides  a richer mix of attendees who can benefit from  different experiences and backgrounds. 
 By building a true global community,  we re democratizing learning at KLA.  One of our goals is to ensure that every  single employee is able to realize five or  more days of development annually to  meet their needs.  
Glenn Hughes Senior Director of Learning and Development  
Training the Leaders of Tomorrow 
At KLA, we have a strong focus on leadership training. Our Enterprise Leadership Program (ELP),  which spans two years, prepares KLA employees to fill future leadership roles. In 2019, 125 employees  participated in the program. 
As we strive for gender equity, we also place particular emphasis on developing KLA s women leaders. In  2019 and 2020, several of our women employees in the United States participated in Women Unlimited s  programs, which provide mentorship and coaching to develop leadership skills to women advancing into  manager and director-level positions and to women in the early stages of their career. 
Extending Our Community Reach 
When we invest in our young people, we re investing in a brighter future. We help students develop the  skills they need to pursue meaningful careers that make a difference. Through our Urbanek Education  Fund, we award higher education funding to children of KLA employees. 
For more about how KLA supports community efforts to develop technical talent, see our Community  Engagement section. 
Collaborating Across Teams to Improve Communication 
We strive to ensure that our company messages are clearly communicated so employees have all the  information they need to make good decisions. To support that goal, our Corporate Learning Center s  award-winning digital media team partners with the Global Communications team to create compelling  video messages.   
As of 2020, the Urbanek Education Fund has helped more than 350 students with   5.2 million in education grants.

Business Ethics and Compliance 
How We Work  Shows Who We Are 
Working ethically and complying with our legal  obligations have always been central to the way  we conduct business. At KLA, we continuously  strive to create and maintain an ethical and  legally compliant culture where everyone is  aligned around our value systems, policies and  procedures.

Strengthening our  Ethical Culture 
As KLA has grown through acquisitions, new hires,  entering new markets and seizing other new  opportunities, our leaders recognized the need to  evolve our ethics and compliance program. That s  why in 2019, KLA hired our first full-time chief  compliance officer who has built our dedicated  ethics and compliance team.  
We also continued to mature our programs  through the development of a compliance  effectiveness program, which includes assessing  KLA s most significant criminal and regulatory risks  and ensuring that we have effective compliance  programs to prevent, detect and remediate issues  as they arise.  
In addition, we conducted several internal and  external reviews of certain programs, such as  our trade compliance and privacy programs, and  identified opportunities to further enhance and  mature our initiatives. We ve also refined our  training offerings to ensure that our employees  know what s expected of them. In recent years, we: 
We value feedback from our employees on these  efforts, and, in 2020, we partnered with Ethisphere  to deliver a global Ethical Culture Assessment to  discover how employees view our program and  where we can improve.  
   Rolled out a new standards of business  conduct web-based training course 
   Developed and delivered more targeted and  role-based training 
   Created a multi-year, risk-based training program   
The assessment measured eight key areas, including: awareness of our business ethics and compliance  program, perception of our function, reporting misconduct, pressure to compromise standards,  organizational justice, and perception of supervisors, leadership, co-workers and the work environment.  Here s what we found:

Taking the Next Step with Values in Action 
Our Values in Action program is an innovative standards of business conduct training program that  incorporates internal and external instructors, interactive exercises, discussions and polling questions  and involves about 10 hours of in-depth training. Values in Action covers 10 subject areas such as the  importance of speaking up, anti-bribery and corruption, trade compliance, privacy, and inclusion and  diversity. Based on our five core values, the new program launched in 2021 to more than 1100 senior  managers and higher and will be rolling out to the broader employee base in our next phase. 
Not only will the Values in Action program propel our ethics and compliance efforts forward, but it will also  get employees talking about these important issues without fear of retaliation. When employees have the  power to speak up and raise concerns in a safe environment, our entire organization thrives.  
By deepening our ethical culture and modeling  it not only for employees but for our suppliers  and customers as well we have an opportunity to  make a meaningful impact in advancing responsible  business and spreading ethical practices. 
 As we saw from our Ethical Culture  Survey results, when we talk about  ethics and compliance issues, trust  goes up, and people are more willing  to raise issues right away. This gives  us the opportunity to immediately  address concerns, ultimately making  our company stronger.   
Mark Gursky Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer  
 When we enhance our compliance  program to be a lighthouse for the rest  of the company, it becomes a great  recruiting and retention tool. Who  wouldn t want to work at a company  where they can be their true self and  turn to someone if they need help or  have questions?

Corporate Governance 
Staying  Accountable  with Sound  Governance 
A strong approach to corporate governance  provides KLA with the foundation for sustainable  growth. We are committed to having the proper  rules, practices and processes in place to run  our business responsibly and in compliance with  applicable regulations, standards and mandates.   
We strive to uphold the principles of corporate  governance accountability, transparency,  fairness and responsibility in everything we  do. We know that good corporate governance  helps companies build trust with investors and  the community since it shows our direction  and business integrity. As a result, it helps us  promote financial viability by creating a long-term  investment opportunity for the market.   
Here s how corporate governance works at KLA: 
   Each Board committee has its own charter, which defines the oversight responsibilities of those  committees.   
   The Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Talent  Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee.  
   Management has a responsibility to the Board to ensure that the Board and its committees are fully  informed about the company, its activities, employees, customers and suppliers.  
   KLA is governed by a Board of Directors established in accordance with applicable laws and the  company s Corporate Governance Standards.

Seeking Improvement at  Every Turn 
Even with a good framework in place, effective  corporate governance is an evolving journey. We  strive to meet the evolving needs of shareholders,  employees, customers, suppliers and the  communities we impact. We re always looking for  ways to improve our programs. 
 One of my personal goals is to  continuously be a leader in corporate  governance. This requires a consistent  and ongoing comparison against our  peer group to stay ahead of the curve.   
Jeffrey Cannon Associate General Counsel  
Since our last report, we made the  following governance improvements: 
   Stakeholders requested more environmental  disclosures on our website. Specifically, they  asked for a comprehensive ESG report. This  report and our ESG program are a direct  response to that request. We will continue to  grow our reporting and disclosure on these  critical topics.  
   We strengthened our shareholder outreach  initiatives. We currently conduct shareholder  outreach on an annual basis to determine what  improvements some of our largest shareholders  would like to see at KLA. We also keep in close  communication with shareholders regarding  our company, products and services through  our investor relations website, which includes  SEC filings, press releases, public earnings calls  and conference webcasts. 
   We made changes to the Compensation and  Talent Committee charter include oversight  of human capital, incorporating inclusion and  diversity, and the audit committee now annually  reviews cybersecurity initiatives.  
   We continue to report our climate progress to  CDP's global environmental impact disclosure  system and our overall ESG efforts to the  Dow Jones Sustainability Index to gauge our  progress against peers and strive for continuous  improvement.

GRI 103-2 The management approach  and its components 
Maintaining clear and consistent corporate governance practices helps KLA build trust with investors, customers, employees and the  broader community. Strong management of corporate governance helps promote financial viability by creating a long-term investment  opportunity for market participants, creating transparency of controls and aligning shareholders, directors and officers. Without strong  corporate governance, KLA risks losing cohesive direction as an organization, trust within the investor community and financial viability. 
KLA s approach to managing corporate governance starts with the Board of Directors and its three committees: Audit, Compensation  and Talent, and Nominating and Governance. There is a charter for each committee, outlining the associated oversight responsibilities.  Members of the Board communicate directly with KLA s chief legal officer regarding corporate governance expectations. The chief legal  officer, together with the associate general counsel, work to disseminate expectations to the executive leadership team and the entire  employee body. Employees take courses on anti-corruption and bribery, regulatory compliance, insider trading, conflicts of interest and  other corporate governance topics through KLA s Corporate Learning Center.

At KLA, we believe that maintaining a strong culture of ethics and compliance provides many benefits, including motivating employees,  delivering value to shareholders, establishing trust with customers and building a positive corporate reputation. We are committed to  upholding the highest ethical standards in everything we do, and clearly communicating these expectations to all KLA employees. Over  the past several years, KLA has acquired several companies which introduced a substantial number of new employees across a broad  geographic reach. Familiarizing new employees, both from outside hiring and through acquisitions, with KLA's ethics and compliance  standards is a key focus for company leadership. 
KLA s vice president and chief compliance officer leads company efforts on ethics and compliance. Our Standards of Business Conduct  is available in 10 languages and establishes company-wide ethics and compliance standards covering topics such as conflicts of  interest, anti-bribery and corruption, protecting sensitive information, government relations and antitrust and competition laws.  We partner with an independent organization to host an ethics portal and hotline, called EthicsPoint, which is available to all KLA  employees and business partners. When concerns or questions are submitted anonymously through the portal hotline, they are  routed to a KLA employee trained to conduct relevant investigations. Our chief compliance officer provides quarterly updates to  the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on ethics and compliance topics and strategies, including on investigation matters  and reports submitted through KLA s EthisPoint hotline. The full Board of Directors also reviews and approves any changes to KLA s  Standards of Business Conduct on an annual basis.  Periodically, KLA conducts a survey to gauge employee perceptions of the  company s ethics program.

The manufacturing process for KLA products is relatively energy-intensive, which directly impacts the greenhouse gas emissions from  our operations.

Omission statement: This metric is not relevant to KLA as the company does not emit a significant amount of perfluorinated  compounds from our operations. 
In 2021, KLA completed a comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions inventory covering our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.  We are using the results of that assessment to update our long- and short-term strategies to manage emissions. We are also currently  developing emissions reduction targets based off our inventory. 
Water management is material to KLA because company facilities located in high water stress regions are at risk of increased  operating costs as the resource becomes more constrained. By effectively and efficiently managing our water use, KLA can reduce  operating expenses, improve operational resilience, reduce exposure to potential regulations and positively impact the ability of local  communities to access water.

Percentage of employees  that are (1) foreign  nationals and

As a global company, KLA has employees around the world. About 70% of our employees are based outside of the United States.  
KLA is committed to upholding the human rights and dignity of all people, including those employed through KLA, our subsidiaries and  affiliates, and our suppliers. In addition, KLA believes that any activities that fuel social conflict, violate human rights or lead to serious  environmental degradation are unacceptable. Incidents associated with human or labor rights can severely damage KLA s reputation  both internally and externally, lead to compliance and legal costs and lawsuits and damage business relationships. By building and  maintaining robust policies and protections of human and labor rights, KLA can remain a trusted employer and a business partner to  employees, government regulators, business partners and investors. 
KLA has robust policies and procedures in place to ensure respect for labor and human rights across our operations. We have a  separate effort focused on upholding the same high standards for human and labor rights protections in our supply chain. We  communicate these standards with all suppliers through the KLA Supply Chain Human Rights Policy  by including our expectations in  the terms and conditions of all KLA purchase and supplier agreements  maintaining a Standards of Business Conduct for suppliers,  agents, and non-employee workers  and engaging suppliers through resources provided by the Responsible Business Alliance.     Before partnering with a company, KLA evaluates potential suppliers through a selection and qualification process that is a critical part  of our supply chain management strategy. These evaluations include site visits and or quality audits of the supplier s people, processes  and capabilities against pre-determined evaluation criteria. During these assessments, the team qualifies how well the supplier meets  KLA s standards. Only the suppliers that meet KLA s standards and the overall selection criteria are chosen. The selected suppliers  become part of KLA s supply base and are managed for continuous improvement through the KLA Supplier Scorecard program.     The KLA Supplier Scorecard includes several qualitative and quantitative criteria used to ensure suppliers continue to adhere to KLA s  policies and standards. When a supplier s performance is below a certain level on the Scorecard, we create a Supplier Action Request.  KLA will discontinue business with suppliers that fail to either improve their Supplier Scorecard rating over a defined period or resolve  requests in a timely manner. Our efforts to manage existing suppliers include planned business reviews, site visits and performance  audits, which consider supplier adherence to KLA human rights policies.

The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees is of the utmost importance to KLA. Based on our business model, KLA has  employees who predominately work in offices, those who work at our factories and those who travel to customer sites to help with  installation, upkeep and updates of KLA products. These different job types bring with them slightly different health and safety risks,  which we recognize and address through different trainings, policies and programs. Additionally, we recognize the importance of  promoting and supporting the physical, mental and emotional wellbeing of our employees, which positions them to do their best work  and minimizes risks for KLA. 
KLA has a robust management program and runs multiple training efforts to maintain a consistent approach to employee health and  safety across our global locations. Every new hire at KLA completes a health and safety orientation within their first week on the job.  Each KLA manufacturing facility has a safety committee composed of local KLA health and safety experts that conduct quarterly safety,  security and space audits. The results of these internal audits are used to create a facility-specific report card which highlights areas  for improvement. We retain a fulltime ergonomist to optimize safety and human engineering for our products and safe, user-friendly  work methods and environments for our employees. We provide regular ergonomic trainings to empower each employee with the  information and tools they need to conduct more regular self-assessments. We also participate in routine external audits led by local  government bodies based on the location of our facilities as well as customer-driven audits. 
All SPTS sites are certified to ISO 45001 occupational health and safety standards. KLA is in the process of rolling out a company-wide  health and safety management system, which will be aligned with ISO 45001 standards. 
We identify potential hazards in our facilities by conducting weekly inspections of chemical areas  utilization of our online Safety  Incident Reporting System (SIRS) to report injuries, illnesses, accidents, near-misses or suggestions  and conducting quarterly  safety, space and security audits. Once we identify a hazard, injury or near-miss, the facility manager along with members of the  environmental, health and safety team, conducts an accident investigation to correct the hazard and determine the root cause.  Currently, the Milpitas facility is in the process of implementing elements of the ISO 45001 Standard, which includes conducting  a health and safety assessment of the facility. SPTS, being ISO 45001 certified, has conducted numerous health and safety risk  assessments, and in Singapore, health and safety assessments have been completed as required by the Ministry of Manpower.

KLA is part of an industry where success is defined by a company s ability to rapidly innovate new technologies, tools and solutions.  To maintain a competitive advantage and serve the needs of our customers, KLA must invest significant amounts of human and  financial capital into innovation efforts. At KLA, we drive innovation through a combination of creating new technologies as well as close  collaboration with customers to enhance existing technologies. 
KLA s approach to managing innovation is overseen by the engineering leads of the different business areas based on product offering.  Engineering leads communicate innovation plans, objectives and corresponding needs through an annual strategic planning process.  One of the results of the strategic planning process is a balance scorecard which tracks the objectives set by the executive leadership  team and functional leaders. The scorecard is used to ensure alignment in the direction of product development and accountability  for accomplishing objectives. To encourage standardization across the organization, KLA has one product lifecycle process (PLC)  which defines the steps for driving innovation and subsequent product development and product lifetime management in the field.  The PLC provides guidelines from cradle to grave, including the following stages of product service development: concept, prototype,  integration into tools, qualification for sale, rollout to customers and maintaining viability and affordability. The PLC outlines key  performance indicators and considerations for our product teams to track as they move throughout the innovation and development  process. KLA invests heavily in training opportunities for employees to encourage innovation and empower individuals to contribute to  the development of next-generation technologies. 
More than 99% or KLA products, by revenue, contain declarable substances. 
Omission statement: This metric is not relevant to KLA as the company does not produce chips. However, KLA does enable chip makers  to produce more efficient chips, and we also deploy much computing in KLA products themselves, and hence our products function  with far greater relative energy efficiency as chip efficiencies improve.

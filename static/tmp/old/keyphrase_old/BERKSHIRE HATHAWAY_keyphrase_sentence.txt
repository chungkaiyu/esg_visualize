As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include liabilities for reported claims and for claims not yet  reported.", "Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations.", "The legal  environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.", "Our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $120.8 billion (including liabilities  from retroactive reinsurance), of which 83% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.", "The key  assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (\u201cfrequency\u201d) and average loss per  claim (\u201cseverity\u201d).", "We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and  chain-ladder methodologies.  Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (\u201cBI\u201d), uninsured motorists, and  personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development  estimates.", "We  select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.", "We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age  projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number  of unreported claims.", "We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim  counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate.", "We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are  difficult to apply.", "We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure  models and paid and incurred loss triangles.", "Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2019 were reduced by $253 million during 2020, which produced a  corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings.", "Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual  frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.", "With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average severities will change by at  least one percentage point from the severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2020.", "We estimate  that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $300 million increase or decrease in  recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings.", "Many of the economic forces that would  likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in  the same direction.", "In those instances,  we allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.  In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information  received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms.  Contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary  insurance policies.", "Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers.", "Reinsurers may assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, which may further  delay the reporting of claims.", "As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so  there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms.", "We maintain  certain internal procedures in order to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms.  Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company\u2019s records with respect to the subject business,  thus providing the ability to audit the reported information.", "In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise  concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies.", "We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation  with the client.", "If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution  processes.", "There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on  our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.", "Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients.  We generally rely on the ceding companies reported case loss estimates.", "We independently evaluate certain reported case  losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate.", "For instance, as of December 31, 2020, our case loss  estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $800 million for certain legacy workers\u2019 compensation  claims occurring over 10 years ago.", "We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may  cause us to adjust our case estimates.  Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, BHRG uses a variety  of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns,  industry data and other benchmarks, as appropriate.", "The estimate of the required IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by  actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and  handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts.", "Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not  limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claim  reviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; and  legal trends that result in unanticipated losses.", "Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss  emergence patterns.", "However, our processes  and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost  associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.", "Additional Analysis \u2013 in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis,  determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an  anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate.", "Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over  time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy of  the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims.", "Anticipated loss ratios are also revised  to include estimates of known major catastrophe events.  Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the  paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.", "Our  processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of  the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns  of past losses.", "For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of  the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years  reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.", "As a result, we reduced  estimated ultimate losses for prior years\u2019 loss events by $160 million.", "We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of  the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new  exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.", "Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates.", "Claim liabilities  relating to our retroactive reinsurance contracts are predominately related to casualty or liability exposures.", "Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that  maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $56 billion.", "We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends.", "In establishing  our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under  various scenarios.", "We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined.", "We  then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information  concerning the underlying losses.", "We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant  deviations from expected results are revealed.", "Our  estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020.", "When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying  loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses.", "Judgments in these areas necessarily  consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated.", "Legal reform  and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.", "We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020,  which after the changes in related deferred charge assets, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $230 million.", "In 2020, we paid losses  and loss adjustment expenses of $1.1 billion with respect to these contracts.", "In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets, which at contract  inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received.", "We  amortize deferred charge assets, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing  and amount of loss payments.", "We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate  amount of claim payments.", "Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred  charge balances and the amount of periodic amortization.", "Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2020, we  currently estimate that amortization expense in 2021 will approximate $1.1 billion.", "Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.7 billion and  other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion.", "We evaluate

indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our  reporting units and intangible assets.", "If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset  exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.", "If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to  earnings as an impairment loss.", "In response to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we considered whether goodwill needed to be  reevaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2020.", "We determined it was necessary to quantitively reevaluate  goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC.", "As a result of our reviews, we recorded  pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638  million of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC.", "Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing  circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing  for impairments.", "As of December 31, 2020, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance  Sheet was not impaired.", "Making estimates of the fair value of reporting units at this time is and will likely be significantly  affected by assumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit\u2019s business, which  we cannot reliably predict.", "Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations.", "The  effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could prove to be worse than we currently estimate and could lead us to record additional  goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in 2021.", "We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values.", "A significant amount of judgment is required in  estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests.", "Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to  market risks.", "Our significant market

believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns  of past losses.", "For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of  the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years  reflecting the paid or incurred development

loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

scenarios and an expected outcome is determined.", "We  then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information  concerning the underlying losses.", "We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant  deviations from expected results are revealed.", "Our  estimated liabilities for such claims were

impact on our ultimate liabilities.", "We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020,  which after the changes in related

believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns  of past losses.", "For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of  the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years  reflecting the paid or incurred development

loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

scenarios and an expected outcome is determined.", "We  then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information  concerning the underlying losses.", "We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant  deviations from expected results are revealed.", "Our  estimated liabilities for such claims were

impact on our ultimate liabilities.", "We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020,  which after the changes in related

believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns  of past losses.", "For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of  the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years  reflecting the paid or incurred development

loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

scenarios and an expected outcome is determined.", "We  then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information  concerning the underlying losses.", "We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant  deviations from expected results are revealed.", "Our  estimated liabilities for such claims were

impact on our ultimate liabilities.", "We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020,  which after the changes in related

believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns  of past losses.", "For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of  the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years  reflecting the paid or incurred development

loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

scenarios and an expected outcome is determined.", "We  then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information  concerning the underlying losses.", "We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant  deviations from expected results are revealed.", "Our  estimated liabilities for such claims were

impact on our ultimate liabilities.", "We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years\u2019 retroactive reinsurance contracts by $399 million in 2020,  which after the changes in related

believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns  of past losses.", "For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of  the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years  reflecting the paid or incurred development

loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1  billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings.", "We believe it is reasonably possible for  these assumptions to increase at these rates.", "For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the  claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our  nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $900 million, although  outcomes of greater than or less than $900 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.", "Loss estimations for these  exposures are

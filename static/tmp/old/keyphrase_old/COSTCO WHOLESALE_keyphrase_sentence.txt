of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our U.S. segment, due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, our core merchandise categories, and the LIFO charge, partially offset by the reserve for certain inventory in 2020.", "These decreases were offset by an increase of five basis points related to a partial reversal of a product tax assessment in 2020, as well as an increase of four basis points related to a write-off of certain information technology assets in the fourth quarter of 2021 that are no longer expected to be utilized as part of the modernization of our information systems.", "Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A

net sales and membership fees.", "Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors,

fixed-rate debt.", "See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.", "Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates.", "We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking

not intend to engage in speculative transactions.", "A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non- functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2021, would have

our results of operations.", "The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability.", "We believe our gasoline business draws members, but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our non-gasoline business.", "It also has lower SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales compared to our non-gasoline business.", "Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales.", "uncertainty with respect to how tariffs will affect the costs of some of our merchandise.", "The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs.", "Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years.", "This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue.", "Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.", "Our financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs.", "While we believe that we have achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses.", "With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits.", "Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce.", "This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces.", "Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, can have substantial impacts on net income.", "In discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are references to the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.", "This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period.", "Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31.", "We paid $515 in incremental wages during 2021 related to COVID-19.", "Effective March 1, 2021, we permanently increased wages for hourly and most salaried warehouse employees.", "Additionally, in certain areas in the United States governments have mandated or are considering mandating extra pay for classes of employees that include our employees, which has and will result in higher costs.", "Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years.", "Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted net sales by approximately $2,759, or 169 basis points, compared to 2020, attributable to our Canadian and Other International operations.", "At the end of 2021, our member renewal rates were 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 89% worldwide.", "Our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date.", "We account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis, recognized ratably over the one- year membership period.", "Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar positively impacted gross margin by approximately $301 in 2021.", "Gross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our U.S. segment, due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, our core merchandise categories, and the LIFO charge, partially offset by the reserve for certain inventory in 2020.", "These decreases were offset by an increase of five basis points related to a partial reversal of a product tax assessment in 2020, as well as an increase of four basis points related to a write-off of certain information technology assets in the fourth quarter of 2021 that are no longer expected to be utilized as part of the modernization of our information systems.", "Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A expenses by approximately $228 in 2021.", "For more information on our debt arrangements, refer to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.", "Foreign-currency transaction gains, net include mark-to-market adjustments for forward foreign-exchange contracts and revaluation or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities by our Canadian and Other International operations.", "Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments.", "Management believes that our cash and investment position and operating cash flows as well as capacity under existing and available credit agreements will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the foreseeable future.", "We believe that our U.S. current and projected asset position is sufficient to meet our U.S. liquidity requirements.", "Our cash flow provided by operations is primarily from net sales and membership fees.", "Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers.", "In 2021, we spent $3,588 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately $3,800 to $4,200 during fiscal 2022.", "There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs or based on the current economic environment.", "In 2020, we issued $4,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and repaid $3,200 of Senior Notes.", "During 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 1,358,000 and 643,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of $364.39 and $308.45, respectively, totaling approximately $495 and $198, respectively.", "We maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes.", "At August 29, 2021, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities of $1,050.", "Our international operations maintain $574 of the total borrowing capacity under bank credit facilities, of which $201 is guaranteed by the Company.", "The bank credit facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities.", "The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.", "In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements.", "The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S.", "GAAP) requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.", "We base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, and we continue to review and evaluate these estimates.", "Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to seek to limit exposures arising from very large losses.", "We use different risk management mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, and participate in a reinsurance program.", "Liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions.", "The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims over time.", "While we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities.", "Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.", "Recent Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.", "Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.", "We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.", "Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents, as defined in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, as well as short-term investments in government and agency securities with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase.", "The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields.", "The majority of our short-term investments are in fixed interest-rate securities.", "These securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations.", "Our policy limits investments in the U.S. to direct U.S. government and government agency obligations, repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. government and government agency obligations, U.S. government and government agency money market funds, and insured bank balances.", "Our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in U.S. government and government agency obligations and U.S. government and government agency money market funds.", "Our Canadian and Other International subsidiaries\u2019 investments are primarily in money market funds, bankers\u2019 acceptances, and bank certificates of deposit, generally denominated in local currencies.", "A 100 basis point change in interest rates as of the end of 2021 would have had an immaterial incremental change in fair market value.", "The nature and amount of our long-term debt may vary as a result of business requirements, market conditions, and other factors.", "Fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed-rate debt.", "See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.", "Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates.", "We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency.", "We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions.", "A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non- functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2021, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $149 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.", "In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 29, 2021 and August 30, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 52-week periods ended August 29, 2021, August 30, 2020 and September 1, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.", "Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.", "We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.", "We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.", "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.", "Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.", "Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.", "We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.", "The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.", "The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.", "We identified the evaluation of the Company\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation self-insurance liabilities for the United States operations as a critical audit matter because of the extent of specialized skill and knowledge needed to evaluate the underlying assumptions and judgments made by the Company in the actuarial models.", "The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.", "We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company\u2019s self-insurance workers' compensation process.", "We have audited Costco Wholesale Corporation and subsidiaries\u2019 (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.", "In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 29, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013

financial reporting based on our audit.", "We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.", "We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.", "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.", "Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.", "Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.", "We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.", "The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.", "The accompanying

and among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.", "Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.", "These available-for-sale investments have a low level of inherent credit risk given they are issued by the U.S.", "Changes in their fair value are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and market liquidity.", "Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.", "Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value.", "Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.", "The Company believes the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues.", "Leasehold improvements made after the beginning of the initial lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining term of the initial lease plus any renewals that are reasonably certain at the date the leasehold improvements are made.", "Expenditures for remodels, refurbishments and improvements that add to or change the way an asset functions or that extend the useful life are capitalized.", "In the event that the carrying value is not considered recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized for the asset group to be held and used equal to the excess of the carrying value above the estimated fair value of the asset group.", "Our leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.", "As the rate implicit in the Company's leases is not easily determinable, the present value of the sum of the lease payments is calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate.", "These liabilities are accreted over time to the projected future value of the obligation.", "Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is not subject to amortization.", "Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses.", "The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.", "The Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business.", "The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions.", "Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member.", "Revenue from shop cards is recognized upon redemption, and estimated breakage is recognized based on redemption data.", "Compensation expense for the accelerated shares is recognized upon achievement of the long-service term.", "The cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any point in time equals at least the portion of the grant-date fair value of the award that is vested at that date.", "The fair value of RSUs is calculated as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period.", "Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax credits and loss carry-forwards.", "The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.", "A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not expected to be realized.", "The timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions requires significant judgment.", "The benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements only after determining a more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities.", "When facts and circumstances change, the Company reassesses these probabilities and records any changes as appropriate.", "The par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted by allocation to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.", "These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired.", "Fair value adjustments to nonfinancial assets during 2021 were immaterial and there were no fair value adjustments to these items during 2020.", "There were no outstanding balances at the end of 2020.",

special dividend paid through our 401(k) plan.", "The gross unrecognized tax benefit includes tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.", "At the end of 2021 and 2020, these amounts were immaterial.", "The total amount of such unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods is $30 and $28 at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively.", "It is not practical to estimate the effect, if any, of any amount of such change during the next 12 months to previously recorded uncertain tax positions in connection with the audits.", "The Company does not anticipate that there will be a material increase or decrease in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.", "Other possible losses or range of possible losses associated with these examinations are either immaterial or an estimate of the possible loss or

achieved successes in this area, some significant costs are partially outside our control, particularly health care and utility expenses.", "With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits.", "Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce.", "This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces.", "Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements of income, particularly merchandise costs and selling,

of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our U.S. segment, due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, our core merchandise categories, and the LIFO charge, partially offset by the reserve for certain inventory in 2020.", "These decreases were offset by an increase of five basis points related to a partial reversal of a product tax assessment in 2020, as well as an increase of four basis points related to a write-off of certain information technology assets in the fourth quarter of 2021 that are no longer expected to be utilized as part of the modernization of our information systems.", "Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A

net sales and membership fees.", "Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers.", "In

facilities have various expiration dates, most of which are within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities.", "The amount of borrowings available at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.", "In the opinion of management, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements.", "The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally

we retain are not discounted and are estimated by using historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions.", "The costs of claims are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate as a result of inflation rates, regulatory or legal changes, and unforeseen developments in claims over time.", "While we believe our estimates are reasonable and provide for a certain degree of coverage to account for these variables, actual claims and costs could differ significantly from recorded liabilities.", "Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material.", "Recent Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.", "Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.", "We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial

fixed-rate debt.", "See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.", "Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates.", "We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency.", "We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions.", "A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non- functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2021, would have

is primarily from net sales and membership fees.", "Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from

foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates.", "We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward

foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates.", "We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward

of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased in our U.S. segment, due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, our core merchandise categories, and the LIFO charge, partially offset by the reserve for certain inventory in 2020.", "These decreases were offset by an increase of five basis points related to a partial reversal of a product tax assessment in 2020, as well as an increase of four basis points related to a write-off of certain information technology assets in the fourth quarter of 2021 that are no longer expected to be utilized as part of the modernization of our information systems.", "Changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar increased our SG&A

net sales and membership fees.", "Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers.", "In

have not been material.", "Recent Accounting Pronouncements We do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our financial statements.", "Our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.", "We do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial

fixed-rate debt.", "See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.", "Our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates.", "We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency.", "We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions.", "A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non- functional currency exchange rates at August 29, 2021, would have

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.", "Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.", "The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.",

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which

in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations.", "While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings.", "Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices.", "Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.", "Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.", "The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.",

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

"The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.",

in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

facilities to support our business, which includes the production of certain private-label items.", "Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cCOST.\u201d On September 28, 2021, we had 9,958 stockholders of record.", "In 2021, we combined the hardlines and softlines merchandise categories into non-foods.", "We believe that the most important driver of our profitability is increasing net sales, particularly comparable sales growth.", "Net sales includes our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), warehouse ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and other businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel and other).", "We define comparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations.", "While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings.", "Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices.", "Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.", "Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.", "The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.", "The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability.", "Our operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report).", "During 2021, our sales mix began returning to pre-pandemic levels.", "This included sales increases in non-foods and in many of our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, certain of which experienced closures or restrictions in 2020.", "COVID-related supply and logistics constraints have adversely affected some merchandise categories and are expected to do so for the foreseeable future.", "\u2022 We opened 22 new warehouses, including 2 relocations: 12 net new in the U.S., 4 net new in our Canadian segment, and 4 new in our Other International segment, compared to 16 new warehouses, including 3 relocations in 2020; \u2022 Net sales increased 18% to $192,052 driven by a 16% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2020 and 2021;", "Sales increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market.", "In 2020, we acquired Innovel (Costco Wholesale Logistics) and a minority interest in Navitus.", "Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses.", "We opened 22 new warehouses, including two relocations, in 2021, and plan to open approximately up to 35 additional new warehouses, including five relocations, in 2022.", "We have experienced delays in real estate and construction activities due to COVID-19.", "The contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar.", "We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:", "These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to

not corroborated by market data.", "The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale.", "Goodwill represents the acquisition's benefits to the Company, which include the ability to serve more members and improve delivery times, enabling growth in certain segments of our U.S. e-commerce operations.", "Under the supervision of and with the participation of our

majority-owned subsidiary in Taiwan.", "Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol \u201cCOST.\u201d", "The material seasonal impact in our operations is increased net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season.", "We operate membership warehouses and e-commerce websites based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally-branded and private-label products in a wide range of categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover.", "When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers.", "We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to cross-docking consolidation points (depots) or directly to our warehouses.", "Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to warehouses.", "This process creates freight volume and handling efficiencies, lowering costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels.", "commerce operations we ship merchandise through our depots, our logistics operations for big and bulky items, as well as through drop-ship and other delivery arrangements with our suppliers.", "Our average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger.", "Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate.", "By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.", "Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week.", "Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere.", "We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors.", "We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers.", "We average anywhere from 9,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses.", "Warehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently.", "Net sales for our gasoline business represented approximately 9% of total net sales in 2021.", "Our other businesses sell products and services that complement our warehouse operations (core and warehouse ancillary businesses).", "Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services.", "This figure does not consider other services we offer online in certain countries such as business delivery, travel, same-day grocery, and various other services.", "Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries.", "Business centers are included in our total warehouse count.", "We have direct buying relationships with many producers of brand-name merchandise.", "We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier.", "The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented supply constraints, including disruptions and delays that have impacted and could continue to impact the flow and availability of certain products.", "When sources of supply become unavailable, we seek alternative sources.", "We also purchase and manufacture private-label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are high and the value to our members is significant.", "Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):", "Our Code of Ethics requires that we \u201cTake Care of Our Employees,\u201d which is fundamental to the obligation to \u201cTake Care of Our Members.\u201d We must also carefully control our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, so that we can sell high quality goods and services at low prices.", "At the end of 2021, we employed 288,000 employees worldwide.",

rate was above 90% for employees who have been with us for at least one year.", "The commitment to \u201cTake Care of Our Employees\u201d is also the foundation of our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion and creating an inclusive and respectful workplace.", "In 2021, we added training and communication for managers on topics of race, bias and equity, and greater visibility of our employee demographics.", "Embracing differences is important to the growth of our Company.", "It leads to more opportunities, innovation, and employee satisfaction and connects us to the communities

larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other domestic markets.", "Declines in financial performance of our U.S. operations, particularly in California, and our Canadian operations could arise from, among other things: slow growth or declines in comparable warehouse sales (comparable sales); negative trends in operating expenses, including increased labor, healthcare and energy costs; failing to meet targets for warehouse openings; cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses; shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products; changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets, including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values; and failing to consistently provide high quality and innovative new products.", "We may be

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to

in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to

in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to

"The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.",

in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

"The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.", "Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.", "The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.",

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to

"The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.", "Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.", "The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.",

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.", "Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.", "The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.",

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.", "Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.", "The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.",

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations.", "While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.", "Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.", "The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.",

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to

in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which

investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.",

in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in

increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening

net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one year.", "Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions.", "Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term.", "Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.", "Net sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations.", "While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the penetration of our private-label items and through online offerings.", "Our philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices.", "Our investments in merchandise pricing may include reducing prices on merchandise to drive sales or meet competition and holding prices steady despite cost increases instead of passing the increases on to our members, all negatively impacting gross margin as a percentage of net sales (gross margin percentage).", "A higher penetration of gasoline sales will generally lower our gross margin percentage.", "The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to cost increases.", "We also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses.", "As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth.", "The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets, are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations.", "Our rate of operating floor space square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue.", "Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower gross margin percentage relative to our warehouse operations.", "The membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability.",

future.", "\u2022 We opened 22 new warehouses, including 2 relocations: 12 net new in the U.S., 4 net new in our Canadian segment, and 4 new in our Other International segment, compared to 16 new warehouses, including 3 relocations in 2020; \u2022 Net sales increased 18% to $192,052 driven by a 16% increase in comparable sales and sales at new warehouses opened in 2020 and 2021;", "Sales increases were also strong in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, predominantly e-commerce and gasoline.", "Comparable sales increased 16% during 2021 and were positively impacted by increases in shopping frequency and average ticket.", "The gross margin of our core merchandise categories (foods and sundries, non-foods and fresh foods), when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), increased 23 basis points.", "This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.", "This increase was due to a two basis point improvement in our core merchandise categories, predominantly non-foods, and in our warehouse ancillary and other businesses, largely e-commerce.", "Our Canadian and Other International segments increased, primarily due to our warehouse ancillary and other businesses and certain of our core merchandise categories.", "Preopening expenses vary due to the number of warehouse and facility openings, the timing of the opening relative to our year-end, whether the warehouse is owned or leased, and whether the opening is in an existing, new or international market.", "In 2020, we acquired Innovel (Costco Wholesale Logistics) and a minority interest in Navitus.", "Our primary requirements for capital are acquiring land,

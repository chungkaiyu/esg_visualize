shopping experience.", "Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors, including the success of our investments in One Supply Chain and the One Home Depot experience, and our failure to successfully manage these factors and offer competitive delivery and pickup options could negatively impact the demand for our products and our profit

be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectations on delivery or pickup times, options and costs.", "In addition, a greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment or curbside pickup could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-selling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial performance.", "Failure to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; and to effectively implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment could adversely affect our relationship with

variety of well-recognized brand names.", "We have also developed relationships with selected suppliers to allow us to market proprietary products that are comparable to national brands.", "Our proprietary products differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than national brand products, and represent a growing portion of our business.", "If we are unable to manage

integration of the target company\u2019s products, services, associates, and information technology, financial, human resources, compliance, and other systems and processes, and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure.", "Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition.", "In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, and operations and make them more difficult to manage.", "Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated,

retain highly qualified associates to provide excellent customer service and to support our strategic initiatives while also controlling our labor costs.", "Our customers expect a high level of customer service and product knowledge from our associates.", "To meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, develop and retain a large number of highly qualified associates.",

health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing demographics; and our reputation within the labor market.", "We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction.", "These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market.",

successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition.", "In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, and operations and make them more difficult to manage.", "Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail

large number of highly qualified associates.", "Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing demographics; and our reputation within the labor market.", "We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction.", "These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention

store location and appearance, presentation of merchandise, and ease of shopping experience.", "Our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup times, options and costs depends on many factors,

times, options and costs.", "In addition, a greater concentration of online sales with direct fulfillment or curbside pickup could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-selling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sales and adversely affect our financial performance.", "Failure to provide a compelling online presence; to timely identify or respond to changing consumer preferences, expectations and home improvement needs; to maintain appropriate inventory; to provide quick and low-price or free delivery alternatives and convenient pickup options; to differentiate the customer experience for our primary customer groups; and to effectively implement an increasingly localized

third-party service providers, employing new web-based tools and services, implementing new technologies, implementing and restructuring support systems and processes, identifying appropriate facility

systems and processes, and then successfully manage that integration into our corporate structure.", "Integration can be a complex and time-consuming process, and if the integration is not fully successful or is delayed for a material period of time, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies or benefits of the acquisition.", "In addition, the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems, internal controls, and operations and make them more difficult to manage.", "Furthermore, even if the target companies are successfully integrated, the acquisitions may fail

large number of highly qualified associates.", "Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, immigration, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits; changing demographics; and our reputation within the labor market.", "We also compete with other retail businesses for many of our associates in hourly positions, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction.", "These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market.", "In addition, in order to continue to create the One Home Depot experience and build One Supply Chain, we must attract and retain a large number of

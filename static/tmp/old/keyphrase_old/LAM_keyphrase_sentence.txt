quarterly basis and will continue to assess the need for changes in valuation allowances, if any.", "We re-evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.", "Any change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.", "A critical accounting policy is defined as one that has both a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.", "Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates, which could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.", "We believe that the

amortization.", "Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services by following a five-step process, (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation, as further described below.", "We generally consider documentation of terms with an approved purchase order as a customer contract, provided that collection is considered probable, which is assessed based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks, payment histories, and/or other circumstances.", "The transaction price for our contracts with customers consists of both fixed and variable consideration provided it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty related to variable consideration is resolved.", "We generally invoice customers at shipment and for professional services either as provided or upon meeting certain milestones.", "Our contracts with customers typically do not include significant financing components as

revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation.", "Revenue for systems and spares are recognized at a point in time, which is generally upon shipment or delivery.", "Revenue from services is recognized over time as services are completed or ratably over the contractual period of generally one year or less.", "Obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management\u2019s estimated usage requirement is written down to its estimated net realizable value if less than cost.", "Warranty: We record a provision for estimated warranty expenses to cost of sales for each system when we recognize revenue.", "We periodically monitor the performance and cost of warranty activities, if actual costs incurred are different than our estimates, we may recognize adjustments to provisions in

this time.", "In the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, an adjustment will be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.", "Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, then the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed.", "We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position.", "Our policy is

quarter of each fiscal year and if certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests.", "The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill requires significant judgment.", "When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.", "We determine the fair value of our reporting units by using an income approach.", "Under the income approach, we determine fair value based on estimated future cash

investor would expect to earn.", "In estimating the fair value of a reporting unit, we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of our reporting units, including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment.", "Although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses, there is significant judgment involved in determining the cash flows attributable to a reporting unit.", "In addition, we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets to the estimated balance sheets of our reporting units.", "Changes in judgment on these assumptions and estimates could result in a goodwill impairment charge.", "If after completing the quantitative assessment the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value, up to the amount of the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit.", "For other long-lived assets, we review them whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable.", "If such indicators are present, we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets is less than their carrying value.", "If the sum is less, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values.", "Fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows, appraisals or other methods.", "We recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the asset\u2019s carrying value.", "The fair value of the asset then becomes the asset\u2019s new carrying value, which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset.", "In addition, for fully amortized intangible assets, we de-recognize the gross cost and accumulated amortization in the period we determine the intangible asset no longer enhances future cash flows.", "This decrease was primarily due to Common Stock repurchases in connection with our stock repurchase program, dividends paid, and principal payments on long-term debt, partially offset by cash provided by operating activities.", "Anticipated cash flows from operations based on our current business outlook, combined with our current levels of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of June 27, 2021, are expected to be sufficient to support our anticipated levels of operations, investments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, capital redistributions, and dividends through at least the next twelve months.", "In the longer term, liquidity will depend to a great extent on our future revenues and our ability to appropriately manage our costs based on demand for our products and services.", "While we have substantial cash balances, we may require additional funding and need or choose to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities.", "We believe that, if necessary, we will be able to access the capital markets on terms and in amounts adequate to meet our objectives.", "However, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has in the past caused disruption in the capital markets, and were it to do the same in the future, that could make any financing more challenging, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.", "We have certain obligations to make future payments under various contracts, some of which are recorded on our balance sheet and

intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.", "The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand.", "The industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry.", "Variability in our customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results.", "The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.", "The changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.", "During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis.", "If we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods

portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability.", "As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict.", "Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes.", "We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products.", "If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.", "Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.", "These restrictions and measures, incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, and suppliers, have affected

transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the implementation of business continuity plans; requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on- site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects; and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of

difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen.", "In addition, there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks, threats and incidents in a timely manner, or at all, or to respond expediently, appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents, and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products.", "In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of \u201cbig data\u201d or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers.", "Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes.", "Our business is affected by our customers\u2019 use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes.", "Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.", "Outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization.", "These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events

additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements

intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.", "The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand.", "The industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry.", "Variability in our customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results.", "The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.", "The changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.", "During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis.", "If we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.", "For example, the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand

and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.", "We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment.", "If we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity and resources too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment, resulting in excess fixed costs.", "Especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes.", "Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.", "Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits.", "With the consolidation of customers within the industry, the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers.", "The economic, political, and business conditions occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.", "As a result, changing economic, political or business conditions can cause material adverse

residual value guarantee with the lessor; and \u2022 challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.", "Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability.", "As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict.", "Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes.", "We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products.", "If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.", "Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.", "These restrictions and measures, incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, and suppliers, have affected

transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the implementation of business continuity plans; requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on- site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects; and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce.", "These impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause delays in product shipments and product development, increases in costs, and decreases in revenue, profitability and

sensitive information, those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents.", "It has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen.", "In addition, there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks, threats and incidents in a timely manner, or at all, or to respond expediently, appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents, and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products.", "In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of \u201cbig data\u201d or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers.", "Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes.", "Our business is affected by our customers\u2019 use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes.", "Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.", "Outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization.", "These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events

customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results.", "The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.", "The changes in demand may require our

to predict.", "Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes.", "We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products.", "If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.", "Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in

intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.", "The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand.", "The industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry.", "Variability in our customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results.", "The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.", "The changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.", "During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis.", "If we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.", "For example, the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand

and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.", "We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment.", "If we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity and resources too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment, resulting in excess fixed costs.", "Especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes.", "Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.", "Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits.", "With the consolidation of customers within the industry, the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers.", "The economic, political, and business conditions occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.", "As a result, changing economic, political or business conditions can cause material adverse

residual value guarantee with the lessor; and \u2022 challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.", "Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability.", "As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict.", "Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes.", "We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products.", "If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.", "Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.", "These restrictions and measures, incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, and suppliers, have affected

transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the implementation of business continuity plans; requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on- site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects; and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce.", "These impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause delays in product shipments and product development, increases in costs, and decreases in revenue, profitability and

sensitive information, those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents.", "It has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen.", "In addition, there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks, threats and incidents in a timely manner, or at all, or to respond expediently, appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents, and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products.", "In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of \u201cbig data\u201d or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers.", "Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes.", "Our business is affected by our customers\u2019 use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes.", "Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.", "Outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization.", "These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events

customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results.", "The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.", "The changes in demand may require our

to predict.", "Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes.", "We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products.", "If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.", "Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in

intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.", "The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand.", "The industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry.", "Variability in our customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results.", "The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.", "The changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.", "During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis.", "If we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.", "For example, the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand

and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.", "We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment.", "If we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity and resources too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment, resulting in excess fixed costs.", "Especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes.", "Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.", "Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits.", "With the consolidation of customers within the industry, the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers.", "The economic, political, and business conditions occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.", "As a result, changing economic, political or business conditions can cause material adverse

residual value guarantee with the lessor; and \u2022 challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.", "Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability.", "As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict.", "Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes.", "We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products.", "If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.", "Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.", "These restrictions and measures, incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, and suppliers, have affected

transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the implementation of business continuity plans; requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on- site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects; and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce.", "These impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause delays in product shipments and product development, increases in costs, and decreases in revenue, profitability and

sensitive information, those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents.", "It has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen.", "In addition, there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks, threats and incidents in a timely manner, or at all, or to respond expediently, appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents, and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products.", "In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of \u201cbig data\u201d or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers.", "Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes.", "Our business is affected by our customers\u2019 use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes.", "Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.", "Outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization.", "These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events

customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results.", "The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.", "The changes in demand may require our

to predict.", "Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes.", "We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products.", "If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.", "Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in

intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.", "The semiconductor capital equipment industry has historically been characterized by rapid changes in demand.", "The industry environment has moved toward being more characterized by variability across segments and customers, accentuated by consolidation within the industry.", "Variability in our customers\u2019 business plans may lead to changes in demand for our equipment and services, which could negatively impact our results.", "The variability in our customers\u2019 investments during any particular period is dependent on several factors, including but not limited to electronics demand, economic conditions (both general and in the semiconductor and electronics industries), industry supply and demand, prices for semiconductors, and our customers\u2019 ability to develop and manufacture increasingly complex and costly semiconductor devices.", "The changes in demand may require our management to adjust spending and other resources allocated to operating activities.", "During periods of rapid growth or decline in demand for our products and services, we face significant challenges in maintaining adequate financial and business controls, management processes, information systems, and procedures for training, assimilating, and managing our workforce, and in appropriately sizing our supply chain infrastructure and facilities, work force, and other components of our business on a timely basis.", "If we do not adequately meet these challenges during periods of increasing or declining demand, our gross margins and earnings may be negatively impacted.", "For example, the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted and could further impact our ability to meet the demand

and travel and logistics restrictions in connection with the outbreak.", "We continuously reassess our strategic resource allocation choices in response to the changing business environment.", "If we do not adequately adapt to the changing business environment, we may lack the infrastructure and resources to scale up our business to meet customer expectations and compete successfully during a period of growth, or we may expand our capacity and resources too rapidly and/or beyond what is appropriate for the actual demand environment, resulting in excess fixed costs.", "Especially during transitional periods, resource allocation decisions can have a significant impact on our future performance, particularly if we have not accurately anticipated industry changes.", "Our success will depend, to a significant extent, on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our senior management to identify and respond to these challenges effectively.", "Our business depends on the capital equipment expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits.", "With the consolidation of customers within the industry, the semiconductor capital equipment market may experience rapid changes in demand driven both by changes in the market generally and the plans and requirements of particular customers.", "The economic, political, and business conditions occurring nationally, globally, or in any of our key sales regions, which are often unpredictable, have historically impacted customer demand for our products and normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors.", "As a result, changing economic, political or business conditions can cause material adverse

residual value guarantee with the lessor; and \u2022 challenges maintaining reliable and uninterrupted sources of supply.", "Sales to a limited number of large customers constitute a significant portion of our overall revenue, shipments, cash flows, collections, and profitability.", "As a result, the actions of even one customer may subject us to variability in those areas that is difficult to predict.", "Rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes subject us to increased pressure to develop technological advances that enable those processes.", "We believe that our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop and offer new products with improved capabilities and to continue to enhance our existing products.", "If new products or existing products have reliability, quality, design, or safety problems, our performance may be impacted by reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses.", "We may be unable to develop and manufacture products successfully, or products that we introduce may fail in the marketplace.", "For more than 25 years, the primary driver of technology advancement in the semiconductor industry has been to shrink the lithography that prints the circuit design on semiconductor chips.", "That driver could be approaching its technological limit, leading semiconductor manufacturers to investigate more complex changes in multiple technologies in an effort to continue technology development.", "In the face of uncertainty on which technology solutions will become successful, we will need to focus our efforts on developing the technology changes that are ultimately successful in supporting our customer requirements.", "Our failure to develop and offer the correct technology solutions in a timely manner with productive and cost-effective products could adversely affect our business in a material way.", "Our failure to commercialize new products in a timely manner could result in loss of market share, unanticipated costs, and inventory obsolescence, which would adversely affect our financial results.", "In order to develop new products and processes and enhance existing products and processes, we expect to continue to make significant investments in R&D, to investigate the acquisition of new products and technologies, to invest in or acquire such business or technologies, and to pursue joint development relationships with customers, suppliers, or other members of the industry.", "Our investments and acquisitions may not be as successful as we may expect, particularly in the event that we invest in or acquire product lines and technologies that are new to us.", "We may find that acquisitions are not available to us, for regulatory or other reasons, and that we must therefore limit ourselves to collaboration and joint venture development activities, which do not have the same benefits as acquisitions.", "Pursuing development through collaboration and/or joint development activities rather than through an acquisition poses substantial challenges for management, including those related to aligning business objectives; sharing confidential information, intellectual property and data; sharing value with third parties; and realizing synergies that might have been available in an acquisition but are not available through a joint development project.", "We must manage product transitions and joint development relationships successfully, as the introduction of new products could adversely affect our sales of existing products and certain jointly developed technologies may be subject to restrictions on our ability to share that technology with other customers, which could limit our market for products incorporating those technologies.", "Future technologies, processes, or product developments may render our current product offerings obsolete, leaving us with non-competitive products, obsolete inventory, or both.", "This shift may result in a reduction in the size of our addressable markets or could increase the relative size of markets in which we either do not compete or have relatively low market share.", "Increasingly, semiconductor manufacturing companies are entering into strategic alliances or consolidating with one another to expedite the development of processes and other manufacturing technologies and/or achieve economies of scale.", "In certain instances, this could work to our disadvantage if a competitor\u2019s tools or equipment become the standard equipment for such functions or processes.", "Additional outcomes of such consolidation may include our customers re-evaluating their future supplier relationships to consider our competitors\u2019 products and/or gaining additional influence over the pricing of products and the control of intellectual property or data.", "Similarly, our customers may partner with, or follow the lead of, educational or research institutions that establish processes for accomplishing various tasks or manufacturing steps.", "If those institutions utilize a competitor\u2019s equipment when they establish those processes, it is likely that customers will tend to use the same equipment in setting up their own manufacturing lines.", "These actions could adversely impact our market share and financial results.", "Semiconductor manufacturers must make a substantial investment to qualify and integrate wafer processing equipment into a semiconductor production line.", "We believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer selects a particular supplier\u2019s processing equipment, the manufacturer generally relies upon that equipment for that specific production line application for an extended period of time, especially for customers that are more focused on tool reuse.", "Accordingly, we expect it to be more difficult to sell our products to a given customer for a product line application if that customer initially selects a competitor\u2019s equipment for the same product line application.", "We face significant competition from multiple competitors, and with increased consolidation efforts in our industry, as well as the emergence and strengthening of new, regional competitors, we may face increasing competitive pressures.", "Other companies continue to develop systems and/or acquire businesses and products that are competitive to ours and may introduce new products and product capabilities that may affect our ability to sell and support our existing products.", "We face a greater risk if our competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading semiconductor manufacturers covering products similar to those we sell or may develop, as this could adversely affect our ability to sell products to those manufacturers.", "We believe that to remain competitive we must devote significant financial resources to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 needs, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process R&D.", "Technological changes and developing technologies, have required, and are expected to continue to require, new and costly investments.", "Certain of our competitors, including those that are created and financially backed by foreign governments, have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer service and support resources than we do and therefore have the potential to offer customers a more comprehensive array of products and/or product capabilities and to therefore achieve additional relative success in the semiconductor equipment industry.", "We also face competition from our own customers, who in some instances have established affiliated entities that manufacture equipment similar to ours.", "In many cases speed to solution is necessary for customer satisfaction and our competitors may be better positioned to achieve these objectives.", "For these reasons, we may fail to continue to compete successfully worldwide.", "In addition, our competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements.", "In particular, while we continue to develop product enhancements that we believe will address future customer requirements, we may fail in a timely manner to complete the development or introduction of these additional product enhancements successfully, or these product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance or be competitive.", "Accordingly, competition may intensify, and we may be unable to continue to compete successfully in our markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows.", "These restrictions and measures, incidents of confirmed or suspected infections within our workforce or those of our suppliers or other business partners, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, and suppliers, have affected

transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers; requiring modifications to our business processes; requiring the implementation of business continuity plans; requiring the development and qualification of alternative sources of supply; requiring the implementation of social distancing measures that require changes to existing manufacturing processes; disrupting business travel; disrupting our ability to staff our on- site manufacturing and research and development facilities; delaying capital expansion projects; and necessitating teleworking by a large proportion of our workforce.", "These impacts have caused and are expected to continue to cause delays in product shipments and product development, increases in costs, and decreases in revenue, profitability and

sensitive information, those security procedures and mitigation and protection systems cannot be guaranteed to be fail-safe and we may still suffer cybersecurity and other incidents.", "It has been difficult and may continue to be difficult to hire and retain employees with substantial cybersecurity acumen.", "In addition, there have been and may continue to be instances of our policies and procedures not being effective in enabling us to identify risks, threats and incidents in a timely manner, or at all, or to respond expediently, appropriately and effectively when incidents occur and repair any damage caused by such incidents, and such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "We derive a substantial percentage of our revenues from a limited number of products.", "In addition, the fact that we offer limited product lines creates the risk that our customers may view us as less important to their business than our competitors that offer additional products and/or product capabilities, including new products that take advantage of \u201cbig data\u201d or other new technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.", "This may impact our ability to maintain or expand our business with certain customers.", "Such product concentration may also subject us to additional risks associated with technology changes.", "Our business is affected by our customers\u2019 use of our products in certain steps in their wafer fabrication processes.", "Should technologies change so that the manufacture of semiconductors requires fewer steps using our products, this could have a larger impact on our business than it would on the business of our less concentrated competitors.", "Outsource providers and component suppliers have played and will continue to play a key role in our product development, manufacturing operations, field installation and support, and many of our transactional and administrative functions, such as information technology, facilities management, and certain elements of our finance organization.", "These providers and suppliers might suffer financial setbacks, be acquired by third parties, become subject to exclusivity arrangements that preclude further business with us, or be unable to meet our requirements or expectation due to their independent business decisions or force majeure events

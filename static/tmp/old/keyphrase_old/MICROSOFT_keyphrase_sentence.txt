fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations.", "The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because

Surface.", "To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers.", "These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline.", "Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies.", "We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so.", "Worsening

financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be

statements.", "Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers.", "Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues.", "These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis.",

fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations.", "The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, price changes in products using licensed patents, greater value from cross-licensing, or the difficulty of discovering infringements.", "Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.", "From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights.", "The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface.", "To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or

software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\u2019 computing environments.", "To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.", "Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and

software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\u2019 computing environments.", "To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.", "Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and

products or services could adversely affect our revenue.", "Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business.", "We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy.", "For example, in October 2018 we completed our acquisition of GitHub, Inc. (\u201cGitHub\u201d) for $7.5 billion, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in April 2021 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Nuance Communications, Inc. for $19.7 billion.", "These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed.", "The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones.", "Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms.", "Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT.", "These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks.", "Nation state and state sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits.", "Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users\u2019 security or systems or reveal confidential information.", "Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them.", "We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time.", "Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers.", "Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business.", "We may be targets of further attacks similar to Solorigate/Nobelium as both a supplier and consumer of IT.", "In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve.", "Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies.", "We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies.", "Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge.", "The security of our products and services is important in our customers\u2019 decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on- premises environments.",

customers.", "Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data.", "Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue.", "In addition, adversaries can attack our customers\u2019 on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (\u201czero day\u201d) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products.", "Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers\u2019 systems.", "Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation.", "Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer\u2019s use of our products or services.", "We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products.", "There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks.", "Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years.", "They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards.", "As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available.", "Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers\u2019 vulnerability to attack.", "Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies.", "In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults.", "The Solorigate/Nobelium or similar cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised.", "We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves.", "We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation.",

software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers\u2019 computing environments.", "To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers\u2019 systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so.", "Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our product and services.", "The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins.", "If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services.", "Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices.", "Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue.", "Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties.", "As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud- based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users.", "The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security.", "Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage.", "Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host.", "Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities.", "Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services.", "LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures.", "Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement.", "Advertising, professional, and social platform abuses", "For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, MSN, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate.", "This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends.", "We may not proactively

ability to be updated or patched.", "IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements.", "We are building AI into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow.", "We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives.", "As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business.", "Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions.", "These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm.", "If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.", "We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations

introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com.", "We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users.", "Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks.", "It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve.", "Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements.", "Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software.", "We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of

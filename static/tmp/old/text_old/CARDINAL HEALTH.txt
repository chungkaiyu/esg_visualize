Introduction Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations About Cardinal Health Cardinal Health, Inc. is an Ohio corporation formed in 1979 and is a globally integrated healthcare services and products company providing customized solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, pharmacies, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, physician offices and patients in the home. We provide pharmaceuticals and medical products and cost-effective solutions that enhance supply chain efficiency. We connect patients, providers, payers, pharmacists and manufacturers for integrated care coordination and better patient management. We manage our business and report our financial results in two segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical. Pharmaceutical Segment Our Pharmaceutical segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and over-the-counter healthcare and consumer products in the United States. This segment also provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers for specialty pharmaceutical products operates nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities provides pharmacy management services to hospitals, as well as medication therapy management and patient outcomes services to hospitals, other healthcare providers and payers and repackages generic pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter healthcare products. MD&A Results of Operations 3 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Medical Segment Our Medical segment manufactures, sources and distributes Cardinal Health branded medical, surgical and laboratory products, which are sold in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and other markets. In addition to distributing Cardinal Health branded products, this segment also distributes a broad range of medical, surgical and laboratory products known as national brand products and provides supply chain services and solutions to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories and other healthcare providers in the United States and Canada. This segment also distributes medical products to patients' homes in the United States through our Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division. Consolidated Results Fiscal 2020 Overview Revenue Revenue for fiscal 2020 was 152.9 billion, a 5 percent increase from the prior year, primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers. GAAP and Non-GAAP Operating Earnings The sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. We had a GAAP operating loss of 4.1 billion during fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 5.63 billion pre-tax charge we recognized for the estimated liability associated with lawsuits and claims brought against us by states and political subdivisions relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications as described in the Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section in this MD&A and Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." GAAP operating earnings during fiscal 2019 were favorably impacted by a 508 million pre-tax gain from the divestiture of a majority interest in our naviHealth Holdings, LLC ("naviHealth") business. The increase in non-GAAP operating earnings was primarily due to the beneficial impact of enterprise-wide cost-savings measures, a higher contribution from branded pharmaceutical sales mix, the favorable year-over-year impact of fiscal 2019 charges related to an exclusive distribution agreement with a Medical segment supplier and growth from specialty solutions, partially offset by the adverse impact of Pharmaceutical segment customer contract renewals and the adverse impact of the pandemic associated with the novel strain of coronavirus ( COVID-19 ). See the Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section of this MD&A. GAAP and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS The sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. (1) Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. ("diluted EPS" or "diluted loss per share") (2) The reconciling items are presented within this table net of tax. See quantification of tax effect of each reconciling item in our GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations in the "Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures." (3) For fiscal 2020, GAAP diluted loss per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. and the EPS impact from the GAAP to non-GAAP per share reconciling items are calculated using a weighted average of 293 million common shares, which excludes potentially dilutive securities from the denominator due to their anti-dilutive effects resulting from our GAAP net loss for the period. Fiscal 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using a weighted average of 295 million common shares, which includes potentially dilutive shares.

("GAAP diluted EPS") during fiscal 2020 due to the charge we recognized for the estimated liability associated with lawsuits and claims brought against us by states and political subdivisions relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications. The charge had a (17.54) per share after tax impact on GAAP diluted EPS. GAAP diluted EPS during fiscal 2020 was favorably impacted by a 1.68 per share gain from the sale of the remainder of our equity interest in naviHealth described further in Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section in this MD&A and Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements". GAAP diluted EPS during fiscal 2019 included a 1.26 per share gain from the divestiture of our majority interest in naviHealth. Fiscal 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 3% to 5.45. This increase was primarily due to the factors discussed above impacting non-GAAP operating earnings, as well as a lower share count as a result of share repurchases and lower interest expense due to less debt outstanding and lower interest rates. The year- over-year comparison was unfavorably impacted by a higher effective tax rate due to the benefit in the prior-year from discrete tax items, largely related to international legal entity changes. Cash and Equivalents Our cash and equivalents balance was 2.8 billion at June 30, 2020 compared to 2.5 billion at June 30, 2019. The increase in cash during fiscal 2020 was due to net cash provided by operating activities of 2.0 billion and 886 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of investments, offset by cash deployed of 1.4 billion for debt repayments, 569 million for dividends and 350 million for share repurchases. MD&A Results of Operations 5 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic continues to severely impact the U.S. and global economies. Our businesses have been impacted in a variety of ways beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as discussed in the following paragraphs and under Results of Operations. We estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic had a net negative impact to operating earnings (loss) of approximately 100 million in fiscal 2020. Within our manufacturing and distribution facilities, we have implemented sustained protocols designed to protect the safety of our employees and maintain continuity of our operations, and have generally continued to operate our distribution and manufacturing facilities in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, in line with various governmental recommendations to reduce large gatherings and practice social distancing, we have enabled most office-based employees to work remotely. These measures have created additional burdens on our infrastructure and information technology systems. Furthermore, if a significant number of our employees are unable to perform their duties for a period of time, we may experience difficulties in operating one or more of our facilities which could adversely impact our financial results. Since the third quarter of fiscal 2020, our Medical segment has seen dramatically increased demand for certain personal protective equipment ( PPE ), such as masks, gowns and gloves. We manufacture, source and distribute some PPE products and distribute PPE manufactured by others. This increased demand resulted in an increase in sales volume for certain products in fiscal 2020. The cost to manufacture and source certain PPE products has also significantly increased, which had a slight negative impact on our margin for these products in fiscal 2020 and is expected to have a larger negative impact in fiscal 2021. We continue to seek alternate and additional sources for these products and otherwise mitigate cost increases. We also are increasing certain PPE product prices to reflect some of our higher costs and are seeking to modify affected customer contracts. If these efforts are unsuccessful, our margins may be adversely impacted even more significantly. In addition, we could experience decreased sales and customer disputes. Federal, state and local governmental policies and orders and certain private initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 also resulted in, among other things, the cancellation or deferral of many elective medical procedures and some of our customers closing or severely curtailing their operations. As a result, our Medical segment has experienced decreased sales volume (apart from PPE products described above), which had a negative impact on Medical segment profit in fiscal 2020 and which we currently assume will have a negative impact in fiscal 2021. The decrease in elective procedures and physician office visits has also resulted in a significant decrease in sales by our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division in our Pharmaceutical segment in fiscal 2020. Fluctuating or decreasing elective procedure volume may have a greater or lesser adverse impact on the sales of these products and services than we anticipate. Our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions businesses experienced a temporary increase in sales volume during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which we believe to be related to accelerated purchasing by some customers due to the COVID-19 pandemic and which was largely offset by a decrease in sales volume in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We assume fiscal 2021 Pharmaceutical segment revenue will be negatively impacted by COVID-19, and we are uncertain when sales volume will return to pre-COVID-19 levels. Political, legal or regulatory actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in certain jurisdictions where we manufacture, source or distribute products have created supply disruptions within both our Medical and, to a lesser extent, our Pharmaceutical segments and are likely to cause additional supply disruptions or shortages in the future. We cannot currently predict the frequency, duration or scope of these governmental actions and supply disruptions. For example, several countries have increased or instituted new restrictions on the export of medical or pharmaceutical products that we distribute or use in our businesses, including key components or raw materials. Additionally, governmental authorities in many countries, including the U.S., are considering enacting legislative or regulatory changes to address the impact of the pandemic, which may restrict or require changes in our operations, increase our costs, or otherwise adversely affect our operations. In March 2020, the U.S enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which provided a variety of benefits for businesses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2020, we received a cash flow benefit related to the deferral of payroll and income tax payments and a small tax benefit from the employee retention credit under this Act. We currently anticipate that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a further negative impact on fiscal 2021 consolidated operating earnings and Medical segment profit. However, we cannot estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or of the related U.S. or global economic consequences on our business and operations, including whether and when historic economic and operating conditions will resume or the extent to which the disruption may impact our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow, and its impact maybe greater or less than we anticipate. MD&A Results of Operations Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 6 Opioid Lawsuits In October 2019, we agreed in principle to a global settlement framework with a leadership group of state attorneys general that is designed to resolve all pending and future opioid lawsuits and claims by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs (the "Settlement Framework"). This Settlement Framework is subject to contingencies and uncertainties as to final terms, but is the basis for our negotiation of definitive terms and documentation. The Settlement Framework includes (1) a cash component, pursuant to which we would pay up to 5.56 billion over eighteen years, (2) development and participation in a program for free or rebated distribution of opioid abuse treatment medications for a period of ten years, and (3) to-be specified industry-wide changes to distributor controlled substance anti-diversion programs. We also agreed, with two other national distributors, to a 215 million settlement with two plaintiff counties. Our portion of that settlement was 66 million, which was paid in January 2020. In connection with these matters, we recorded a total pre-tax charge of 5.63 billion ( 5.14 billion after tax) during fiscal year 2020 in litigation (recoveries) charges, net, in the consolidated statement of earnings (loss) for the cash component. We accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. Moreover, definitive terms for a settlement pursuant to the Settlement Framework continue to be negotiated, and there is no assurance that the necessary parties will agree to a definitive settlement agreement or that the contingencies to any agreement will be satisfied. We regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether our accrual is adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual. See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. Also in connection with these matters, we recorded a tax benefit of 488 million, which is net of unrecognized tax benefits of 469 million, during fiscal 2020, reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid under the 5.63 billion accrual taken in connection with the opioid litigation. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. For tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition, we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. Our assumptions and estimates around this benefit and uncertain tax position require significant judgment since the definitive settlement terms and documentation, including provisions related to deductibility, under the Settlement Framework have not been negotiated and the U.S. tax law governing deductibility was changed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( Tax Act ). We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management's judgment and our current understanding of the Tax Act. Further, it is possible that the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the Tax Act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits. The actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Gain on Sale of Equity Interest in naviHealth As described further in Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements," in May 2020 we sold the remainder of our equity interest in a partnership that owned naviHealth. We recognized a pre-tax gain of 579 million ( 493 million after tax) from this disposal in gain on sale of equity interest in naviHealth in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss). Other Trends In addition to the trends and uncertainties described above under the caption Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends, the performance of our Pharmaceutical segment generics program, which includes generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes and Red Oak Sourcing, adversely impacted Pharmaceutical segment profit in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 however, in fiscal 2020 our generics program had a slightly favorable impact on Pharmaceutical segment profit. As is generally the case, the frequency, timing, magnitude and profit impact of generic pharmaceutical customer pricing changes, customer contract renewals, and branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing changes remain uncertain and their impact on Pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings in fiscal 2021 could be more or less than we expect. MD&A Results of Operations 7 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Results of Operations Revenue Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019 Pharmaceutical Segment Fiscal 2020 Pharmaceutical segment revenue grew primarily due to sales growth from pharmaceutical distribution and specialty solutions customers, which together increased revenue by 7.6 billion. Medical Segment Fiscal 2020 Medical segment revenue decreased due to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by sales growth from Cardinal Health at- Home Solutions. Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold for fiscal 2020 increased 7.4 billion (5 percent) due to the factors affecting the changes in revenue and gross margin.

Gross margin comparison to the prior year benefitted from the fiscal 2019 charges related to an exclusive distribution agreement with a Medical segment supplier. Gross margin rate declined during fiscal 2020 mainly due to the adverse impact of pharmaceutical customer contract renewals and changes in pharmaceutical distribution product mix. Distribution, Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019 Fiscal 2020 SG&A expenses increased due to higher costs to support sales growth and a 37 million charge in connection with a voluntary recall for Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ("AAMI") Level 3 surgical gowns and a voluntary recall and field actions for surgical procedure packs containing affected gowns (together, the "Recalls"), as described further within Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements".

See Note 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information on segment profit. Fiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019 Pharmaceutical Segment Profit Fiscal 2020 Pharmaceutical segment profit decreased largely due to the adverse impact of customer contract renewals, partially offset by higher contribution from our branded pharmaceutical sales mix and growth from specialty solutions. Pharmaceutical segment financial results do not include the 5.63 billion charge associated with the opioid litigation. See Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section in this MD&A and Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. Medical Segment Profit Fiscal 2020 Medical segment profit increased largely due to benefits from cost-savings measures and the favorable year-over-year impact of the fiscal 2019 charges related to an exclusive distribution agreement with a Medical segment supplier, partially offset by decreased sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical segment financial results do not include the 85 million charge incurred during fiscal 2020 in connection with the Recalls, as described further within Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements". Corporate The changes in Corporate during fiscal 2020 are due to the factors discussed in the Other Components of Consolidated Operating Earnings (Loss) section that follows.

Segment Profit and Operating Earnings Other Components of Consolidated Operating Earnings (Loss) In addition to revenue, gross margin, and SG&A expenses discussed previously, consolidated operating earnings (loss) were impacted by the following: Restructuring and Employee Severance In fiscal 2020 and 2019, restructuring costs are primarily related to implementation of certain enterprise-wide cost-savings measures. Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related Costs Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets was 512 million and 531 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the Patient Recovery Business were 7 million and 75 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Impairments and (Gain) Loss on Disposal of Assets, Net During fiscal 2019, we recognized a pre-tax gain of 508 million related to the divestiture of our majority interest in naviHealth. See also Gain on Sale of Equity Interest in naviHealth below with respect to the sale of the remainder of our equity interest in naviHealth in fiscal 2020. Litigation (Recoveries) Charges, Net During fiscal 2020, we recognized a pre-tax charge of 5.63 billion ( 5.14 billion after tax) associated with the opioid litigation. See Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section in this MD&A and Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we recognized 103 million and 117 million, respectively, of estimated losses and legal defense costs associated with inferior vena cava ("IVC") filter product liability claims. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we recognized income of 16 million and 94 million, respectively, for recoveries in class action antitrust lawsuits in which we were a class member. Other Components of Earnings (Loss) Before Income Taxes In addition to the items discussed above, earnings (loss) before income taxes was impacted by the following: Interest Expense, Net Fiscal 2020 interest expense decreased from fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower debt outstanding and lower interest rates. Loss On Early Extinguishment Of Debt During fiscal 2020, we recognized a 16 million loss in connection with the redemption and early debt repurchases as described further in Note 6 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." Gain on Sale of Equity Interest in naviHealth During fiscal 2020, we recognized a pre-tax gain of 579 million from the sale of our equity interest in a partnership that owned naviHealth, as described further in the Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section of this MD&A and Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements."

A reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate from continuing operations is as follows (see Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information): (1) The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 represents an income tax benefit tax rate. (2) The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 represents an income tax expense tax rate. Fiscal 2020 The fiscal 2020 effective income tax rate was impacted by the Settlement Framework, as described further in the Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section in this MD&A. Ongoing Audits We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2008 through the current fiscal year. Tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions, including U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") challenges to our international transfer pricing for the periods from 2008 to 2014, and it is possible that they will challenge others. These challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments.

If we decide to engage in one or more acquisitions, depending on the size and timing of such transactions, we may need to access capital markets for additional financing. To-date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not resulted in material changes to our liquidity and capital resources and has not impacted our ability to comply with financial commitments. Cash and Equivalents Our cash and equivalents balance was 2.8 billion at June 30, 2020 compared to 2.5 billion at June 30, 2019. The increase in cash during fiscal 2020 was due to net cash provided by operating activities of 2.0 billion, which reflects increases to working capital associated with the timing of payments to vendors, and 886 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of investments, substantially all of which was related to the sale of our equity interest in naviHealth, offset by cash deployed of 1.4 billion for debt repayments, 569 million for dividends and 350 million for share repurchases. At June 30, 2020, our cash and equivalents were held in cash depository accounts with major banks or invested in high quality, short-term liquid investments. During fiscal 2019, our cash and equivalents increased by 700 million due to 2.7 billion of net cash provided by operating activities and 737 million of net cash proceeds from the sale of our majority interest in naviHealth, offset by 1.1 billion paid for debt repayments, 600 million paid for share repurchases, 577 million paid in dividends and 328 million paid for capital expenditures. Changes in working capital, which impact operating cash flow, can vary significantly depending on factors such as the timing of customer payments, inventory purchases, payments to vendors and tax Other Financing Arrangements and Financial Instruments Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper In addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity at June 30, 2020 include a 2.0 billion commercial paper program, backed by a 2.0 billion revolving credit facility. We also have a 1.0 billion committed receivables sales facility. At June 30, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program, revolving credit facility or our committed receivables sales facility. During fiscal 2020, under our commercial paper program and our committed receivables program, we had maximum combined total daily amounts outstanding of 1.7 billion and an average combined daily amount outstanding of 195 million. Our revolving credit and committed receivables sales facilities require us to maintain, as of the end of every fiscal quarter through December 2020, a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 4.00-to-1. The maximum permitted ratio will reduce to 3.75-to-1 in March 2021 and as of the end of every quarter thereafter. As of June 30, 2020, we were in compliance with this financial covenant. MD&A Liquidity and Capital Resources 13 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K payments in the regular course of business, as well as fluctuating working capital needs driven by customer and product mix. The cash and equivalents balance at June 30, 2020 included 476 million of cash and equivalents held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. In June 2020, we returned 140 million of cash held by foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. As of June 30, 2020, foreign earnings of approximately 800 million are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs. The computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable. For amounts not considered indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded an immaterial amount of income tax expense in our financial statements in fiscal 2020. Long-Term Obligations At June 30, 2020, we had total long-term obligations, including the current portion and other short-term borrowings of 6.8 billion. In June 2020, we redeemed 500 million aggregate principle amount of 4.625% Notes due December 2020 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest, plus the make-whole premium applicable to the notes. In connection with the redemption, we recorded a 7 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. In November 2019, we repaid the full principal of the 2.4% Notes due 2019 at maturity for 450 million. During fiscal 2020, we also early repurchased 247 million of the 2.616% Notes due 2022, 11 million of the 3.2% Notes due 2022, 20 million of the Floating Rate Notes due 2022, 104 million of the 3.41% Notes due 2027, 6 million of the 4.6% Notes due 2043, 5 million of the 4.9% Notes due 2045, and 35 million of the 4.368% Notes due 2047. In connection with these early debt repurchases, we recognized a 9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. In fiscal 2019, we repaid 1.0 billion of 1.948% notes at maturity and repurchased a total of 100 million of notes due in 2022 and 2027. The loss on early extinguishment of debt from the fiscal 2019 early repurchases was immaterial. The redemption and repurchases were paid for with available cash and other short-term borrowings. Risk Management We use interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts to manage our exposure to cash flow variability. Capital Deployment Opioid Settlement Framework In October 2019, we agreed in principle to a Settlement Framework which includes a cash component, pursuant to which we would pay up to 5.56 billion over eighteen years. If a definitive agreement is reached, and subject to participation by states and political subdivisions, we expect payment amounts under the Settlement Framework to be spread through the 18-year period. We cannot currently predict when those payments might begin, and it is possible that they may ultimately be made over a different time period, or not at all. See Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section in this MD&A for additional information. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures during fiscal 2020 and 2019 were 375 million and 328 million, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2021 to be between 400 million and 450 million and to be primarily for information technology and infrastructure projects. MD&A Liquidity and Capital Resources Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 14 We also use interest rate swaps to protect the value of our debt and use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of our existing and forecasted foreign currency assets and liabilities. See the "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" section as well as Note 1 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the use of financial instruments and derivatives as well as foreign currency, interest rate and commodity exposures. Dividends During fiscal 2020, we paid quarterly dividends totaling 1.92 per share, an increase of 1 percent from fiscal 2019. On May 11, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of 0.4859 per share, or 1.94 per share on an annualized basis, which was paid on July 15, 2020 to shareholders of record on July 1, 2020. On August 5, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of 0.4859 per share, payable on October 15, 2020 to shareholders of record on October 1, 2020. Share Repurchases During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 350 million and 600 million, respectively, of our common shares. We funded the repurchases with available cash and short-term borrowing. See Note 11 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information. At June 30, 2020, we had 943 million authorized for share repurchases remaining under all programs. Contractual Obligations At June 30, 2020, our contractual obligations, including estimated payments due by period, were as follows: (1) Represents maturities of our long-term debt obligations and other short-term borrowings excluding finance lease obligations described below. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. (2) Represents minimum finance lease obligations included within long-term obligations in our consolidated balance sheet and further described in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Represents minimum operating lease obligations included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and further described in Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (4) A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is legally enforceable and specifies all significant terms, including fixed or Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no significant "off-balance sheet arrangements" at June 30, 2020, as that term is defined in the SEC rules.

Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. In addition, contracts that can be unilaterally canceled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period. Purchase obligations and other payments also includes quarterly payments of 45.6 million that we are required to pay CVS Health Corporation ("CVS") in connection with Red Oak Sourcing and will be in place for the remaining five years of the agreement. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (5) Long-term liabilities, such as unrecognized tax benefits, deferred taxes and other tax liabilities, have been excluded from the above table due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflows. See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for further discussion of income taxes. (6) Total contractual obligations do not include payments that may be made in connection with the opioid litigation, as further described in Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section in this MD&A and Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." If a definitive agreement is reached, and subject to participation by states and political subdivisions, we expect payment amounts under the Settlement Framework to be spread through the 18-year period. We cannot currently predict when those payments might begin, and it is possible that they may ultimately be made over a different time period, or not at all. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates Critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that (i) can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and (ii) require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management s judgment. Other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. Because estimates are inherently uncertain, actual results may differ. In this section, we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions. For further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted, and continues to severely impact the U.S. and global economies and, beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, our businesses have been impacted in a variety of ways. We cannot estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related U.S. and global economic consequences on our business and operations, including whether and when normal economic and operating conditions will resume or the extent to which the disruption may impact our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic could ultimately differ over time. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves. We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing accounts receivable aging, industry trends, customer financial strength and credit standing, historical write-off trends and payment history. We regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions, including the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect credit risks. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our policy for Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts. A hypothetical 0.1 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at June 30, 2020, would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 8 million. We believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2020 are appropriate. At this time, we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board s amended accounting guidance that requires entities to measure credit losses Inventories A substantial portion of our inventories (56 percent at both June 30, 2020 and 2019) are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, or market. These are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our Pharmaceutical segment ( distribution facilities ). The LIFO impact on the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) depends on pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and our fiscal year-end inventory levels, which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year- end. Historically, prices for branded pharmaceuticals have generally tended to rise, resulting in an increase in cost of products sold, whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline, resulting in a decrease in cost of products sold. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our policy for Inventories. MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 16 on trade and other receivables using an "expected credit loss" model that considers historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. We have evaluated the impact of adopting this new guidance and have determined it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. The following table presents information regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal years: Using LIFO, if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation, the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost. Conversely, if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline, the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost. The sum of the components may not equal the total due to rounding. (in millions, except percentages) 2020 2019 2018 Allowance for doubtful accounts at beginning of period 193 139 137 Charged to costs and expenses 140 141 114 Reduction to allowance for customer deductions and write-offs (127) (87) (111) Allowance for doubtful accounts at end of period 206 193 139 Allowance as a percentage of customer receivables 2.5% 2.3% 1.8% Allowance as a percentage of revenue 0.13% 0.13% 0.10% We believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities. As such, the LIFO reserve is the difference between (a) inventory at the lower of LIFO cost or market and (b) inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, inventories valued at LIFO cost were 411 million and 230 million higher than the average cost value. We do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost. As such, we did not write-up the value of our inventory from average cost to LIFO cost at June 30, 2020 or 2019. Our remaining inventory that is not valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market is stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount, which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. Qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. There is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for the annual goodwill impairment test in the current year. The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (also known as a component). We have two operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical. These operating segments are comprised of divisions (which are components), for which discrete financial information is available. Components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units are: Pharmaceutical operating segment (excluding our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division) Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division Medical operating segment (excluding our Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division) ( Medical Unit ) and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division. Goodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including the identification of reporting units, qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists and, if necessary, the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit. Our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the income-based and market-based approaches (using discount rates ranging from 8.5 percent to 10.5 percent). We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates 17 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 155 million and 171 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience, historical and projected sales trends, specific categories of inventory, age and expiration dates of on-hand inventory and manufacturer return policies. If actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions, additional inventory reserves may be required. internally-developed forecasts. Under the market-based guideline public company method, we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. We also use the market-based guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results. The use of alternate estimates and assumptions, changes in the industry or peer groups, or changes in weightings assigned to the discounted cash flow method, guideline public company method or guideline transaction method could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment. If a reporting unit fails to achieve expected earnings or operating cash flow, or otherwise fails to meet current financial plans, or if there were changes to any other key assumptions used in the tests, the reporting unit could incur a goodwill impairment in a future period. We performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 and, with the exception of our Medical Unit in fiscal 2018, concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. For our annual impairment test in fiscal 2020, the fair value of our Medical Unit exceeded its carrying value of 10.1 billion by approximately 7 percent. For this test, we used a discount rate of 8.5 percent and a terminal growth rate of 2 percent. Additionally, we assigned a weighting of 80 percent to the discounted cash flow method, 10 percent to the guideline public company method, and 10 percent to the guideline transaction method. The goodwill balance for our Medical Unit was 4.2 billion at June 30, 2020. Adverse changes in key assumptions, such as assumptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic which could cause a decrease in future cash flows an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate, among other things, could result in a goodwill impairment for the Medical Unit. For example, if we were to use a discount rate of 9.5 percent, the carrying value would have exceeded the fair value for our Medical Unit by 5.0 percent for fiscal 2020. Similarly, if we were to use a terminal growth rate of 0.5 percent, the carrying value would have exceed the fair value for our Medical Unit by less than 1.0 percent for fiscal 2020. For any of our other reporting units, the fair value would not have been less than the carrying amount for fiscal 2020 if we increased the discount rate by 1.0 percentage point or decreased the terminal growth rate by 1.0 percentage point. As discussed further in Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements," during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we recognized a 1.4 billion goodwill impairment charge related to our Medical Unit, which is included in impairments and (gain) loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss). There was no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charge. Loss Contingencies and Self-Insurance We accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or outcomes can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We also self-insure for employee healthcare, certain product liability matters, auto liability, property and workers' compensation and maintain insurance for individual losses exceeding certain limits when available. Self-insurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements on pending claims, defense costs, administrative fees, claims adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported. For certain types of exposures, we develop the estimate of expected ultimate costs to settle each claim based on specific information related to each claim if available. Other estimates are based on an assessment of outstanding claims, historical analysis and current payment trends. For claims incurred but not reported, the liabilities are calculated and derived in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices or using an estimated lag period. We regularly review contingencies and self-insurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. Any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. MD&A Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 18 The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily IPR&D) involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If so, then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the respective asset's carrying amount. Our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. See Note 1 of "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for additional information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets. Examples of such contingencies include various lawsuits related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and the Cordis IVC filter lawsuits. In connection with the opioid litigation as described further in the Significant Developments in Fiscal 2020 and Trends section in this MD&A, we recorded a pre-tax charge of 5.63 billion ( 5.14 billion after tax) during fiscal 2020. Definitive terms of a settlement under the Settlement Framework continue to be negotiated, and there is no assurance that the necessary parties will agree to a definitive settlement agreement or that the contingencies to any agreement will be satisfied. We develop and periodically update reserve estimates for the Cordis inferior vena cava ("Cordis IVC") claims, including those received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs. To project future Cordis IVC claim costs, we use a methodology based largely on recent experience, including claim filing rates, estimated indemnity severity by claim type, sales data, implant and injury to report lag patterns and estimated defense costs. The amount of loss may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits. Provision for Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate. Our income tax expense, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents information about our tax position at June 30: (1) Total deferred income tax assets included 589 million and 621 million of loss and tax credit carryforwards at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (2) The valuation allowance primarily relates to federal, state and international loss and credit carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Expiring or unusable loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the respective deferred tax assets will not be realized. After applying the valuation allowances, we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above. We operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. For tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition, we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. In connection with the 5.63 billion pre-tax charge for the opioid litigation, during fiscal year 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of 488 million, which is net of unrecognized tax benefits of 469 million, reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid. We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management's judgment and our current understanding of the Tax Act however, these estimates require significant judgment since the definitive settlement terms and documentation, including provisions related to deductibility, under the Settlement Framework have not been negotiated and the U.S. tax law governing deductibility was changed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act").

The actual amount of the tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 8 for more information regarding these matters. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2008 through the current fiscal year. Tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions, including IRS challenges to our international transfer pricing for the periods from 2008 to 2014, and it is possible that they will challenge others. These challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments. Our assumptions and estimates around uncertain tax positions require significant judgment the actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ from these estimates. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. The amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued. Changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated market conditions, tax law changes or other factors could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. For a further discussion on Provision for Income Taxes, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The calculation of our tax liabilities includes estimates for uncertainties in the application of broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code as per the Tax Act as enacted by the United States government on December 22, 2017. We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management judgment and our current understanding of the Tax Act which is subject to further interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Tax Act. Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This report, including the "Fiscal 2020 Overview" section within MD&A, contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition to analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate our performance, engage in financial and operational planning, and determine incentive compensation because we believe that these measures provide additional perspective on and, in some circumstances are more closely correlated to, the performance of our underlying, ongoing business. We provide these non- GAAP financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items and events on our financial and operating results on a year-over-year basis and in comparing our performance to that of our competitors. However, the non-GAAP financial measures that we use may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by us should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations to those financial statements set forth below should be carefully evaluated. Exclusions from Non-GAAP Financial Measures Management believes it is useful to exclude the following items from the non-GAAP measures presented in this report for its own and for investors assessment of the business for the reasons identified below: Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 20 LIFO charges and credits are excluded because the factors that drive last-in first-out ("LIFO") inventory charges or credits, such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciation or deflation and year-end inventory levels (which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal year-end), are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted. The exclusion of LIFO charges and credits from non-GAAP metrics facilitates comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies financial results. We did not recognize any LIFO charges or credits during the periods presented. Surgical gown recall costs includes inventory write-offs and certain remediation and supply disruption costs arising from the January 2020 recall of select Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ("AAMI") Level 3 surgical gowns and voluntary field actions (a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs) for Presource Procedure Packs containing affected gowns. We have excluded these costs from our non-GAAP metrics to allow investors to better understand the underlying operating results of the business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies financial results. State opioid assessments related to prior fiscal years is the portion of state assessments for prescription opioid medications that were sold or distributed in periods prior to the fiscal year of the initial assessment. This portion is excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because it is retrospectively applied to sales in prior fiscal years and inclusion would obscure analysis of the current fiscal year results of our underlying, ongoing business. Additionally, while states' laws may require us to make payments on an ongoing basis, the portion of the assessment related to sales in prior periods are contemplated to be one-time, nonrecurring items. Reversals of these accruals have occurred when certain assessments were found by a Court unconstitutional. Restructuring and employee severance costs are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business. Amortization and other acquisition-related costs, which include transaction costs, integration costs, and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations, are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business and to facilitate comparison of our current financial results to our historical financial results and to our peer group companies' financial results. Additionally, costs for amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets are non-cash amounts, which are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. We also exclude other acquisition- related costs, which are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entity s initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation. These costs are also significantly impacted by the timing, complexity and size of acquisitions. Impairments and gain or loss on disposal of assets are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount, and in the case of impairments, are non-cash amounts, so their exclusion facilitates comparison of historical, current and forecasted financial results. Litigation recoveries or charges, net are excluded because they often relate to events that may have occurred in prior or multiple periods, do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amount. The tax effect for each of the items listed above, other than the transitional tax benefit item, is determined using the tax rate and other tax attributes applicable to the item and the jurisdiction(s) in which the item is recorded. The gross, tax and net impact of each item are presented with our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. Definitions Growth rate calculation: growth rates in this report are determined by dividing the difference between current period results and prior period results by prior period results. Non-GAAP operating earnings: operating earnings (loss) excluding (1) LIFO charges (credits), (2) surgical gown recall costs, (3) state opioid assessment related to prior fiscal years, (4) restructuring and employee severance, (5) amortization and other acquisition-related costs, (6) impairments and (gain) loss on disposal of assets, and (7) litigation (recoveries) charges, net. Non-GAAP earnings before income taxes: earnings (loss) before income taxes excluding (1) LIFO charges (credits), (2) surgical gown recall costs, (3) state opioid assessment related to prior fiscal years, (4) restructuring and employee severance, (5) amortization and other acquisition-related costs, (6) impairments and (gain) loss on disposal of assets, (7) litigation (recoveries) charges, net, (8) loss on early extinguishment of debt and (9) gain on sale of equity interest in naviHealth. Non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc.: net earnings (loss) attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. excluding (1) LIFO charges (credits), (2) surgical gown recall costs, (3) state opioid assessment related to prior fiscal years, (4) restructuring and employee severance, (5) amortization and other acquisition- related costs, (6) impairments and (gain) loss on disposal of assets, (7) litigation (recoveries) charges, net, (8) loss on early extinguishment of debt and (9) gain on sale of equity interest in naviHealth, each net of tax, and (10) transitional tax benefit, net. Non-GAAP effective tax rate: provision for (benefit from) income taxes adjusted for (1) LIFO charges (credits), (2) surgical gown recall costs, (3) state opioid assessment related to prior fiscal years, (4) restructuring and employee severance, (5) amortization and other acquisition-related costs, (6) impairments and (gain) loss on disposal of assets, (7) litigation (recoveries) charges, net, (8) loss on early extinguishment of debt and (9) gain on sale of equity interest in naviHealth, each net of tax, and (10) transitional tax benefit, net divided by (earnings before income taxes adjusted for the first nine items). Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc.: non-GAAP net earnings attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. divided by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Explanation and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 21 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Loss on early extinguishment of debt is excluded because it does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance. Additionally, the amount and frequency of this type of charge is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the timing and size of debt extinguishment transactions. Gain on sale of equity interest in naviHealth was incurred in connection with the sale of our remaining equity interest in naviHealth in fiscal 2020. The equity interest was retained in connection with the initial sale of our majority interest in naviHealth during fiscal 2019. We exclude this significant gain because gains or losses on investments of this magnitude do not typically occur in the normal course of business and are similar in nature to a gain or loss from a divestiture of a majority interest, which we exclude from non-GAAP results. The gain on the initial sale of our majority interest in naviHealth in fiscal 2019 was also excluded from our non-GAAP measures. Transitional tax benefit, net related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is excluded because it results from the one-time impact of a very significant change in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and, due to the significant size of the benefit, obscures analysis of trends and financial performance. The transitional tax benefit includes the initial estimate and subsequent adjustments for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and the repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings. GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations 1 Attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. 2 For fiscal 2020, GAAP diluted loss per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. and the EPS impact from the GAAP to non-GAAP per share reconciling items are calculated using a weighted average of 293 million common shares, which excludes potentially dilutive securities from the denominator due to their anti-dilutive effects resulting from our GAAP net loss for the period. Fiscal 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using a weighted average of 295 million common shares, which includes potentially dilutive shares. 3 Litigation (recoveries) charges, net includes a pre-tax charge of 5.63 billion ( 5.14 billion after tax) recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 related to the opioid litigation. 4 Reflects the net transitional benefit from the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities partially offset by the repatriation tax on cash and earnings of foreign subsidiaries. See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information on the Tax Act. 5 During fiscal 2019, we sold our majority interest in naviHealth and recognized a pre-tax gain of 508 million ( 378 million after tax). 6 Fiscal year 2018 includes a goodwill impairment charge of 1.4 billion related to our Medical segment. There was no tax benefit related to this goodwill impairment charge. The sum of the components and certain computations may reflect rounding adjustments. We apply varying tax rates depending on the item's nature and tax jurisdiction where it is incurred.

There was no tax benefit related to this goodwill impairment charge. 6During fiscal 2018, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In fiscal 2018 we recognized a net transitional tax benefit of 936 million related to the enactment of the act. See Note 8 for more information.

These market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity price-related changes. We maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to some of these market exposures which employs operational, economic, and derivative financial instruments in order to mitigate risk. See Note 1 and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding our use of derivative instruments. Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity By the nature of our global operations, we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation. These exposures are transactional and translational in nature. The following foreign currencies represent the principal drivers of our foreign exchange exposure: Canadian dollar, euro, Thai baht, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, Australian dollar, British pound and Japanese yen. We apply a Value-At-Risk ("VAR") methodology to our transactional and translational exposures. The VAR model is a risk estimation tool and is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred. Transactional Exposure Transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than our functional currency or the functional currency of our subsidiaries. At the end of each fiscal year Interest Rate Sensitivity We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing and investing activities to maintain liquidity and fund operations. The nature and amount of our long-term and short-term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of business requirements, market conditions and other factors. Our policy is to manage exposures to interest rates using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt as deemed appropriate by management. We utilize interest rate swap instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movements. As part of our risk management program, we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the upcoming fiscal year. This analysis assumes a hypothetical 50 basis point change in interest rates. At June 30, 2020, the potential increase or decrease in annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change would be 5 million. Disclosures about Market Risk Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 24 we perform sensitivity analyses on our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year. These analyses include the estimated impact of our hedging program, which is designed to mitigate transactional exposure. Applying a VAR methodology to our transactional exposure and including the impact of our hedging program, the potential maximum loss in earnings for the upcoming fiscal year is estimated to be 12 million, which is based on a one- year horizon and a 95 percent confidence level. Translational Exposure We have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars, our functional currency. Applying a VAR methodology to our translational exposure, the potential maximum loss in earnings for the upcoming fiscal year is estimated to be 5 million, which is based on a one-year horizon and a 95 percent confidence level. We are also exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to our cash and cash equivalents, which includes marketable securities that are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of our cash and cash equivalents is subject to change primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers' credit worthiness. At June 30, 2020, a hypothetical increase or decrease of 50 basis points in interest rates would result in a hypothetical 5 million change in the estimated fair value. Commodity Price Sensitivity We are directly exposed to market price changes for certain commodities, including oil-based resins, nitrile, cotton, diesel fuel and latex. We typically purchase raw materials at either market prices or prices tied to a commodity index and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index. As part of our risk management program, we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted direct commodity exposure for the upcoming fiscal year. Our forecasted direct commodity exposure at June 30, 2020 increased approximately 10 million from June 30, 2019. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, we had hedged a portion of these direct commodity exposures (see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). Disclosures about Market Risk 25 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Our forecasted direct commodity exposures for the upcoming fiscal year is 445 million. The potential gain loss given a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in commodity prices, assuming pricing collectively shifts in the same direction and we are unable to change customer pricing in response to those shifts or otherwise offset, for the upcoming fiscal year is 45 million at June 30, 2020. The hypothetical offsetting impact of hedges in both periods was minimal. Business General Cardinal Health, Inc. is a global integrated healthcare services and products company providing customized solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, pharmacies, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, physician offices and patients in the home. We provide medical products and pharmaceuticals and cost-effective solutions that enhance supply chain efficiency. Pharmaceutical Segment In the United States, our Pharmaceutical segment: through its Pharmaceutical Distribution division, distributes branded and through its Specialty Solutions division, distributes specialty pharmaceutical through its Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division, operates nuclear See Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for Pharmaceutical segment revenue, profit and assets for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018.

It also includes manufacturer cash discounts. Margin from our generic pharmaceutical program includes price discounts and rebates from manufacturers and may in limited instances include price appreciation. Our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a product, because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time. Margin from distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers is derived from compensation we receive for providing a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers. Our compensation typically is a percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost that is set by manufacturers. In addition, under a limited number of agreements, branded pharmaceutical price appreciation, which is determined by the manufacturers, also serves as part of our compensation. Sourcing Venture with CVS Health Corporation In July 2014, we established Red Oak Sourcing, a U.S.-based generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with CVS with an initial term of 10 years. Red Oak Sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies. Specialty Pharmaceutical Products and Services We refer to products and services offered by our Specialty Solutions division as specialty pharmaceutical products and services. The Specialty Solutions division distributes oncology, rheumatology, urology, nephrology and other pharmaceutical products ("specialty pharmaceutical products") and human- derived plasma products to hospitals, dialysis clinics, physician offices and other healthcare providers provides consulting, patient support, logistics, group purchasing and other services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers primarily supporting the development, marketing and distribution of specialty pharmaceutical products and provides specialty pharmacy services. Our use of the terminology "specialty pharmaceutical products and services" may not be comparable to the terminology used by other industry participants. Medical Segment Our Medical segment manufactures and sources Cardinal Health branded general and specialty medical, surgical and laboratory products and devices. These products include exam and surgical gloves needle, syringe and sharps disposal compression incontinence nutritional delivery wound care cardiovascular and endovascular single-use surgical drapes, gowns and apparel fluid suction and collection systems urology operating room supply and electrode product lines. Our Cardinal Health Brand products are sold directly or through third-party distributors in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and other markets. These products are generally higher-margin products. Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisitions We have acquired a number of businesses over the years that have enhanced our core strategic areas of Cardinal Health Brand medical products, generic pharmaceutical distribution and services, specialty pharmaceutical products and services, international and post-acute care. We expect to continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the future. During the last five fiscal years, we completed the following three large acquisitions: Business 07 17 Patient Recovery Business of Medtronic, plc 10 15 Cordis business of Johnson & Johnson 07 15 The Harvard Drug Group Date Company Location 27 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Mansfield, MA Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis and Nutritional Insufficiency Fremont, CA Cardiovascular and endovascular products Livonia, MI Pharmaceutical product distribution of Business Acquisition (in billions) The Medical segment also distributes a broad range of medical, surgical and laboratory products known as national brand products and provides supply chain services and solutions to hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories and other healthcare providers in the United States and Canada and this segment also assembles and sells sterile and non-sterile procedure kits. Through Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions, this segment also distributes medical products to patients' homes in the United States. We also completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years, including, in fiscal 2017, the acquisition of the North American rights to Lymphoseek, a radiopharmaceutical diagnostic imaging agent, from Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Divestitures Over the past three fiscal years, we have also completed several divestitures. In February 2018, we completed the sale of our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in China to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding Co., Ltd. for proceeds of 861 million (after adjusting for third party indebtedness and preliminary transaction adjustments). In August 2018, we completed the sale of our equity interest in naviHealth, Inc. to investor entities controlled by CD&R for proceeds of 737 million (after adjusting for certain fees and expenses) and a noncontrolling equity interest in a partnership that owned naviHealth. In May 2020, we sold the remainder of our equity interest in naviHealth. We had acquired our equity interest in naviHealth through a series of transactions beginning in fiscal 2016, when we acquired a majority equity interest. Our largest customers, CVS and OptumRx, accounted for 26 percent and 14 percent of our fiscal 2020 revenue, respectively. In the aggregate, our five largest customers, including CVS and OptumRx, accounted for 49 percent of our fiscal 2020 revenue. We have agreements with group purchasing organizations ( GPOs ) that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their We rely on many different suppliers. Products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of 28 percent of our revenue during fiscal 2020, and our largest supplier s products accounted for approximately 6 percent of revenue. Competition We operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and consumer healthcare products. We also operate in a highly competitive environment in the manufacturing and distribution of medical devices and surgical products. We compete on many levels, including price, service offerings, support services, breadth of product lines and product quality and efficacy. In the Pharmaceutical segment, we compete with wholesale distributors with national reach, including McKesson Corporation and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, regional wholesale distributors, self-warehousing chains, specialty distributors, third-party logistics companies, companies that provide specialty pharmaceutical services and nuclear pharmacies, among others. In addition, the At June 30, 2020, we had approximately 30,000 employees in the United States and approximately 18,000 employees outside of the United States. Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect our products, services and intangible assets. We hold patents, and continue to pursue patent protection throughout the world, relating to the manufacture, operation and use of various medical and surgical products, to certain distribution and logistics systems, to the production and distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and to other service offerings. We also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies, and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties. Business Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 28 members. Our two largest GPO relationships in terms of revenue are with Vizient, Inc. and Premier, Inc. Sales to members of these two GPOs, under numerous contracts across our businesses, collectively accounted for 16 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2020. Pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals, including telemarketers. We also compete with manufacturers that sell their products directly. In the Medical segment, we compete with many diversified healthcare companies and national medical product distributors, such as Medline Industries, Inc., Owens & Minor, Inc. and Becton, Dickinson and Company, as well as regional medical product distributors and companies that are focused on specific product categories. We also compete with companies that distribute medical products to patients' homes and third-party logistics companies. We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party. While all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations, we do not consider any particular patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession to be material to our overall business. Regulatory Matters Our business is highly regulated in the United States, at both the federal and state level, and in foreign countries. Depending upon the specific business, we may be subject to regulation by government entities including: the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the DEA ) certain agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, state health departments, insurance departments, Medicaid departments or state boards of pharmacy and other controlled substance authorities the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC ) the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") U.S. Customs and Border Protection and agencies comparable to those listed above in markets outside the United These regulatory agencies have a variety of civil, administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal for failure to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements. They can suspend our ability to manufacture and distribute products, require us to initiate product recalls, seize products or impose criminal, civil and administrative sanctions. Distribution State Boards of Pharmacy, FDA, DEA and various other state authorities regulate the marketing, purchase, storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various federal and state statutes including the federal Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987, Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (the DQSA ), and Controlled Substances Act (the "CSA"). The CSA governs the sale, packaging, storage and distribution of controlled substances. Wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid DEA registrations and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards including effective anti-diversion programs, and comply with the CSA. They must also comply with state requirements relating to controlled substances that differ from state to state. Manufacturing, Sourcing and Marketing We sell our manufactured products in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Latin America and other markets. The FDA and other governmental agencies in the United States, as well as foreign governmental agencies, administer requirements that cover the design, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing (including good manufacturing practices), quality systems, labeling, promotion and advertising (including restrictions on promoting or advertising a product other than for the product's cleared or approved uses), distribution, importation and post-market surveillance for most of our manufactured products. We are also responsible for compliance with Business including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Office of Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights other comparable state agencies 29 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K these requirements when we source certain Medical segment products from third-party manufacturers. We need specific approval or clearance from, and registrations with, regulatory authorities before we can market and sell some products in the United States and certain other countries, including countries in the European Union ("EU"). In the United States, authorization to commercially market a medical device is generally received in one of two ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that a medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval ( PMA ), requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective. Many of our Medical segment branded products are cleared through the 510(k) process and certain products must be approved through the PMA process. In the EU, we are required to comply with the Medical Device Directive ("MDD") and obtain CE Mark Certification in order to market medical devices. In 2017, EU regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation ("MDR") which will replace the MDD when it is implemented in May 2021. Under the MDR, medical devices marketed in the EU will require significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements, except that devices with valid CE Mark issued before May 2020 can be marketed until May 2024. It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain regulatory approvals, clearances and registrations of medical devices, and they might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product or obtain product registrations, the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory oversight, including periodic inspection of manufacturing facilities by FDA and other regulatory authorities both in the United States and internationally. From time to time, we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications, regulatory requirements or published standards. When we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue, we investigate and take appropriate corrective action, which may include recalling the product, correcting the product at the customer location, revising product labeling and notifying customers. For example, in January, 2020, we issued a voluntary recall for 9.1 million AAMI Level 3 surgical gowns and two voluntary field actions (a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs) for 2.9 million Presource Procedure Packs containing affected gowns because one of our FDA-registered suppliers in China had shifted production of some gowns to unapproved sites with uncontrolled environments, resulting in us being unable to assure the sterility of the gowns. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively manufacture, source, market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, please see our Risk Factor entitled "Our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements." Privacy and Data Protection We are subject to various and evolving privacy laws and regulations in many jurisdictions. Because we collect, handle and maintain patient-identifiable health information, we are subject to laws that require specified privacy and security measures and that regulate the use and disclosure of such information, including the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA"), as augmented by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act as well as state laws, in the United States. We also collect, handle, and maintain other sensitive personal and financial information. Within the U.S., these activities are regulated by certain federal and state laws. For example, the new California Consumer Privacy Act became effective in January 2020 and grants specified rights to consumers over the use of their personal information, including increased transparency. Other states are considering adopting similar or different comprehensive privacy laws. Internationally, we are also subject to privacy and data protection laws that require significant compliance efforts, including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) and Japan's Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI), among many others. Nuclear Pharmacies and Related Businesses Our nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities (including for Xofigo) require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations issued by the NRC, applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate, including pharmacy sterile compounding standards and practices. In addition, our radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities also must comply with FDA regulations, including good manufacturing practices. Product Tracing and Supply Chain Integrity Title II of the DQSA, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act or "Track and Trace," establishes a phased-in national system for tracing pharmaceutical products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain to detect, prevent and rapidly respond to the introduction of drugs that may be counterfeit, diverted, stolen, adulterated, subject of a fraudulent transaction or otherwise unfit for distribution. The first phase of implementation began in 2015, and upon full implementation in 2023, we and other supply chain stakeholders will participate in an electronic, interoperable, prescription drug tracing system. In addition, the FDA also has issued regulations requiring most medical device labeling to bear a unique device identifier. These regulations are being phased in through 2020. The MDR, described above, also introduces a new unique device identifier requirement. Business Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 30 Government Healthcare Programs We are subject to U.S. federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws. These laws generally prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order, recommend or purchase products or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other federally-funded healthcare programs. They also prohibit submitting any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government. There are similar state healthcare fraud and abuse laws that apply to Medicaid and other state-funded healthcare programs. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, as well as breach of contract claims and qui tam actions (false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments). Some businesses within each of our segments are Medicare-certified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs, such as state Medicaid programs and the federal 340B drug pricing program. These businesses are subject to accreditation and quality standards and other rules and regulations, including applicable reporting, billing, payment and record-keeping requirements. Other businesses within each segment manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through, or are otherwise governed by, federal or state healthcare programs. Failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements, standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. Our U.S. federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements. Failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work. Environmental, Health and Safety Laws In the United States and other countries, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, including laws regulating the production or use of hazardous substances, as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices. Antitrust Laws The U.S. federal government, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. Violations of these laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages. Laws Relating to Foreign Trade and Operations U.S. and foreign laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods, raw materials and supplies and the handling of information. We also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws, which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties. Similarly, we are subject to U.S. and foreign laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other foreign anti-bribery laws. Among other things, these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. For example, in February 2020, we paid approximately 8.4 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle charges that our internal controls were not sufficient to detect improper payments made by employees of our former China distribution business. Business 31 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Other Information Although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges, our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements. Certain customer contracts require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands, but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels. Business Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 32 Our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees. We only allow customers to return product for credit that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or that can be returned to vendors for credit. We offer market payment terms to our customers. Risk Factors The risks described below could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows. These are not the only risks we face. Our businesses also could be affected by risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial to our operations. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global disruptions on our business and operations discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in the risk factors below, additional or unforeseen effects from the COVID- 19 pandemic and the global economic climate may arise or may amplify many of the risks discussed below. We have been and expect to continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. See the description of the actual and possible effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruptions on our business and operations discussed above in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In addition to the adverse impacts and uncertainties from the COVID-19 pandemic identified there, we face additional possible adverse impacts, including those described below. The cost to manufacture and source certain PPE products has significantly increased, which negatively impacted our margins for these products in fiscal 2020 and is expected to negatively impact our Medical segment profit in fiscal 2021. While we are seeking alternate and additional sources for these products and otherwise seeking to mitigate cost increases, as well as increasing certain PPE product prices to reflect some of our higher costs and seeking to modify affected customer contracts, our segment profit may be adversely impacted more significantly than we expect to the extent these efforts are not successful. In addition, we could experience decreased sales and customer disputes. Federal, state and local government policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 also resulted in the cancellation or deferral of many elective medical procedures and some of our customers closing or severely curtailing their operations. If demand for these procedures does not return, or if these policies remain effective over a sustained period we could experience a greater decrease in sales for the affected products and services than we currently expect. Additionally, sustained changes in the manner in which patients access healthcare may result in shifts in consumer preferences that may not be favorable to us. Political, legal or regulatory actions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in jurisdictions where we manufacture, source or distribute products have created supply disruptions within both our Medical and, currently to a lesser extent, our Pharmaceutical segments and from time to time may cause additional supply disruptions or shortages in the future. We cannot currently predict the frequency, duration or scope of these governmental actions and supply disruptions. For example, several countries, including India and China, have increased or instituted new restrictions on the export of medical or pharmaceutical products that we distribute or use in our businesses, including key components or raw materials. Additionally, Risk Factors 33 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K governmental authorities in many countries, including the U.S., are enacting legislative or regulatory changes to address the impact of the pandemic, which may restrict or require changes in our operations, increase our costs, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operations. As a critical player in the global healthcare supply chain, we participated in industry-wide collaboration with the U.S. government and other distributors intended to increase the availability of PPE in the U.S. In connection with these efforts, we, along with other distributor participants, have received information requests from several members of the U.S. Congress. Also, we may become subject to claims or lawsuits by employees, customers, suppliers or other parties regarding actions we take in our operations in response to the pandemic. Financial hardship to our customers and others could adversely impact the timing and collectability of payments to us from customers and require an increase in reserves against our accounts receivable. We cannot estimate the length or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or the related consequences on the U.S. and global economy and our business and operations, including whether and when normal economic and operating conditions will resume or the extent to which the disruption may impact our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow. The COVID-19 pandemic also may give rise to new risks or heighten many of the risks we have previously identified, including risks associated with competitive pressures, supplier relationships, international operations, regulatory and licensing, changes to the U.S. healthcare environment, cyber security, and access to capital markets. COVID-19 may also adversely affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider a significant risk. We could continue to suffer the adverse effects of competitive pressures. As described in greater detail in the "Business" section, we operate in markets that are highly competitive and dynamic. In addition, competitive pressures in our pharmaceutical and medical segments may be increased by new business models, new entrants, new regulations, changes in consumer demand or general competitive dynamics. Our businesses face continued pricing pressure from these factors, which adversely affects our margins. If we are unable to offset margin reductions caused by these pricing pressures through steps such as sourcing or cost control measures, additional service offerings and sales of higher margin products, our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected. Our Pharmaceutical segment s generic pharmaceutical program may be adversely affected by pricing changes and fewer product launches. The performance of our Pharmaceutical segment s generic pharmaceutical program declined in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 and increased in fiscal 2020. Declines in earlier years were due, in large part, to generic pharmaceutical customer pricing deflation and less incremental benefit from new generic pharmaceutical launches, which more than offset the benefits from sourcing generic pharmaceuticals through our Red Oak Sourcing venture with CVS. If performance of our generic pharmaceutical program declines in future fiscal years and we are unable to offset the decline, our Pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings will be adversely affected. The extent and magnitude of generic pharmaceutical pricing changes is uncertain in future fiscal years and may vary from what we anticipate. Similarly, the number of new generic pharmaceutical launches also varies from year to year, and the margin impact of these launches varies from product to product. Finally, the benefit from Red Oak Sourcing could be less than we anticipate. Changes in manufacturer approaches to pricing branded pharmaceutical products could have an adverse effect on our Pharmaceutical segment s margins. Compensation under our contractual arrangements with manufacturers for the purchase of branded pharmaceutical products is generally based on the wholesale acquisition cost set by the manufacturer. Sales prices of branded pharmaceutical products to our customers generally are a percentage discount from wholesale acquisition cost. Historically, pharmaceutical manufacturers have generally increased the wholesale acquisition cost of their branded pharmaceuticals each year. However, the U.S. government has announced plans to, among other things, adopt policies to encourage manufacturers to limit increases in (or reduce) wholesale acquisition cost. In fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, manufacturers, in the aggregate, increased prices less than in prior years. If manufacturers change their historical approach to setting and increasing wholesale acquisition cost and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services, our Pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings could be adversely affected. Also, almost all of our distribution services agreements with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers generally provide that we receive fees from the manufacturers to compensate us for services we provide them. However, under a limited number of agreements, branded pharmaceutical price appreciation, which is determined by the manufacturers also serves as a part of our compensation. If manufacturers decide to reduce prices, not to increase prices or to implement only small increases and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services, our margins could be adversely affected. The public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and our efforts to resolve related claims could have additional or unexpected material negative effects on our business. Our Pharmaceutical segment distributes prescription opioid pain medications. In recent years, the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication has become a public health crisis. A significant number of states, counties, municipalities and other public plaintiffs, have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical wholesale distributors (including us), Risk Factors Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 34 retail chains and others relating to the manufacturing, marketing or distribution of prescription opioid pain medications and additional public plaintiffs are likely to file similar lawsuits. In addition, we are currently being sued by private plaintiffs, such as unions, other health and welfare funds, hospital systems and other healthcare providers, for the same activities and could be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits. We have also received federal grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with investigations being conducted by the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Eastern District of New York and by the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The subpoenas seek documents and, with respect to the DOJ investigation, testimony relating to our anti-diversion policies and procedures, and our distribution of certain controlled substances. In October 2019, we agreed in principle to a Settlement Framework that would resolve pending and future lawsuits and claims brought by states and political subdivisions. In connection with this development we recorded a pre-tax accrual of 5.56 billion in fiscal 2020. This Settlement Framework is subject to contingencies but is the basis for our negotiation of definitive terms and documentation. Definitive terms of a settlement under the Settlement Framework continue to be negotiated, and there is no assurance that the necessary parties will agree to a definitive settlement agreement or that the contingencies to any agreement will be satisfied. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual. See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information regarding these matters. The defense and resolution of current and future lawsuits and events relating to these lawsuits are subject to uncertainty and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity, or our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our shares, beyond the amounts accrued. In addition, they could have adverse reputational or operational effects on our business. Other legislative, regulatory or industry measures related to the public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and the distribution of these medications could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. For example, several states have now adopted taxes or other fees on the sale of opioids, and several other states have proposed similar legislative initiatives. These laws and proposals vary in the tax amounts imposed and the means of calculation. Liabilities for taxes or assessments under any such laws could have an adverse impact on our results of operations unless we are able to mitigate them through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted. Ongoing unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications, as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits, investigations, regulations and legislative actions, and unfavorable publicity in relation to those lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations. Products that we manufacture, source and market are subject to strict quality and regulatory requirements. The recalls of certain surgical gowns and related Presource Procedure Packs had a negative impact on our financial results in fiscal 2020 and may have additional negative financial and operational impacts. As described in greater detail in the "Business" section, products that we manufacture, source, distribute or market must comply with quality and regulatory requirements. Noncompliance or concerns over noncompliance, including noncompliance by third-party contract manufacturers, may result in suspension of our ability to distribute, import, manufacture or source products, as well as product bans, recalls, safety alerts or seizures, or criminal or civil sanctions, which, in turn, could result in product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions. In addition, it can be costly and time-consuming to obtain regulatory approvals or product registrations to market a medical device or other product, and such approvals or registrations might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. In January, 2020, we issued a voluntary recall for 9.1 million AAMI Level 3 surgical gowns and two voluntary field actions (a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs) for 2.9 million Presource Procedure Packs containing affected gowns (together, the "Recalls") because one of our FDA-registered suppliers in China had shifted production of some gowns to unapproved sites with uncontrolled environments. Because of this, we could not assure sterility of the gowns. In connection with the Recalls, in fiscal year 2020, we recorded a total charge of 85 million, of which 48 million is within cost of products sold and 37 million is within SG&A in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information regarding these matters. In addition, the Recalls may have other negative impacts, which could include government investigations and enforcement actions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or other regulators or U.S. or international governmental bodies, which could possibly result in the suspension or revocation of the authority to produce, distribute and sell products and other civil or criminal sanctions or penalties. Our business is subject to other rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements. In addition to regulatory requirements relating to manufacturing, sourcing and marketing our products described in the Risk Factor immediately above and as described in greater detail in the "Business" section, our business is highly regulated in the United States, at both the federal and state level, and in foreign countries. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements, or if allegations are made that we fail to comply, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. To lawfully operate our businesses, we are required to obtain and hold permits, product registrations, licenses and other regulatory approvals from, and to comply with operating and security standards of, numerous governmental bodies. For example, as a wholesale distributor of controlled substances, we must hold valid DEA registrations and state-level licenses, meet various security and Risk Factors 35 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K operating standards, and comply with the CSA. Failure to maintain or renew necessary permits, product registrations, licenses or approvals, or to comply with required standards, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We collect, handle and maintain patient-identifiable health information and other sensitive personal and financial information which are subject to federal, state and foreign laws that regulate the use and disclosure of such information. Regulations currently in place continue to evolve, and new laws in this area could further restrict our ability to collect, handle and maintain personal or patient information, or could require us to incur additional compliance costs, either of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Violations of federal, state or foreign laws concerning privacy and data protection could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, breach of contract claims, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. We are required to comply with laws relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. The requirements of these laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. From time to time, regulatory authorities investigate our policies or practices, and may challenge them. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions (false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments), which could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of licenses or the ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. Some businesses within each of our segments are Medicare-certified suppliers or participate in other federal and state healthcare programs, such as state Medicaid program and the federal 340B drug pricing program. In addition, some businesses manufacture pharmaceutical or medical products or repackage pharmaceuticals that are purchased or reimbursed through, or are otherwise governed by, federal or state healthcare programs. Failure to comply with applicable eligibility requirements, standards and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the loss of our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. Our government contracts are subject to specific procurement requirements. Failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with contractual or other requirements may result in monetary damages and criminal or civil penalties as well as termination of our government contracts or our suspension or debarment from government contract work. Our global operations are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions and U.S. and foreign export control, trade embargo and customs laws. If we fail to comply, or are alleged to fail to comply, with any of these laws, we could suffer civil or criminal sanctions. For example, in February 2020, we paid approximately 8.4 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle charges that our internal controls were not sufficient to detect improper payments made by employees of our former China distribution business. We could be subject to adverse changes in the tax laws or challenges to our tax positions. We are a large multinational corporation with operations in the United States and many foreign countries. As a result, we are subject to the tax laws of many jurisdictions. From time to time, initiatives are proposed in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate or tax payments. Specific initiatives that may impact us include possible increases in U.S. or foreign corporate income tax rates or other changes in tax law to raise revenue, the repeal of the LIFO (last-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting for income tax purposes, the establishment or increase in taxation at the U.S. state level on the basis of gross revenues, recommendations of the recently completed base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Commission s investigation into illegal state aid. Additionally, in connection with the 5.63 billion pre-tax charge for the opioid litigation, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we recorded a tax benefit of 488 million, which is net of unrecognized tax benefits of 469 million, reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid. We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management's judgment and our current understanding of the Tax Act however, these estimates require significant judgment since the definitive settlement terms and documentation, including provisions related to deductibility, under the Settlement Framework have not been negotiated and the U.S. tax law governing deductibility was changed by the Tax Act. Further, the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the Tax Act or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits. The actual amount of tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" for more information regarding these matters. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2008 through the current fiscal year. Tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations. Tax authorities have challenged some of our tax positions, including IRS challenges to our international transfer pricing for the periods from 2008 to 2014, and it is possible that they will challenge others. These challenges may adversely affect our effective tax rate or tax payments. Changes to the U.S. healthcare environment may not be favorable to us. Over a number of years, the U.S. healthcare industry has undergone significant changes designed to increase access to medical care, improve safety and patient outcomes, contain costs and increase efficiencies. These changes include a general decline in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement levels, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to limit or reduce payments to pharmacies and providers, the basis for payments beginning to transition from a fee-for-service model to value-based payments and risk-sharing models, and the Risk Factors Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 36 industry shifting away from traditional healthcare venues like hospitals and into clinics, physician offices and patients homes. We expect the U.S. healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Possible changes include further reduction or limitations on governmental funding at the state or federal level, efforts by healthcare insurance companies to further limit payments for products and services or changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription pharmaceutical pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits. These possible changes, and the uncertainty surrounding these possible changes, may adversely affect us. Our business and operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems, critical facilities and distribution networks. We rely on our and third-party service providers' information systems for a wide variety of critical operations, including to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to: facilitate the purchase and distribution of inventory items from numerous receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis manage accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers process payments to suppliers facilitate manufacturing and assembly of medical products and generate financial information. Our business also depends on the proper functioning of our and our suppliers' critical facilities, including our national logistics center, and our distribution networks. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our or a service provider's information systems, critical facilities or distribution networks are disrupted (including disruption of access), are damaged or fail, whether due to physical disruptions, such as fire, natural disaster, pandemic or power outage, or due to cyber-security incidents, ransomware or other actions of third parties, including labor strikes, political unrest and terrorist attacks. Manufacturing disruptions also can occur due to regulatory action, production quality deviations, safety issues or raw material shortages or defects, or because a key product or component is manufactured at a single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facilities. From time to time, our businesses perform business process improvements or infrastructure modernizations or use service providers for key systems and processes, such as receiving and processing customer orders, customer service and accounts payable. For example, our Pharmaceutical segment is currently engaged in a multi-year project to implement a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems. If any of these initiatives are not successfully or efficiently implemented or maintained, they could adversely affect our business and our internal control over financial reporting. distribution centers Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience a cyber-attack or other systems breach. Our business relies on the secure transmission, storage and hosting of patient- identifiable health information, financial information and other sensitive protected information relating to our customers, company and workforce. We have programs in place to detect, contain and respond to information security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications developed internally or procured from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties have gained access and will continue to attempt to gain access to our or a service provider's systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deception. We have been the target of cyber attacks, including incidents where certain customer account information was accessed. Although we do not believe these incidents had a material impact on us, similar incidents or events in the future may negatively impact our business, reputation or financial results. Any compromise of our or a service provider's information systems, including unauthorized access to or use or disclosure of sensitive information, could adversely impact our operations, results of operations or our ability to satisfy legal or regulatory requirements, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the new EU general data protection regulation (GDPR) and those related to patient-identifiable health information as further described in the Risk Factor titled Our business is subject to rigorous regulatory and licensing requirements, above. We depend on direct and indirect suppliers to make their products and raw materials available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs and availability of products and raw materials. We depend on others to manufacture some products that we market and distribute. Our operations are also dependent on various components, compounds, raw materials and energy supplied by others. We purchase many of these components, raw materials and energy, and source certain products from numerous suppliers in various countries. In some instances, for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, we procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier. Any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted, become less favorable to us or be terminated and the supply of these components, compounds, raw materials or products could be interrupted or become insufficient. These risks are currently heightened with respect to certain PPE products due to the current and expected future demand for such products. These supply interruptions or other disruptions in manufacturing processes could be caused by events beyond our control, including natural disasters, supplier facility shut-downs, defective raw materials, the impact of epidemics or Risk Factors 37 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K pandemics, such as COVID-19, and actions by U.S. or international governments, including export restrictions or tariffs. In addition, due to the stringent regulatory requirements regarding the manufacture and sourcing of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components, materials or products. A sustained supply reduction or interruption, and an inability to develop alternative and additional sources for such supply, could result in lost sales, increased cost, damage to our reputation, and may have an adverse effect on our business. Our manufacturing businesses use oil-based resins, pulp, cotton, latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products. Prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs. Prices of these commodities are volatile and can fluctuate significantly, causing our costs to produce and distribute our products to fluctuate. Due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations, we may be unable to pass along cost increases through higher prices. If we cannot fully offset cost increases through other cost reductions, or recover these costs through price increases or surcharges, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Changes or uncertainty in U.S. or international trade policies and exposure to economic, political and currency risks, could disrupt our global operations or negatively impact our financial results. We conduct our operations in various regions of the world outside of the United States, including Europe, Asia and Latin America. Global developments can affect our business in many ways. Our global operations are affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession and competition. Additionally, divergent or unfamiliar regulatory systems and labor markets can increase the risks and burdens of operating in numerous countries. Our foreign operations expose us to a number of risks related to trade protection laws, tariffs, excise or other border taxes on goods sourced from certain countries or on the importation or exportation of products or raw materials. Changes or uncertainty in U.S. or international trade policies or tariffs could impact our global operations, as well as our customers and suppliers. We may be required to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we need or to manufacture certain of our products. This could adversely impact our business and results of operations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments, including the U.S., China and India have, or have considered, restrictions on exports of medical and pharmaceutical products. If these restrictions are implemented or not lifted, we may experience a significant disruption in our ability to source pharmaceutical and medical products and could experience increased prices and lost sales. In addition, we conduct our business in U.S. dollars and various functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results, which are reported in U.S. dollars. We may not be able to hedge to protect us against these exposures, and any hedges may not successfully mitigate these exposures. Our sales and credit concentration is significant. CVS is a large customer that generates a significant amount of our revenue. CVS accounted for 26 percent of our fiscal 2020 revenue and 26 percent of our gross trade receivable balance at June 30, 2020. If CVS does not renew our agreements, terminates the agreements due to an alleged default by us, defaults in payment or significantly reduces its purchases from us, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Consolidation in the U.S. healthcare industry may negatively impact our results of operations. In recent years, U.S. healthcare industry participants, including distributors, manufacturers, suppliers, healthcare providers, insurers and pharmacy chains, have consolidated or formed strategic alliances. Consolidations create larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, and also could result in the possible loss of a customer where the combined enterprise selects one distributor from two incumbents. If this consolidation trend continues, it could adversely affect our results of operations. Legal proceedings could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations. Due to the nature of our business, which includes the distribution of controlled substances and other pharmaceutical products and the sourcing, marketing and manufacturing of medical products, we regularly become involved in disputes, litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. For example, we are subject to a number of lawsuits and investigations related to the national health crisis involving the abuse of opioid pain medication as described above in the Risk Factor titled "The public health crisis involving the abuse of prescription opioid pain medication and our efforts to resolve related claims could have additional or unexpected material negative effects on our business" and in Note 7 to the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements." Additionally, some of the products that we distribute or manufacture have been and may in the future be alleged to cause personal injury, subjecting us to product liability claims. For example, we are a defendant in product liability lawsuits that allege personal injuries associated with the use of Cordis OptEase and TrapEase inferior vena cava (IVC) filter products and in lawsuits alleging impurities in the active pharmaceutical ingredients in certain pharmaceutical products. In addition, product liability insurance for these types of claims is becoming more limited and may not be available to us at amounts that we historically have obtained or that we would like to obtain. It is possible that a settlement of or judgment for a product liability claim may not be covered by insurance or exceed available insurance recoveries. If this happens, and if any such settlement or judgment is in excess of any prior accruals, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Patent litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale Risk Factors Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 38 of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if we fail to manage and complete divestitures. We regularly evaluate our portfolio of businesses to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives or whether there may be a more advantaged owner for that business. For example, in the past few years, we divested our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in China and our ownership interest in naviHealth, Inc. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We could also experience greater dis-synergies than expected and the impact of the divestiture on our results of operations could be greater than anticipated. Our ability to manage and complete acquisitions could impact our strategic objectives and financial condition. An important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses. Completion of acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses involve a number of risks, including the following: we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition our management s attention may be diverted to integration efforts we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets we may face difficulties or delays establishing, integrating or combining operations and systems, including manufacturing facilities we may assume liabilities related to legal proceedings involving the acquired business we may face challenges retaining the customers of the acquired business or we may encounter unforeseen internal control, regulatory or compliance issues. We may not realize the expected benefits from planned cost-savings and business improvement initiatives. As a part of an ongoing effort to optimize and simplify our operating model, we expect to transition portions of our finance operations to a global professional services firm and we are making structural changes to certain other functional and commercial areas of our organization as well. Additionally, our Pharmaceutical segment is in a multi-year project to implement a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems. These initiatives, and any similar initiatives identified and implemented in the future, could result in unexpected charges and expenses that negatively impact our financial results and we could fail to achieve the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings. In addition, if we are not able to effectively implement these initiatives, or if they fail to operate as intended, our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected. Additionally, these types of initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of management and employees, business disruption, an inability to attract or retain key personnel, which could negatively affect our business or financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to effectively develop, implement and manage our outsourcing or similar third-party relationships, we may experience operational difficulties and increased costs, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Our goodwill may be further impaired, which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. U.S. GAAP requires us to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, we recorded a 1.4 billion impairment to goodwill within our Medical segment. The testing required by GAAP involves estimates and significant judgments by management. Although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate, any changes in key assumptions, including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates, may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates. It is possible that we may record significant charges related to other reporting units or we may record additional charges in our Medical segment, which charge or charges could adversely affect our results of operations. See "Critical Accounting Policies and Sensitive Accounting Estimates" in MD&A above for more information regarding goodwill impairment testing.

Legal Proceedings In addition to the proceedings described below, the legal proceedings described in Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" are incorporated in this "Legal Proceedings" section by reference. In June 2019, Melissa Cohen, a purported shareholder, filed an action on behalf of Cardinal Health, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio against certain current and former members of our Board of Directors alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to effectively monitor Cardinal Health's distribution of controlled substances. In December 2019 and January 2020, similar complaints were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio by purported shareholders, Stanley M. Malone and Michael Splaine, respectively. In January, 2020, the court consolidated the derivative cases under the caption In re Cardinal Health, Inc. Derivative Litigation and in March 2020, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The amended consolidated derivative complaint seeks, among other things, unspecified money damages against the defendants and an award of attorneys' fees. In June 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.

Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, controls deemed effective now may become inadequate in the future because of changes in conditions, or because compliance with policies or procedures has deteriorated or been circumvented. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria ). Based on management s assessment and the COSO criteria, management believes that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2020. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued a report on our internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP s report appears following this "Management Reports" section and expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Implementation of Business Improvement Initiatives We have certain business improvement initiatives underway that we expect to affect internal control over financial reporting in fiscal year 2021. During fiscal year 2021, as a part of an ongoing effort to optimize and simplify our operating model, we expect to transition portions of our finance operations to a global professional services firm. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical segment is in a multi-year project to implement a replacement of certain finance and operating information systems. If either of these initiatives are not effectively implemented, or fail to operate as intended, it could adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting. 43 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting The Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings (loss), comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (2) and our report dated August 13, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. s Ernst & Young LLP Grandview Heights, Ohio August 13, 2020 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 44 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Cardinal Health, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cardinal Health, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings (loss), comprehensive income (loss), shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 13, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Medical Unit Goodwill Description of the Matter How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 45 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K At June 30, 2020, goodwill related to the Company s Medical segment, including the Medical Unit was 5.7 billion. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. Auditing management s goodwill impairment test for the Medical Unit was challenging because there is significant judgement required in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant judgmental assumptions including the revenue growth rate, gross margin, distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company specific risk premium, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s goodwill impairment review process. For example, we tested controls over management s review of significant judgmental assumptions, including the revenue growth rate, gross margin, distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses, and company specific risk premium, among other assumptions. To test the estimated fair value of the Medical Unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating methodologies used, involving our valuation specialists in testing the significant assumptions described above and testing the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis for completeness and accuracy. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, recent historical performance, changes to the reporting unit s business model, customer base or product mix and other relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. We evaluated the incorporation of the applicable assumptions into the model and tested the model s computational accuracy. In addition, we inspected the Company s reconciliation of the fair value of all reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company and assessed the result. Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 46 Product Liability Lawsuits Description of the Matter How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit As described in Note 1 and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a defendant in various product liability claims in which individuals seek damages associated with the use of Cordis OptEase and TrapEase inferior vena cava (IVC) filter products. The Company accrues for losses and defense costs related to product liability at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The methodology used by the Company to project future Cordis IVC claim costs is based largely on recent experience, including claim filing rates, indemnity severity by claim type, sales data, implant and injury to report lag patterns, and defense costs. The Company periodically reviews such estimates and records adjustments for changes in reserves in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. At June 30, 2020, the Company s product liability reserve balance related to the Cordis IVC lawsuits totaled 468 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries. The Company believes there is a range of estimated losses with respect to these matters. Because no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the Company has accrued the minimum amount in the range. The Company estimates the high end of the range to be approximately 919 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries. Auditing management s accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies related to the Cordis IVC product liability lawsuits was challenging due to the significant judgment required to develop the key assumptions utilized in the model and the nature of information available given the early stages of these lawsuits and the limited claims history. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management s evaluation of the product liability litigation reserve. For example, we tested controls over management s review of the model used to estimate the product liability reserve amount and the significant assumptions as described above used within the model. We also tested management s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the model. To test management s assessment of the probability of occurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable, we evaluated, for example, claims data of the Company, we evaluated the legal letters obtained from internal and external legal counsel, and we discussed with internal and external legal counsel of the plaintiffs claims. Among other procedures we performed to test the measurement of the product liability litigation reserve, we evaluated the method of measuring the reserve for claims including analyses to determine the range of possible losses, obtained and performed audit procedures relative to the analysis, tested the accuracy and completeness of the data, and evaluated new or contrary information affecting the estimate. In addition, we involved internal actuarial specialists to assist with our procedures related to the measurement of the product liability reserve. We have also assessed the adequacy of the Company s disclosures included in Note 7 in relation to these matters. As described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company s unrecognized tax benefits related to its uncertain tax positions were approximately 998 million at June 30, 2020. Uncertain tax positions may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining if the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Auditing management's estimate of the amount of tax benefit related to the Company's uncertain tax positions that qualified for recognition was challenging because management's estimate required significant judgment in evaluating the technical merits of the positions, including interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company s process to assess the technical merits of its uncertain tax positions, including the Company s assessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and management s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions. We involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and national tax professionals in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, where applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company s analysis. For example, we evaluated the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based, and, where applicable, obtained the Company s correspondence with local tax authorities. We used our knowledge of international and local income tax laws, as well as historical settlement activity, where applicable, with local income tax authorities, to evaluate the Company s accounting for its uncertain tax positions. We evaluated developments in the applicable tax jurisdictions to assess potential effects on the Company s positions. We analyzed the Company s assumptions and data used to evaluate the appropriateness of the Company s measurement of tax benefits. We have also evaluated the Company s income tax disclosures in relation to these matters. s Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company's auditor since 2002. Grandview Heights, Ohio August 13, 2020 Opioid Lawsuits Description of the Matter How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit 47 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K As discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is a defendant in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state governments and other political subdivisions related to opioid matters. The Company accrues for losses related to legal matters at the time a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In October 2019, the Company agreed in principal to a global settlement framework (the Settlement Framework ). The Settlement Framework is subject to contingencies and uncertainties as to final terms, however, it is the basis for the Company s negotiation of definitive terms. The Company has accrued 5.56 billion pretax under the cash component of the Settlement Framework as of June 30, 2020 and is unable to reasonably estimate the liability associated with other components. Additionally, management is unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with these matters. Auditing the Company s accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies related to the opioid lawsuits was challenging due to the significant judgment required to evaluate management s assessment of the likelihood of a loss being incurred and management s determination of whether a reasonable estimate of the range of loss can be made. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification and evaluation of this legal contingency. For example, we tested controls over management s review of the assessment of the probability of occurrence of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable and whether the assessment considered all relevant facts. To test the Company s assessment of the probability of a loss and whether the loss was reasonably estimable, among other procedures, we read the Settlement Framework, requested and received internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, met with internal counsel to discuss the status of the proceedings and negotiations of the Settlement Framework, and evaluated the reasonableness of management s assessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable. We also assessed the adequacy and the sufficiency of the Company s disclosures included in Note 7 in relation to these matters.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Cardinal Health, Inc. is a globally integrated healthcare services and products company providing customized solutions for hospitals, healthcare systems, pharmacies, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories and physician offices. We provide medical products and pharmaceuticals and cost-effective solutions that enhance supply chain efficiency. References to we , our and similar pronouns in these consolidated financial statements are to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. Our fiscal year ends on June 30. References to fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 in these consolidated financial statements are to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Basis of Presentation Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority- owned or controlled subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany transactions and amounts have been eliminated. The results of businesses acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition or up to the date of disposal, respectively. Use of Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates, judgments and assumptions are used in the accounting and disclosure related to, among other items, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and reserves, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment, loss contingencies (including product liability and self-insurance accruals), and income taxes. Actual amounts could ultimately differ from these estimated amounts. The outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) has severely impacted, and continues to severely impact the U.S. and global economies, and beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, our businesses have been impacted in a variety of ways. We cannot estimate the length or severity of the COVID- 19 pandemic or the related U.S. and global economic consequences on our business and operations, including whether and when historic economic and operating conditions will resume or the extent to which the disruption may impact our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions related to COVID-19 could ultimately differ over time. Cash Equivalents We consider liquid investments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value. Notes to Financial Statements Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 54 Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 206 million and 193 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. An account is considered past due on the first day after its due date. In accordance with contract terms, we generally have the ability to charge customers service fees or higher prices if an account is considered past due. We regularly monitor past due accounts and establish appropriate reserves to cover potential losses, which are based primarily on historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer. We write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accounts. We provide financing to various customers. Such financing arrangements range from 1 year to 5 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation. Interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned. The financings may be collateralized, guaranteed by third parties or unsecured. Finance notes, net and related accrued interest were 104 million (current portion 12 million) and 103 million (current portion 12 million) at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included in other assets (current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other) in the consolidated balance sheets. Finance notes receivable allowance for doubtful accounts were 27 million and 14 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We estimate an allowance for these financing receivables based on historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer. We write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accounts. Concentrations of Credit Risk We maintain cash depository accounts with major banks, and we invest in high quality, short-term liquid instruments, and in marketable securities. Our short- term liquid instruments mature within three months and we have not historically incurred any related losses. Our trade receivables and finance notes and related accrued interest are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with certain large customers and with customers in the retail and healthcare sectors. Credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures impacting the healthcare industry. With respect to customers in the retail and healthcare sectors, such credit risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base, including its wide geographic dispersion. We perform regular credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and maintain reserves for losses through the established allowance for doubtful accounts. Historically, such losses have been within our expectations. Refer to the "Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts" section within this Note for additional information on the accounting treatment of reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts. Major Customers CVS Health Corporation ("CVS") and OptumRx, are our only customers that individually account for at least 10 percent of revenue and gross trade receivables. These customers are primarily serviced through our Pharmaceutical segment. The following table summarizes historical percent of revenue and gross trade receivables from CVS and OptumRx: We have entered into agreements with group purchasing organizations ( GPOs ) which act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members. Vizient, Inc. and Premier, Inc. are our two largest GPO member relationships in terms of revenue. Sales to members of these two GPOs collectively accounted for 16 percent, 22 percent and 22 percent of revenue for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our trade receivable balances are with individual members of the GPO, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of arrangements. Inventories A substantial portion of our inventories (56 percent at both June 30, 2020 and 2019) are valued at the lower of cost, using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method, or market. These inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities of our Pharmaceutical segment ( distribution facilities ) and are primarily merchandise inventories. The LIFO method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold, so LIFO helps us better match current costs and revenue. We believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the distribution facilities. As such, the LIFO reserve is the difference between (a) inventory at the lower of LIFO cost or market and (b) inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, inventories valued at LIFO cost were 411 million and 230 million higher than the average cost value. We do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost. As such, we did not write-up the value of our inventory from average cost to LIFO cost at June 30, 2020 or 2019. Our remaining inventory that is not valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market is stated at the lower of cost, using the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. Inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 155 million and 171 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience, historical and projected sales trends, specific categories of inventory, age and expiration dates of on-hand inventory and manufacturer return policies. Notes to Financial Statements Percent of Revenue 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 CVS 26% 26% 25% 26% 24% OptumRx 14% 13% 11% 6% 4% 55 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Trade Receivables at June Percent of Gross Cash Discounts Manufacturer cash discounts are recorded as a component of inventory cost and recognized as a reduction of cost of products sold as inventory is sold. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, including finance lease assets which are depreciated over the terms of their respective leases. We generally use the following range of useful lives for our property and equipment categories: buildings and improvements 3 to 39 years machinery and equipment 3 to 20 years and furniture and fixtures 3 to 7 years. We recorded depreciation and amortization expense of 405 million, 455 million and 446 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following table presents the components of property and equipment, net at June 30: Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. Interest on long-term projects is capitalized using a rate that approximates the weighted- average interest rate on long-term obligations, which was 3 percent at June 30, 2020. The amount of capitalized interest was immaterial for all periods presented. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist. Purchased goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Qualitative factors are first assessed to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. There is an option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment for our annual goodwill impairment test in the current year. The quantitative goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the respective carrying amount. Goodwill impairment testing involves judgment, including the identification of reporting units, qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, and, if necessary, the estimation of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit. (in millions) 2020 2019 Land, building and improvements 2,185 1,992 Machinery and equipment 3,008 3,038 Furniture and fixtures 138 138 Accumulated depreciation and amortization (2,965) (2,812) Total property and equipment, at cost 5,331 5,168 Property and equipment, net 2,366 2,356 We have two operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical. These operating segments are comprised of divisions (components), for which discrete financial information is available. Components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units are: Pharmaceutical operating segment (excluding our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division) Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division Medical operating segment (excluding our Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division) ( Medical Unit ) and Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division. Our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions division was formerly referred to as our Nuclear Pharmacy Services division and our Cardinal Health at-Home Solutions division was formerly referred to as our Cardinal Health at Home division. Fair value can be determined using market, income or cost-based approaches. Our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the income-based and market-based approaches. Under the income-based approach, we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods, plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon, are discounted to their present value using an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant, and include an estimate of long-term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts. We use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internally-developed forecasts. Discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 8.5 percent to 10.5 percent. Under the market-based guideline public company method, we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. We also use the guideline transaction method to determine fair value based on pricing multiples derived from the sale of companies that are similar to our reporting units. To further confirm fair value, we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization. Estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including forecasted operating results. The use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment. We performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 and with the exception of our Medical Unit in fiscal 2018, concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. In conjunction with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018, we completed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment test, which we perform annually in the fourth quarter. Using a combination of income and market-based approaches (using a discount rate of 8.5 percent), the carrying value Notes to Financial Statements Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 56 exceeded the fair value and resulted in an impairment charge of 1.4 billion related to our Medical Unit, which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss). Our fair value estimates utilize significant unobservable inputs and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements. The impairment was primarily driven by inventory and cost challenges within our Cordis business which furthered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. This impairment charge did not impact our liquidity, cash flows from operations, or compliance with debt covenants. There was no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment charge. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily IPR&D) involves first assessing qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If so, then a quantitative test is performed to compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the respective asset's carrying amount. Our qualitative evaluation requires the use of estimates and significant judgments and considers the weight of evidence and significance of all identified events and circumstances and most relevant drivers of fair value, both positive and negative, in determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships trademarks, trade names and patents and developed technology, are amortized using a combination of straight-line and accelerated methods based on the expected cash flows from the asset over their estimated useful lives. We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the future forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. Actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts. Assets Held for Sale We classify assets and liabilities (the disposal group ) as held for sale when management commits to a plan to sell the disposal group in its present condition and at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value. We also consider whether an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated and if it is probable that the sale will occur within one year without significant changes to the plan to sell. Upon classification of the disposal group as held for sale, we test the assets for impairment and cease related depreciation and amortization. Investments Investments in non-marketable equity securities are accounted for under the fair value, equity or net asset value method of accounting and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. For equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, we use the fair value measurement alternative and measure the securities at cost less impairment, if any, including adjustments for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For investments in which we can exercise significant influence but do not control, we use the equity method of accounting. Our share of the earnings and losses are recorded in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). We monitor our investments for impairment by considering factors such as the operating performance of the investment and current economic and market conditions. Vendor Reserves In the ordinary course of business, our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other disputes. These disputes are researched and resolved based upon the findings of the research performed. At any given time, there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution. In determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors, we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims. We have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review. Though the claim types are relatively consistent, we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience. The ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require an adjustment. Adjustments to vendor reserves are included in cost of products sold. In addition, the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from period-to- period, timing of settlements and specific vendor issues, such as bankruptcies. Vendor reserves were 77 million and 53 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, excluding third-party returns. See Third-Party Returns section within this Note for a description of third-party returns. Distribution Services Agreement and Other Vendor Fees Our Pharmaceutical segment recognizes fees received from distribution services agreements and other fees received from vendors related to the purchase or distribution of the vendors inventory when those fees have been earned and we are entitled to payment. Since the benefit provided to a vendor is related to the purchase and distribution of the vendor s inventory, we recognize the fees as a reduction in the carrying value of the inventory that generated the fees, and as such, a reduction of cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss) when the inventory is sold. Notes to Financial Statements 57 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Loss Contingencies and Self-Insurance We accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In connection with the opioid litigation as described further in the Note 7, we recorded a pre-tax charge of 5.63 billion ( 5.14 billion after tax) during fiscal 2020. Definitive terms of a settlement under the Settlement Framework continue to be negotiated, and there is no assurance that the necessary parties will agree to a definitive settlement agreement or that the contingencies to any agreement will be satisfied. We develop and periodically update reserve estimates for the Cordis inferior vena cava ("Cordis IVC") claims, including those received to date and expected to be received in the future and related costs. To project future Cordis IVC claim costs, we use a methodology based largely on recent experience, including claim filing rates, estimated indemnity severity by claim type, sales data, implant and injury to report lag patterns and estimated defense costs. We also self-insure for employee healthcare, general liability, certain product liability matters, auto liability, property and workers' compensation. Self- insurance accruals include an estimate for expected settlements or pending claims, defense costs, administrative fees, claim adjustment costs and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies and other liabilities is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies and our self-insurance accruals to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. Any adjustments for changes in reserves are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate occurs. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from these estimates. We recognize these estimated loss contingencies, income from favorable resolution of litigation and certain defense costs in litigation (recoveries) charges in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss). See Note 7 for additional information regarding loss contingencies and product liability lawsuits. Guarantees In the ordinary course of business, we agree to indemnify certain other parties under acquisition and disposition agreements, customer agreements, intellectual property licensing agreements, and other agreements. Such indemnification obligations vary in scope and, when defined, in duration. In many cases, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated, and therefore the overall maximum amount of the liability under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, such indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability. Historically, we have not, individually or in the aggregate, made payments under these indemnification obligations in any material amounts. In certain circumstances, we believe that existing insurance arrangements, subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions, would cover portions of the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations. In addition, we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under these indemnification obligations is not probable. From time to time we enter into agreements that obligate us to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events. Such obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions, where we have agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance measures by the acquired business. Generally, the obligation is capped at an explicit amount. There were no material obligations at June 30, 2020. Income Taxes We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate. We assess the realizability of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that at least a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realizability of deferred tax assets depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods provided for in the tax law for each applicable tax jurisdiction and also considers all available positive and negative evidence. Deferred taxes for non-U.S. liabilities are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. We operate in a complex multinational tax environment and are subject to tax treaty arrangements and transfer pricing guidelines for intercompany transactions that are subject to interpretation. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation. Tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. For tax benefits that do not qualify for recognition, we recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 8 for additional information regarding income taxes. Other Accrued Liabilities Other accrued liabilities represent various current obligations, including certain accrued operating expenses and taxes payable. Noncontrolling Interests Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of net earnings, comprehensive income and net assets that is not attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. Share-Based Compensation Share-based compensation provided to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares. The fair value of stock options is determined on the grant date using a lattice valuation model. The Notes to Financial Statements Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 58 compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate, which may vary over time, of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued. The compensation expense recognized for share- based awards is net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized ratably over the service period of the awards. All income tax effects of share-based awards are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) as awards vest or are settled. We classify share-based compensation expense in distribution, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses to correspond with the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees. If awards are modified in connection with a restructuring activity, the incremental share-based compensation expense is classified in restructuring and employee severance. See Note 14 for additional information regarding share-based compensation. Dividends We paid cash dividends per common share of 1.92, 1.91 and 1.85 in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods or services to customers. Revenue in both segments is primarily related to the distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products, which include both manufactured and sourced products, and we recognize at a point in time when title transfers to customers and we have no further obligation to provide services related to such merchandise. Service revenues are recognized over the period that services are provided to the customer. Revenues derived from services are not material for either segment for all periods presented. We are generally the principal in a transaction, therefore our revenue is primarily recorded on a gross basis. When we are a principal in a transaction, we have determined that we control the ability to direct the use of the product or service prior to transfer to a customer, are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the product or service to our customer, have discretion in establishing prices, and ultimately control the transfer of the product or services provided to the customer. Sales Returns and Allowances Revenue is recorded net of sales returns and allowances. Revenues are measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, discounts, rebates and other variable consideration. Sales returns are recorded based on estimates using historical data. Our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees. We only allow customers to return products for credit in a condition suitable to be added back to inventory and resold at full value ( merchantable product ) or returned to vendors for credit. Product returns are generally consistent throughout the year and typically are not specific to any particular product or customer. We accrue for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon historical customer return trends, margin rates and processing costs. Our accrual for sales returns is reflected as a reduction of revenue and cost of products sold for the sales price and cost, respectively. At both June 30, 2020 and 2019, the accrual for estimated sales returns and allowances was 495 million and 479 million, the impact of which is reflected in trade receivables, net and inventories, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Sales returns and allowances were 2.3 billion, 2.2 billion and 2.4 billion, for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and the net impact on net earnings (loss) in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) was immaterial in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. Third-Party Returns We generally do not accept non-merchantable pharmaceutical product returns from our customers, so many of our customers return non-merchantable pharmaceutical products to the manufacturer through third parties. Since our customers generally do not have a direct relationship with manufacturers, our vendors pass the value of such returns to us (usually in the form of an accounts payable deduction). We, in turn, pass the value received to our customer. In certain instances, we pass the estimated value of the return to our customer prior to our receipt of the value from the vendor. Although we believe we have satisfactory protections, we could be subject to claims from customers or vendors if our administration of this overall process was deficient in some respect or our contractual terms with vendors are in conflict with our contractual terms with our customers. We have maintained reserves for some of these situations based on their nature and our historical experience with their resolution. Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs are primarily included in SG&A expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and include all delivery expenses as well as all costs to prepare the product for shipment to the end customer. Shipping and handling costs were 620 million, 622 million and 543 million, for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Restructuring and Employee Severance Restructuring activities are programs that are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business, such as closing and consolidating facilities, changing the way we manufacture or distribute our products, moving manufacturing of a product to another location, changes in production or business process outsourcing or insourcing, employee severance (including rationalizing headcount or other significant changes in personnel) and realigning operations (including realignment of the management structure in response to changing market conditions). Also included within restructuring and employee severance are employee severance costs that are not incurred in connection with a restructuring activity. See Note 3 for additional information regarding our restructuring activities. Amortization and Other Acquisition-Related Costs We classify certain costs incurred in connection with acquisitions as amortization and other acquisition-related costs in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss). These costs consist of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, transaction costs, integration Notes to Financial Statements 59 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K costs and changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations. Transaction costs are incurred during the initial evaluation of a potential acquisition and primarily relate to costs to analyze, negotiate and consummate the transaction as well as due diligence activities. Integration costs relate to activities required to combine the operations of an acquired enterprise into our operations and, in the case of the Cordis and Patient Recovery businesses, to stand-up the systems and processes needed to support an expanded geographic footprint. We record changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations relating to acquisitions as income or expense in amortization and other acquisition-related costs. See Note 4 for additional information regarding amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Translation of Foreign Currencies Financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are accumulated in shareholders equity through accumulated and other comprehensive loss ("AOCI") utilizing period-end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses of these foreign subsidiaries are translated using average exchange rates during the year. The foreign currency translation gains (losses) included in AOCI at June 30, 2020 and 2019 are presented in Note 11. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses for the period are included in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in the respective financial statement line item. Interest Rate, Currency and Commodity Risk All derivative instruments are recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and all changes in fair value are recognized in net earnings or shareholders equity through AOCI, net of tax. For contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the hedge contracts must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract. Hedge effectiveness is assessed periodically. Any contract not designated as a hedge, or so designated but ineffective, is adjusted to fair value and recognized immediately in net earnings. If a fair value or cash flow hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the contract continues to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled and future adjustments to the contract s fair value are recognized immediately in net earnings. If a forecasted transaction is probable not to occur, amounts previously deferred in AOCI are recognized immediately in net earnings. Interest payments received from the cross currency swap are excluded from the net investment hedge effectiveness assessment and are recorded in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). See Note 10 for additional information regarding our derivative instruments, including the accounting treatment for instruments designated as fair value, cash flow and economic hedges. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon selling an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date. It focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair values are: Level 1 -Observable prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 -Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for Level 3 -Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity See Note 9 for additional information regarding fair value measurements. Recently Adopted Financial Accounting Standards Derivatives and Hedging In October 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued amended accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging which permits the use of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") Overnight Index Swap ("OIS") as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. This guidance was effective beginning the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance that requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet as a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset. The guidance also requires disclosures that meet the objective of enabling financial statement users to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and elected the transition option which allows us to apply the guidance prospectively. The initial adoption in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 resulted in the recognition of lease liabilities in the amount of 422 million and did not have a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or debt covenant compliance under our current debt agreements. The majority of our lease spend relates to certain real estate with the remaining lease spend primarily related to vehicles and equipment. The adoption required certain changes to our systems and processes. See Note 5 for additional information regarding leases. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted Financial Instruments - Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued amended accounting guidance that will require entities to measure credit losses on trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments using an "expected credit loss" model that considers Notes to Financial Statements Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 60 identical assets and liabilities. and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities. historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. This guidance also requires that credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses be recognized as allowances rather than as deductions in the amortized cost of the securities. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 2. Divestitures and Acquisitions Divestitures naviHealth In August 2018, we sold our majority ownership interest in naviHealth, which operated within our Medical segment in exchange for cash proceeds of 737 million (after adjusting for certain fees and expenses) and a noncontrolling equity interest in a partnership that owned naviHealth. We also had certain call rights to reacquire naviHealth. As a result of this divestiture, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we recognized a pre-tax gain of 508 million in impairments and (gain) loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss). This gain included our initial recognition of an equity method investment for 358 million and the derecognition of redeemable noncontrolling interests of 12 million. The fiscal 2019 tax expense as a result of this transaction was 130 million. We determined that the sale of the naviHealth business did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. In May 2020 we sold the remainder of our noncontrolling equity interest in a partnership that owned naviHealth. We recognized a pre-tax gain of 579 million from this disposal in gain on sale of equity interest in naviHealth in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss). Our proportionate share of naviHealth s results, which was recorded in other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss), was income of 2 million and a loss of 10 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. China In February 2018, we sold our pharmaceutical and medical products distribution business in China ("China distribution business") for proceeds of 861 million (after adjusting for third party indebtedness and preliminary transaction adjustments). We determined that the sale of the China distribution business did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. The China distribution business primarily operated within our Pharmaceutical segment, and a smaller portion operated within our Medical segment. During the fiscal year ended 2018, we recognized a pre-tax loss of 41 million related to this divestiture. Acquisitions We did not complete any acquisitions during fiscal 2020. While we completed several small acquisitions during fiscal 2019, the pro forma results of operations and the results of operations for acquired businesses since the acquisition dates have not been separately disclosed because the effects were not significant compared to the consolidated financial statements, individually or in the aggregate. The cash paid for these acquisitions, net of cash acquired was 82 million for fiscal 2019. Patient Recovery Business On July 29, 2017, we acquired the Patient Care, Deep Vein Thrombosis, and Nutritional Insufficiency businesses (the "Patient Recovery Business") from Medtronic plc for 6.1 billion in cash. The acquisition further expanded the Medical segment's portfolio of self-manufactured products. Transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of the Patient Recovery Business were 7 million, 75 million, and 109 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These costs are included in amortization and other acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statement of earnings (loss). 3. Restructuring and Employee Severance The following tables summarize restructuring and employee severance costs: Employee-related costs primarily consist of termination benefits provided to employees who have been involuntarily terminated, duplicate payroll costs and retention bonuses incurred during transition periods. Facility exit and other costs primarily consist of product distribution and lease contract termination costs, lease costs associated with vacant facilities, accelerated depreciation, equipment relocation costs, project consulting fees, vendor transition fees, costs associated with restructuring our delivery of information technology infrastructure services and certain other divestiture-related costs. In fiscal 2020 and 2019, restructuring costs are primarily related to implementation of certain enterprise-wide cost-savings measures. In fiscal 2018, we entered into an agreement to transition the distribution of our Medical segment's surgeon gloves in certain international markets from a third- party distribution arrangement to a direct distribution model. The costs associated with this restructuring included 125 million, on a pre-tax basis, in contract termination costs that were paid during fiscal 2018. These costs are reflected in restructuring and employee severance in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) during the fiscal year ended 2018.

Leases Our operating leases are primarily for corporate offices, distribution facilities, vehicles, and equipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at its inception by evaluating whether the arrangement conveys the right to use an identified asset and whether we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from and have the ability to direct the use of the asset. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Beginning July 1, 2019, operating lease right-of-use assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease expense for operating lease assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate if it is readily determinable. Our lease agreements contain lease components and non-lease components. For all asset classes, we have elected to account for both of these components as a single lease component. We also, from time to time, sublease portions of our real estate property, resulting in sublease income. Sublease income and the related assets and cash flows are not material to the consolidated financial statements at or for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. We also have elected to apply a practical expedient for short-term leases whereby we do not recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset for leases with a term of less than 12 months. Short-term lease expense recognized in fiscal 2020 was not material. In addition, upon adoption of the new lease standard, we elected the package of three practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which include the carry forward of our leases without reassessing 1) whether any contracts are leases or contain leases, 2) lease classification and 3) initial direct costs. Our leases have remaining lease terms from less than 1 year up to approximately 22 years. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain and there is a significant economic incentive to exercise that option. The following table summarizes the components of lease cost: Variable lease cost primarily includes payments for property taxes, maintenance and insurance. Our rental expense relating to operating leases was 153 million and 172 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. (in millions) 2020 Operating lease cost 134 Finance lease cost 13 Variable lease cost 17 Total lease cost 164 The following table summarizes supplemental balance sheet information related to leases at June 30: Operating leases are included in other assets, other accrued liabilities, and deferred income taxes and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, current portion of long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings, and long-term obligations, less current portion in our consolidated balance sheet. The following tables summarizes supplemental cash flow information related to leases: (1) Includes the effect of 22 million from reclassifying deferred rent as an offset to the lease right-of-use asset in accordance with the transition guidance. Our operating leases had a weighted-average remaining lease term of 6.4 years and a weighted-average discount rate of 2.9 percent. Our finance leases had a weighted-average remaining lease term of 4.3 years and a weighted-average discount rate of 2.4 percent .

The future minimum rental payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at June 30, 2019 for fiscal 2020 through 2024 and thereafter were as follows: 126 million, 100 million, 76 million, 54 million, 33 million and 94 million. 6.

Long-Term Debt All the notes represent unsecured obligations of Cardinal Health, Inc. and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The 7.0% Debentures represent unsecured obligations of Allegiance Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary), which Cardinal Health, Inc. has guaranteed. None of these obligations are subject to a sinking fund and the Allegiance obligations are not redeemable prior to maturity. Interest is paid pursuant to the terms of the obligations. These notes are effectively subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries, including trade payables of 21.4 billion. In June 2020, we redeemed 500 million aggregate principle amount of 4.625% Notes due December 2020 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest, plus the make-whole premium applicable to the notes. In connection with the redemption, we recorded a 7 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. During fiscal 2020, we also early repurchased 247 million of the 2.616% Notes due 2022, 11 million of the 3.2% Notes due 2022, 20 million of the Floating Rate Notes due 2022, 104 million of the 3.41% Notes due 2027, 6 million of the 4.6% Notes due 2043, 5 million of the 4.9% Notes due 2045, and 35 million of the 4.368% Notes due 2047. In connection with the early debt repurchases, we recognized a 9 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. In November 2019, we repaid the full principal of the 2.4% Notes due 2019 at maturity for 450 million. The redemption and repurchases were paid for with available cash and other short-term borrowings. In fiscal 2019, we repurchased 67 million of the 2.616% Notes due 2022, 1 million of the 3.2% Notes due 2022, 8 million of the Floating Rate Notes due 2022, and 24 million of the 3.41% Notes due 2027 for a total of 100 million. The repurchases were paid for with available cash. The loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with these early repurchases was immaterial. We also paid off the 1.0 billion 1.948% Notes due 2019 as they became due with available cash. In June 2018, we repaid the full principal of the 1.95% Notes due 2018 at maturity for 550 million. If we undergo a change of control, as defined in the notes, and if the notes receive specified ratings below investment grade by each of Standard & Poors Ratings Services, Moody s Investors Services and Fitch Ratings, any holder of the notes, excluding the debentures, can require with respect to the notes owned by such holder, or we can offer, to repurchase the notes at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. Other Financing Arrangements In addition to cash and equivalents and operating cash flow, other sources of liquidity include a 2.0 billion commercial paper program Notes to Financial Statements Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 64 backed by a 2.0 billion revolving credit facility. We also have a 1.0 billion committed receivables sales facility. In September 2019, we renewed our committed receivables sales facility program through Cardinal Health Funding, LLC ( CHF ) through September 30, 2022. CHF was organized for the sole purpose of buying receivables and selling undivided interests in those receivables to third-party purchasers. Although consolidated with Cardinal Health, Inc. in accordance with GAAP, CHF is a separate legal entity from Cardinal Health, Inc. and from our subsidiary that sells receivables to CHF. CHF is designed to be a special purpose, bankruptcy-remote entity whose assets are available solely to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Our revolving credit and committed receivables sales facilities require us to maintain, as of the end of every fiscal quarter through December 2020, a consolidated net leverage ratio of no more than 4.00-to-1. The maximum permitted ratio will reduce to 3.75-to-1 in March 2021 and as of the end of every quarter thereafter. As of June 30, 2020, we were in compliance with this financial covenant. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, we had no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility however, availability was reduced by outstanding letters of credit of 1 million and 24 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Under our committed receivables sales facility program, we had a maximum amount outstanding of 700 million and an average daily amount outstanding of 12 million during fiscal 2020. We also had no amounts outstanding under the committed receivables sales facility program however, availability was reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit of 29 million and 30 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Under our commercial paper program we had a maximum amount outstanding of 1.7 billion and an average daily amount outstanding of 183 million during fiscal 2020. We had no amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program as of June 30, 2020 and 2019. We also maintain other short-term credit facilities and an unsecured line of credit that allowed for borrowings up to 6 million and 9 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 35 million and 10 million balance of other obligations at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, consisted of short-term borrowings and finance leases. 7. Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Litigation Commitments Generic Sourcing Venture with CVS Health Corporation ("CVS Health") Red Oak Sourcing, LLC ("Red Oak Sourcing") is a U.S.-based generic pharmaceutical sourcing venture with CVS Health for an initial term through June 2024. Red Oak Sourcing negotiates generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of its participants. Due to the achievement of predetermined milestones, we are required to make quarterly payments of 45.6 million to CVS Health for the initial term. Contingencies New York Opioid Stewardship Act In April 2018, the State of New York passed a budget which included the Opioid Stewardship Act (the "OSA"). The OSA created an aggregate 100 million annual assessment on all manufacturers and distributors licensed to sell or distribute opioids in New York. Under the OSA, each licensed manufacturer and distributor would be required to pay a portion of the assessment based on its share of the total morphine milligram equivalents sold or distributed in New York during the applicable calendar year, beginning in 2017. In December 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the OSA is unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement (the "Ruling"). In January 2019, the State filed notice of its intent to appeal the Ruling. In April 2019, the State, among other things, amended the OSA so that the assessment would only cover opioid sales in 2017 and 2018, subject to the State's pending appeal of the Ruling. We accrue contingencies if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be estimated. At June 30, 2020, we have no amounts accrued for the OSA because we do not believe it is probable that a liability has been incurred. Legal Proceedings We become involved from time to time in disputes, litigation and regulatory matters. From time to time, we determine that products we source, manufacture or market do not meet our specifications, regulatory requirements, or published standards. When we or a regulatory agency identify a potential quality or regulatory issue, we investigate and take appropriate corrective action. Such actions have led to product recalls, costs to repair or replace affected products, temporary interruptions in product sales, product liability claims and lawsuits and can lead to action by regulators. Even absent an identified regulatory or quality issue or product recall, we can become subject to product liability claims and lawsuits. From time to time, we become aware through employees, internal audits or other parties of possible compliance matters, such as complaints or concerns relating to accounting, internal accounting controls, financial reporting, auditing, or other ethical matters or relating to compliance with laws such as healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws. When we become aware of such possible compliance matters, we investigate internally and take appropriate corrective action. In addition, from time to time, we receive subpoenas or requests for information from various federal or state agencies relating to our business or to the business of a customer, supplier or other industry participants. Internal investigations, subpoenas or requests for information could directly or indirectly lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us or result in sanctions. We may be named from time to time in qui tam actions initiated by private third parties. In such actions, the private parties purport to act on behalf of federal or state governments, allege that false claims have been submitted for payment by the government and may receive an award if their claims are successful. After a private party has filed Notes to Financial Statements 65 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K a qui tam action, the government must investigate the private party's claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation. These actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination. If the government declines to intervene, the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own purporting to act on behalf of the government. We accrue for contingencies related to disputes, litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates. We recognize income from the favorable outcome of litigation when we receive the associated cash or assets. We recognize estimated loss contingencies for certain litigation and regulatory matters and income from favorable resolution of litigation in litigation (recoveries) charges in our consolidated statements of earnings (loss). Opioid Lawsuits and Investigations Pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, including us, have been named as defendants in over 3,000 lawsuits relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications. The lawsuits seek equitable relief and monetary damages based on a variety of legal theories including various common law claims, such as public nuisance, negligence and unjust enrichment as well as violations of controlled substance laws, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and various other statutes. These lawsuits also name pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacy chains and other entities as defendants. States & Political Subdivisions Approximately 2,800 of these lawsuits have been filed by counties, municipalities, cities and political subdivisions in various federal, state, and other courts. The vast majority of these lawsuits were filed in U.S. federal court and have been transferred for consolidated pre-trial proceedings in a Multi- District Litigation proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (the MDL ). In January 2020, the complaints of Cabell County and City of Huntington, West Virginia were remanded from the MDL to U.S. District Court in West Virginia. A trial date has been set for October 2020. In addition, the complaints of San Francisco, California and the Cherokee Nation have been remanded to their original district courts. In addition, 25 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against distributors, including us, in various state courts. A trial in New York for cases brought by the New York Attorney General and Nassau and Suffolk counties was scheduled to begin in March 2020, but was deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A trial is scheduled to begin in Madison County, Ohio, in October 2020 for the case brought by the Ohio Attorney General. A state court trial in a case brought by certain West Virginia political subdivisions is scheduled for March 2021. Additionally, we have received requests, civil investigative demands, subpoenas or requests for information from additional state attorneys general offices and governmental authorities. In October 2019, we agreed in principle to a global settlement framework with a leadership group of state attorneys general that is designed to resolve all pending and future opioid lawsuits and claims by states and political subdivisions (the "Settlement Framework"). This Settlement Framework is subject to contingencies and uncertainties as to final terms, but is the basis for our negotiation of definitive terms and documentation. The Settlement Framework includes (1) a cash component, pursuant to which we would pay up to 5.56 billion over eighteen years, (2) development and participation in a program for distribution of opioid abuse treatment medications for a period of ten years, and (3) to-be specified industry-wide changes to controlled substance anti-diversion programs. Definitive terms for a settlement pursuant to the Settlement Framework continue to be negotiated, and there is no assurance that the necessary parties will agree to a definitive settlement agreement or that the contingencies to any agreement will be satisfied. In connection with these matters, we have 5.56 billion accrued at June 30, 2020, included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, which represents the cash component. We are unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with these matters. We are unable to reasonably estimate the liability or cost associated with the other components of the Settlement Framework, the potential distribution of treatment medications and any incremental costs for changes to our controlled substance anti-diversion program that we may agree to. In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we along with two other national distributors entered into a 215 million settlement with two Ohio counties, Cuyahoga and Summit, to resolve all claims in the first bellwether trial in the MDL, which had been set for trial for October 2019. In connection with this settlement, we incurred 66 million within litigation (recoveries) charges, net during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. In connection with these matters (including the settlement with two Ohio counties), we recorded a total pre-tax charge of 5.63 billion ( 5.14 billion after tax) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 in litigation (recoveries) charges, net, in the consolidated statement of earnings (loss) for the cash component. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether our accrual is adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual. We continue to strongly dispute the allegations made in these lawsuits and reaching an agreement in principle on a global settlement framework is not an admission of liability or wrongdoing. Private Plaintiffs The Settlement Framework does not address claims by private plaintiffs, which includes unions and other health and welfare funds, hospital systems and other healthcare providers, businesses and Notes to Financial Statements Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 66 individuals. Private plaintiffs had brought approximately 400 lawsuits as of July 28, 2020. Of these, 106 are purported class actions. The causes of action asserted by these plaintiffs are similar to those asserted by public plaintiffs relating to the distribution of controlled substances. We are vigorously defending ourselves in these matters. Department of Justice Investigations We have received federal grand jury subpoenas issued in connection with investigations being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Fraud Section of the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"). The subpoenas seek documents relating to our anti-diversion policies, procedures and program, and our distribution of certain controlled substances. We are cooperating with these requests. Product Liability Lawsuits As of July 28, 2020, we are named as a defendant in 334 product liability lawsuits coordinated in Alameda County Superior Court in California involving claims by approximately 4,280 plaintiffs that allege personal injuries associated with the use of Cordis OptEase and TrapEase inferior vena cava (IVC) filter products. Another 31 lawsuits involving similar claims by approximately 36 plaintiffs are pending in other jurisdictions. These lawsuits seek a variety of remedies, including unspecified monetary damages. We continue to vigorously defend ourselves in these lawsuits and have begun to engage in preliminary resolution discussions with plaintiffs. At June 30, 2020, we had a total of 468 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries, accrued for losses and legal defense costs related to the Cordis IVC filter lawsuits which are presented on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets. We believe there is a range of estimated losses with respect to these matters. Because no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, we have accrued the minimum amount in the range. We estimate the high end of the range to be approximately 919 million, net of estimated insurance recoveries. Shareholder Securities Litigation In August 2019, the Louisiana Sheriffs' Pension & Relief Fund filed a purported class action complaint against Cardinal Health and certain current and former officers and employees in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of our common shares between March 2015 and May 2018. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by making misrepresentations and omissions related to the integration of the Cordis business and inventory and supply chain problems within the Cordis business, and seeks to recover unspecified damages and equitable relief for the alleged misstatements and omissions. In June 2020, the court appointed 1199 SEIU Health Care Employees Pension Fund as lead plaintiff. We believe that the claims asserted in this complaint are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. Surgical Gown Recalls In January 2020, we issued a voluntary recall for 9.1 million AAMI Level 3 surgical gowns and two voluntary field actions (a recall of some packs and a corrective action allowing overlabeling of other packs) for 2.9 million Presource Procedure Packs containing affected gowns (together, the "Recalls"). These Recalls were necessary because we discovered in December 2019 that one of our FDA-registered suppliers in China had shifted production of some gowns to unapproved sites with uncontrolled manufacturing environments. Because of this, we could not assure sterility of the gowns. In connection with these Recalls, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we recorded total charges of 85 million, of which 48 million is within cost of products sold and 37 million is within SG&A in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). This charge represents our best estimate of costs for the Recalls and includes inventory write-off costs and certain remediation and supply disruption costs, such as costs to replace recalled products. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. Other Civil Litigation Generic Pharmaceutical Pricing Antitrust Litigation In December 2019, pharmaceutical distributors including us were added as defendants in a civil class action lawsuit filed by indirect purchasers of generic drugs, such as hospitals and retail pharmacies. The indirect purchaser case is part of a multidistrict litigation consisting of multiple individual class action matters consolidated in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The indirect purchaser plaintiffs allege that pharmaceutical distributors encouraged manufacturers to increase prices, provided anti-competitive pricing information to manufacturers and improperly engaged in customer allocation. We have filed a motion to dismiss the complaints and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in this matter. Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Impurity Litigation Many participants in the pharmaceutical supply chain, including active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") manufacturers, finished dose manufacturers, repackagers (including us), distributors (including us), and retailers have been named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of recalls of certain medications due to alleged impurities in the active pharmaceutical ingredients or finished product. In February 2019, a Multidistrict Litigation was created in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the Sartan MDL ) alleging API impurities in certain generic blood pressure medications. We were recently named as a defendant in a Multidistrict Litigation alleging API impurities in Zantac and its generic form, ranitidine. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these matters. Antitrust Litigation Proceeds We received and recognized income resulting from settlements of lawsuits in which we were a class member or plaintiff of 16 million, 94 million and 22 million during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Income Taxes Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes and Provision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes The following table summarizes earnings (loss) before income taxes: The following table summarizes the components of provision for (benefit from) income taxes: Effective Tax Rate The following table presents a reconciliation of the provision based on the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate: (1) The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 and 2018 represents an income tax benefit tax rate. (2) The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2019 represents an income tax expense tax rate. (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 U.S. operations (4,056) 1,478 391 Non-U.S. operations 284 273 (619) (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Current: Federal 659 295 341 State and local 154 89 41 Non-U.S. 69 85 143 Deferred: Federal (822) (28) (1,003) State and local (127) (37) 16 Non-U.S. (12) (18) (25) 2020 (1) 2019 (2) 2018 (1) Provision at Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 28.1 % State and local income taxes, net of federal benefit 2.5 0.9 (16.0) Tax effect of foreign operations (0.7) (48.4) Nondeductible nontaxable items (0.1) 2.5 (10.2) Goodwill impairment (124.7) Tax Act 0.1 (0.8) 410.9 Change in valuation allowances 1.5 4.5 (76.9) Foreign tax credits 0.5 (1.0) 27.3 China tax related to divestiture (25.8) Legal entity reorganization (3.6) 71.4 Opioid litigation (23.2) Other (0.2) (0.7) (21.9) Earnings (loss) before income taxes (3,772) 1,751 (228) Total current 882 469 525 Total deferred (961) (83) (1,012) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes (79) 386 (487) Effective income tax rate 2.1 % 22.1 % 213.8 % The income tax benefit rate was 2.1% and 213.8% in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2018 compared to an income tax expense rate of 22.1% in fiscal 2019. Fluctuations in the effective tax rates are primarily due to the impact of opioid litigation in fiscal 2020 and the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Act") in fiscal 2018, both described further below, as well as the Medical Unit goodwill impairment in fiscal 2018, as described in Note 1. There were also changes in valuation allowances related to capital losses, credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards in U.S. federal, U.S. state and international jurisdictions. In connection with the 5.63 billion pre-tax charge for the opioid litigation, we recorded a tax benefit of 488 million in fiscal 2020, which is net of unrecognized tax benefits of 469 million, reflecting our current assessment of the estimated future deductibility of the amount that may be paid. We have made reasonable estimates and recorded amounts based on management's judgment and our current understanding of the tax law however, these estimates require significant judgment since the definitive settlement terms and documentation, including provisions related to deductibility, under the Settlement Framework have not been negotiated and the U.S. tax law governing deductibility was changed by the Tax Act. Further, it is possible that the tax authorities could challenge our interpretation of the currently enacted tax law or the estimates and assumptions used to assess the future deductibility of these benefits. The actual amount of the tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions may differ materially from these estimates. See Note 7 for more information regarding these matters. Our effective tax rate has benefits from negotiated lower than statutory tax rates in select foreign jurisdictions which individually are not material to our effective tax rate but in aggregate have a favorable tax impact of approximately 17 million during fiscal 2020. On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected fiscal 2018 and incrementally affected our fiscal year 2019 financial results in several ways. First, the U.S. statutory tax rate in fiscal 2019 was reduced to 21.0%. Second, the Tax Act established new tax provisions that affected us beginning July 1, 2018 including, (1) eliminating the U.S. manufacturing deduction (2) establishing new limitations on deductible interest expense and certain executive compensation (3) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (4) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (5) creating a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-tax income ( GILTI ) and allow for a deduction related to foreign derived intangible income ("FDII") (6) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries and (7) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Regarding the new GILTI tax rules, we elected to treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred. As of June 30, 2020, foreign earnings of approximately 800 million are considered indefinitely reinvested for working capital and other offshore investment needs. The computation of tax required if those earnings are repatriated is not practicable. For amounts not Notes to Financial Statements Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 68 considered indefinitely reinvested, we have recorded an immaterial amount of income tax expense in our financial statements in fiscal 2020. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes. The following table presents the components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at June 30: Deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the preceding table, after netting by taxing jurisdiction and for uncertain tax positions, are in the following captions in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30: (1) Included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. (2) Included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. At June 30, 2020 we had gross federal, state and international loss and credit carryforwards of 123 million, 2.4 billion and 2.2 billion, respectively, the tax effect of which is an aggregate deferred tax asset of 589 million. Substantially all of these carryforwards are available for at least three years. Approximately 461 million of the valuation allowance at June 30, 2020 applies to certain federal, state and international loss carryforwards that, in our opinion, are more likely than not to expire unutilized. However, to the extent that tax benefits related to these carryforwards are realized in the future, the reduction in the valuation allowance would reduce income tax expense. (in millions) 2020 2019 Deferred income tax assets: Receivable basis difference 39 35 Accrued liabilities 607 133 Share-based compensation 38 39 Loss and tax credit carryforwards 589 621 Deferred tax assets related to uncertain tax positions 52 30 Other 87 6 Valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets (470) (542) Deferred income tax liabilities: Inventory basis differences (1,083) (1,056) Property-related (327) (171) Goodwill and other intangibles (751) (808) Total deferred income tax liabilities (2,161) (2,035) (in millions) 2020 2019 Noncurrent deferred income tax asset (1) 39 36 Noncurrent deferred income tax liability (2) (1,258) (1,749) Total deferred income tax assets 1,412 864 Net deferred income tax assets 942 322 Net deferred income tax liability (1,219) (1,713) Net deferred income tax liability (1,219) (1,713) Unrecognized Tax Benefits We had 998 million, 456 million and 423 million of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 balances include 753 million, 303 million and 262 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would have an impact on the effective tax rate. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility. Recognition of these tax benefits would not affect our effective tax rate. We include the full amount of unrecognized tax benefits in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits: (1) Included in fiscal 2018 additions for tax positions of prior years is 110 million related to exposures acquired as part of the Patient Recovery Business for which we are fully indemnified. Also for fiscal 2018 are settlements of 81 million related to the Patient Recovery Business as well as 11 million of statute expirations. It is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months due to activities of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or other taxing authorities, possible settlement of audit issues, reassessment of existing unrecognized tax benefits or the expiration of statutes of limitations. We estimate that the range of the possible change in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months is a net decrease of 0 million to 370 million, exclusive of penalties and interest. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. At June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we had 146 million, 122 million and 110 million, respectively, accrued for the payment of interest and penalties. These balances are gross amounts before any tax benefits and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 we recognized 16 million, 8 million, and 8 million of expense for interest and penalties in income tax expense, respectively. Other Tax Matters We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, we are subject to audit by taxing authorities for fiscal years 2008 through the current fiscal year. We are a party to a tax matters agreement with CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion"), which has been acquired by Becton, Dickinson and Company. Under the tax matters agreement, Notes to Financial Statements (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Balance at beginning of fiscal year 456 423 417 Additions for tax positions of the current year 500 24 15 Additions for tax positions of prior years (1) 78 39 141 Reductions for tax positions of prior years (27) (5) (40) Settlements with tax authorities (1) (6) (25) (99) Expiration of the statute of limitations (1) (3) (11) 69 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Balance at end of fiscal year 998 456 423 CareFusion is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes prior to our fiscal 2010 spin-off of CareFusion. The indemnification receivable was 176 million and 165 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. As a result of the acquisition of the Patient Recovery Business, Medtronic plc is obligated to indemnify us for certain tax exposures and transaction taxes related to periods prior to the acquisition under the purchase agreement. The indemnification receivable was 19 million and 22 million at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 9. Fair Value Measurements The following tables present the fair values for assets and (liabilities) measured on a recurring basis at June 30: (1) The other investments balance includes investments in mutual funds, which are used to offset fluctuations in deferred compensation liabilities. These mutual funds invest in the equity securities of companies with both large and small market capitalization and high- quality fixed income debt securities. The fair value of these investments is determined using quoted market prices. (2) The fair value of interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts, net investment hedges and commodity contracts is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved, including non-performance risk, and using discount rates appropriate for the respective maturities. Observable Level 2 inputs are used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows. The fair value of these derivative contracts, which are subject to master netting arrangements under certain circumstances, is presented on a gross basis in prepaid expenses and other, other assets, other accrued liabilities, and deferred income taxes and other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets. 10. Financial Instruments We utilize derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to certain risks related to our ongoing operations. The primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments include interest rate risk, currency exchange risk, and commodity price risk. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. While the majority of our derivative instruments are designated as hedging instruments, we also enter into derivative instruments that are designed to hedge a risk, but are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative instruments are adjusted to current fair value through earnings at the end of each period. We are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative instruments. Accordingly, we have established and maintain strict counterparty credit guidelines and only enter into derivative instruments with major financial institutions that are rated investment grade or better. We do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty and we believe (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Cash equivalents 721 721 Other investments (1) 114 114 Forward contracts (2) 53 53 (in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets: Cash equivalents 297 297 Other investments (1) 118 118 Forward contracts (2) 53 53 the risk of loss is remote. Additionally, we do not require collateral under these agreements. Interest Rate Risk Management We are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. Our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on cash flows and the market value of our borrowings. We utilize a mix of debt maturities along with both fixed- rate and variable-rate debt to manage changes in interest rates. In addition, we enter into interest rate swaps to further manage our exposure to interest rate variations related to our borrowings and to lower our overall borrowing costs. Currency Exchange Risk Management We conduct business in several major international currencies and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. Our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on business operations. Accordingly, we enter into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities, commitments and anticipated foreign currency revenue and expenses. Commodity Price Risk Management We are exposed to changes in the price of certain commodities. Our objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with forecasted purchases of these commodities to allow management to focus its attention on business operations. Accordingly, we enter into derivative contracts when possible to manage the price risk associated with certain forecasted purchases. The following table summarizes the fair value of our assets and liabilities related to derivatives designated as hedging instruments and the respective line items in which they were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at June 30: (1) Included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. (2) Included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets. (3) Included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. (4) Included in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Fair Value Hedges We enter into pay-floating interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt resulting from fluctuations in interest Notes to Financial Statements (in millions) 2020 2019 Assets: Pay-floating interest rate swaps (1) 27 46 Cross-currency swap (1) 47 12 Foreign currency contracts (2) 6 Liabilities: Pay-floating interest rate swaps (3) 6 Foreign currency contracts (4) 4 2 Forward interest rate swaps (3) 16 Commodity contracts (4) 1 3 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 70 Total assets 74 64 Total liabilities 21 11 rates. These contracts are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Accordingly, the gain or loss recorded on the pay-floating interest rate swaps is directly offset by the change in fair value of the underlying debt. Both the derivative instrument and the underlying debt are adjusted to market value at the end of each period with any resulting gain or loss recorded in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). During fiscal 2020 and 2019, there was no gain or loss recorded to interest expense as changes in the market value of our derivative instruments offset changes in the market value of the underlying debt. In May 2020, we unwound certain interest rate swap contracts. In connection with the unwind of these contracts, we received cash proceeds of 112 million. The related gain will be recognized in interest expense, net in our statement of earnings (loss) over the remaining term of the related debt agreements, which ranged from 48 months to 63 months at June 30, 2020. In connection with the debt repayment as described in Note 6, two pay-floating interest rate swaps with notional amounts of 200 million matured in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2019, we terminated notional amounts of 163 million of pay- floating interest rate swaps in connection with the debt repurchases in fiscal 2019 described in Note 6. These swaps were previously designated as fair value hedges. During fiscal 2018 we entered into pay-floating interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of 1.1 billion. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges of our fixed rate debt and are included in deferred income taxes and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2018, 550 million of pay-floating interest rate swaps matured. The following tables summarize the outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges at June 30: The following table summarizes the gain (loss) recognized in earnings for interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: (1) Included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). Cash Flow Hedges We enter into derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price fluctuations associated with certain forecasted (in millions) Notional Amount Maturity Date Pay-floating interest rate swaps 550 Mar 2023 (in millions) Notional Amount Maturity Date Pay-floating interest rate swaps 2,150 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Pay-floating interest rate swaps (1) 106 9 11 Fixed-rate debt (1) (106) (9) (11) Nov 2019 - Sep 2025 transactions. These derivative instruments are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During fiscal 2020, we entered into forward interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 200 million to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, future transactions associated with our debt. All gains and losses currently included within accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with our cash flow hedges that are expected to be reclassified into net earnings within the next 12 months are immaterial. We enter into foreign currency contracts to protect the value of anticipated foreign currency revenues and expenses. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, we held contracts to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, revenue and expenses. The principal currencies hedged are the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, euro, Thai baht, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Australian dollar, and British pound. We enter into commodity contracts to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of certain commodities used in our Medical segment. The following tables summarize the outstanding cash flow hedges at June 30: The following table summarizes the pre-tax gain (loss) included in OCI for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges: The following table summarizes the pre-tax gain (loss) reclassified from AOCI into earnings for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges: (1) Included in revenue in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).

(3) Included in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). (4) Included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). Net Investment Hedges We hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we enter into cross- currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. In August 2019, we entered into a 64 billion ( 600 million) cross-currency swap maturing in 2022. In September 2018, we entered into a 200 million ( 233 million) cross- currency swap maturing in 2023. Cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are marked-to- market using the current spot exchange rate as of the end of the period, with gains and losses included in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investments. To the extent the cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges are not highly effective, changes in carrying value attributable to the change in spot rates are recorded in earnings. Pre-tax gain from net investment hedges recorded in other foreign currency translation was 35 million and 12 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gain recognized in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) for the portion of the net investment hedges excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness was 17 million and 5 million during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Economic (Non-Designated) Hedges We enter into foreign currency contracts to manage our foreign exchange exposure related to sales transactions, intercompany financing transactions and other balance sheet items subject to revaluation that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, these derivative instruments are adjusted to current market value at the end of each period through earnings. The gain or loss recorded on these instruments is substantially offset by the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability. The settlement of the derivative instrument and the remeasurement adjustment on the foreign currency denominated asset or liability are both recorded in other (income) expense, net. The principal currency managed through foreign currency contracts is the euro, Canadian dollar, British pound, Japanese yen, and Chinese renminbi.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of cash and equivalents, trade receivables, net, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities at June 30, 2020 and 2019 approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings compared to the respective carrying amounts at June 30: The fair value of our long-term obligations and other short-term borrowings is estimated based on either the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or other inputs derived from available market information, which represents a Level 2 measurement. The following table is a summary of the fair value gain (loss) of our derivative instruments based upon the estimated amount that we would receive (or pay), considering counter-party credit risk, to terminate the contracts at June 30: 11.

Only Class A common shares were outstanding at June 30, 2020 and 2019. We repurchased 1.5 billion of our common shares, in the aggregate, through share repurchase programs during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, as described below. We funded the repurchases with available cash and short term borrowings. The common shares repurchased are held in treasury to be used for general corporate purposes. During fiscal 2020, we repurchased 7.3 million common shares having an aggregate cost of 350 million. The average price paid per common share was 48.00. These repurchases were made under an accelerated share repurchase ("ASR") program, which began on August 20, 2019 and was completed on December 4, 2019. During fiscal 2019, we repurchased 11.5 million common shares having an aggregate cost of 600 million. The average price paid per common share was 52.32. These repurchases were made under ASR program, which began on August 16, 2018 and was completed on October 25, 2018.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. The following table reconciles the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc.: The potentially dilutive employee stock options, restricted share units and performance share units that were anti-dilutive for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 6 million, 7 million and 6 million, respectively. During fiscal 2020, there were 2 million potentially dilutive employee stock options, restricted share units and performance share units not included in the computation of diluted loss per common share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc. because their effect would be anti-dilutive as a result of the net loss for the fiscal year. 13. Segment Information Our operations are principally managed on a products and services basis and are comprised of two operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments: Pharmaceutical and Medical. The factors for determining the reportable segments include the manner in which management evaluates performance for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance combined with the nature of the individual business activities. Revenue Our Pharmaceutical segment distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and over-the-counter healthcare and consumer products in the United States. This segment also provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers for specialty pharmaceutical products operates pharmacies, including pharmacies in community health centers, nuclear pharmacies and radiopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities provides pharmacy management services to hospitals as well as medication therapy management and patient outcomes services to hospitals, other healthcare providers and payers and repackages generic pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter healthcare products. Our Medical segment manufactures, sources and distributes Cardinal Health branded medical, surgical and laboratory products, which are sold in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and other markets. In addition to distributing Cardinal Health branded products, Notes to Financial Statements (in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Net earnings (loss) (3,693) 1,365 259 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest (3) (2) (3) Weighted-average common shares basic 293 300 313 Effect of dilutive securities: Employee stock options, restricted share units, and performance share units 1 2 Basic earnings (loss) per common share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc.: (12.61) 4.55 0.82 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc.: (12.61) 4.53 0.81 Weighted-average common shares diluted 293 301 315 73 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Net earnings (loss) attributable to Cardinal Health, Inc.

Segment profit is segment revenue, less segment cost of products sold, less segment distribution, selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses. Segment SG&A expenses include share-based compensation expense as well as allocated corporate expenses for shared functions, including corporate management, corporate finance, financial and customer care shared services, human resources, information technology, legal and compliance, including certain litigation defense costs. Corporate expenses are allocated to the segments based on headcount, level of benefit provided and other ratable allocation methodologies. The results attributable to noncontrolling interests are recorded within segment profit. We do not allocate the following items to our segments: last-in first-out, or ("LIFO"), inventory charges (credits) surgical gown recall costs state opioid assessment related to prior fiscal years restructuring and employee severance amortization and other acquisition-related costs impairments and (gain) loss on disposal of assets litigation (recoveries) charges, net other (income) expense, net interest expense, net loss on early extinguishment of debt gain on sale of equity interest in naviHealth and provision for (benefit from) income taxes. In addition, certain investment spending, certain portions of enterprise-wide incentive compensation and other spending are not allocated to the segments. Investment spending generally includes the first-year spend for certain projects that require incremental investments in the form of additional operating expenses. Because approval for these projects is dependent on executive management, we retain these expenses at Corporate. Investment spending within Corporate was 69 million, 55 million and 43 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In connection with the opioid litigation as discussed further in Note 7, we recognized a pre-tax charge of 5.63 billion during fiscal 2020 which was retained at Corporate. In connection with the surgical gown recall as discussed further in Note 7, we recognized a pre-tax charge of 85 million during fiscal 2020 which was retained at Corporate. In connection with the naviHealth divestiture discussed in Note 2, we recognized a pre-tax gain of 508 million during fiscal 2019 which was retained at Corporate. In connection with the sale of our remaining equity interest in a partnership that owned naviHealth as discussed in Note 2, we recognized a 579 million pre-tax gain ( 493 million after tax) during fiscal 2020, which is included in gain on sale of equity interest naviHealth in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and did not impact segment profit or operating earnings.

Share-Based Compensation We maintain stock incentive plans (collectively, the Plans ) for the benefit of certain of our officers, directors and employees. At June 30, 2020, 12 million shares remain available for future grants under the Amended Cardinal Health, Inc. 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("2011 LTIP"). Under the 2011 LTIP's fungible share counting provisions, stock options are counted against the plan as one share for every share issued awards other than stock options are counted against the plan as two and one-half shares for every share issued. This means that only 5 million shares could be issued under awards other than stock options while 12 million shares could be issued under stock options. Shares are issued out of treasury shares when stock options are exercised and when restricted share units and performance share units vest. The following table provides total share-based compensation expense by type of award: The total tax benefit related to share-based compensation was 16 million, 16 million and 23 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Restricted Share Units Restricted share units granted under the Plans generally vest in equal annual installments over three years. Restricted share units accrue cash dividend equivalents that are payable upon vesting of the awards. The following table summarizes all transactions related to restricted share units under the Plans: Notes to Financial Statements (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Restricted share unit expense 70 63 73 Employee stock option expense 3 10 22 Performance share unit expense 17 9 (10) (in millions, except per share amounts) Nonvested at June 30, 2018 2 71.58 Granted 2 50.13 Vested (1) 74.52 Canceled and forfeited (1) 62.32 Nonvested at June 30, 2019 2 51.65 Granted 2 42.71 Vested (1) 60.21 Canceled and forfeited Nonvested at June 30, 2020 3 45.92 75 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K Total share-based compensation expense 90 82 85 Restricted Share Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share The following table provides additional data related to restricted share unit activity: Stock Options Employee stock options granted under the Plans generally vest in equal annual installments over three years and are exercisable for a period up to ten years from the grant date. All stock options are exercisable at a price equal to the market value of the common shares underlying the option on the grant date.

The fair values were estimated on the grant date using a lattice valuation model. We believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account individual exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables, and it provides for a range of input assumptions, which are disclosed in the table below. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of the grant. We analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model. The expected life of the options granted was calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant (up to ten years). There were no stock options granted to employees during fiscal year 2020 or 2019. The following table provides the range of assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options: Notes to Financial Statements (in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding options at period end 12 10 13 Aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options at period end 12 10 13 Aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options 8 1 14 Net proceeds (withholding) from share-based compensation 26 3 (3) Excess tax benefits from share based compensation 6 7 10 Total compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock options not yet recognized, pre-tax 1 5 17 Total fair value of shares vested during the year 8 20 19 Weighted-average grant date fair value per stock option 8.26 8.34 13.50 (in years) 2020 2019 2018 Weighted-average remaining contractual life of outstanding options 5 5 7 Weighted-average remaining contractual life of exercisable options 5 5 5 Weighted-average period over which stock option compensation cost is expected to be recognized 1 1 2 Cardinal Health Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K 76 Risk-free interest rate 2.1% Expected volatility 25% Dividend yield 2.7% - 2.8% Expected life in years 7 Performance Share Units Performance share units generally vest over a three-year performance period based on achievement of specific performance goals. Based on the extent to which the targets are achieved, vested shares may range from zero to 240 percent of the target award amount. Performance share units accrue cash dividend equivalents that are payable upon vesting of the awards. The following table summarizes all transactions related to performance share units under the Plans (based on target award amounts): The following table provides additional data related to performance share unit activity: Employee Retirement Savings Plans Substantially all of our domestic non-union employees are eligible to be enrolled in our company-sponsored contributory retirement savings plans, which include features under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and provide for matching and discretionary contributions by us.

BUSINESS General The registrant was incorporated on December 28, 2017 as a British Virgin Islands Company with limited liability. The registrant was incorporated as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Following the Business Combination (as described and defined below) in October 2019, the registrant changed its name from Greenland Acquisition Corporation to Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation ( Greenland ). Greenland serves as the parent Company for the primary operating Company, Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited, a holding Company formed under the laws of Hong Kong on April 23, 2009 ( Zhongchai Holding ). Through Zhongchai Holding and other subsidiaries, Greenland develops and manufactures traditional transmission products for material handling machineries in the People s Republic of China (PRC), as well as develops electric industrial vehicles, which are expected to be produced in the near future. Greenland, through its subsidiaries, is: a leading developer and manufacturer of transmission products for material handling machineries in China and since December 2020, a developer of electric industrial vehicles, with our first model of electric industrial vehicle expected to be available in the third or fourth quarter of 2021. Greenland s transmission products are key components for forklift trucks, used in manufacturing and logistic applications such as factories, workshops, warehouses, fulfilment centers, shipyards, and seaports. Forklifts play an important role in logistics for many enterprises across different industries in the PRC and around the globe. Generally, industries with the largest demand for forklifts are transportation, warehousing logistics, electrical machinery, and automobile. Greenland has experienced an increase in demand for forklifts in the manufacturing industry in the PRC, as its revenue increased from approximately 52.40 million in the fiscal year of 2019 to 66.86 million in the fiscal year of 2020. The increased revenue of approximately 14.46 million was primarily due to the fact that demand for our products has returned to normal and continued to grow. Based on the revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Greenland believes that it is one of the major developers and manufacturers of transmission products for small and medium-sized forklift trucks in China. Greenland s transmission products are used in 1-ton to 15-tons forklift trucks, some with mechanical shift and some with automatic shift. Greenland sells these transmission products directly to forklift-truck manufacturers. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Greenland sold an aggregate of more than 108,913 and 83,567 sets of transmission products, respectively, to more than 100 forklift manufacturers in the PRC. In December 2020, Greenland launched a new division to focus on the electric industrial vehicle market, a market that Greenland intends to develop to diversify its product offerings. With this new division, Greenland plans to develop and deploy the next generation of industrial vehicles. Greenland plans to establish a new facility on the east coast of the U.S. and start producing electric industrial vehicles between the third and fourth quarter of 2021. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 6 94 Significant Activities since Inception Initial Public Offering On July 27, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering of 4,400,000 units, including a partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 400,000 units. Each unit consists of one ordinary share, no par value, one warrant to purchase one-half of one ordinary share and one right to receive one-tenth of one ordinary share upon the consummation of our initial business combination, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1. Warrants must be exercised in multiples of two warrants, and each two warrants are exercisable for one ordinary share at an exercise price of 11.50 per share. The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of 10.00 per unit, generated 44,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and offering expenses) in gross proceeds. Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of 282,000 units, issued to Greenland Asset Management Corporation (the Sponsor ) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, which generated 2,820,000 in gross proceeds. Business Combination On October 24, 2019, we consummated our business combination with Zhongchai Holding (the Business Combination ) after a special meeting, where the shareholders of Greenland considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt a share exchange agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement ), dated as of July 12, 2019, among (i) Greenland, (ii) Zhongchai Holding, (iii) the Sponsor in the capacity as the purchaser representative (the Purchaser Representative ), and (iv) Cenntro Holding Limited, the sole member of Zhongchai Holding (the Zhongchai Equity Holder or the Seller ). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Greenland acquired from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Zhongchai Holding in exchange for 7,500,000 newly issued ordinary shares, no par value of Greenland, to the Seller (the Exchange Shares ). As a result, the Seller became the controlling shareholder of Greenland, and Zhongchai Holding became a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of Greenland. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by the Share Exchange Agreement, where Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization (the Recapitalization Transaction ) in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) 805, Business Combinations. For accounting and financial reporting purposes, Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer based on the following facts and circumstances: Zhongchai Holding s operations comprise the ongoing operations of the combined entity The officers of the newly combined company consist of Zhongchai Holding s executives, including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel and The former shareholders of Zhongchai Holding own a majority voting interests in the combined entity. As a result of Zhongchai Holding being the accounting acquirer, the financial reports filed with the SEC by the Company subsequent to the Business Combination are prepared as if Zhongchai Holding is the predecessor and legal successor to the Company. The historical operations of Zhongchai Holding are deemed to be those of the Company. Thus, the financial statements included in this report reflect (i) the historical operating results of Zhongchai Holding prior to the Business Combination (ii) the combined results of Zhongchai Holding and Greenland following the Business Combination in October 2019 (iii) the assets and liabilities of Zhongchai Holding at their historical cost, and (iv) Greenland s equity structure for all periods presented. Zhongchai Holding received 7,500,000 shares of Greenland in exchange for all the share capital, which is reflected retroactively to December 31, 2017 and will be utilized for calculating earnings per share in all prior periods. No step-up basis of intangible assets or goodwill was recorded in the Business Combination transaction, which is consistent with the treatment of the transaction as a reverse recapitalization of Zhongchai Holding. Incorporation of Greenland Technologies Corp. On January 14, 2020, Greenland Technologies Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware ( Greenland Tech ). Greenland Tech is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the registrant. We aim to use Green Tech as the US operation site for the Company in order to promote sales of our robotic products for the North American market in the near future. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 7 94 Corporate Structure The following diagram illustrates the current corporate structure of Greenland, including the jurisdiction of formation and ownership interest of each of its subsidiaries. Greenland was incorporated on December 28, 2017 as a British Virgin Islands Company with limited liability. As a result of the consummation of the Business Combination, Greenland serves as the parent Company for Zhongchai Holding. Zhongchai Holding was incorporated in Hong Kong on April 23, 2009. From April 23, 2009 to November 1, 2011, Zhongchai Holding was a subsidiary of Equicap, Inc., a Nevada corporation with its stock quoted on the OTC Markets until July 29, 2011.

In order to expand and diversify existing product offerings, Greenland recently has entered into the electric industry vehicles market, by designing and developing. Transmission products for material handling machineries Transmission Systems. For 14 years, Greenland, along with its subsidiaries, specialized in designing, developing, and manufacturing a wide range of transmission systems for material handling machineries, in particular forklift trucks. The range of the transmission systems covers from one ton to fifteen tons machineries. Most transmission systems contain auto transmission features. This feature allows for easy machine operations. In addition, Greenland provides transmission system for internal combustion powered machineries as well as for electrical powered machineries. Greenland has experienced an increasing demand for electric powered transmission systems. These transmission systems are key components for material handling machinery assembly. To meet this increasing demand, Greenland is able to providing these transmission systems to major forklift truck original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) as well as certain global branded manufacturers. Integrated Powertrain. Greenland has newly designed and developed unique powertrains, which integrates electric motor, speed reduction gearbox, and driving axles into a combined integral module, in order to meet a growing demand for advanced electric forklift trucks. This integrated powertrain will enable the OEMs to significantly shorten design cycle, improve machinery efficiency, and simplify manufacturing process. There is a new trend that OEMs would rather use an integrated powertrain than separate electric motor, speed reduction gearbox, and driving axles, particularly in electric forklift trucks. Currently, Greenland makes two tons to three and a half-tons integrated powertrains for few electric forklift truck OEMs. Greenland is in the process to add more integrated powertrain products for electric forklift truck OEMs with different sizes. Electric Industrial Vehicles (to be launched in third or fourth quarter 2021) There is an increasing demand for electric industrial vehicles where sustainable energies are used in order to reduce air pollutions and lower carbon monoxide emissions. For Greenland, it plans to enter into the electric industrial vehicles market by utilizing its 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 9 94 existing technologies, know-hows, supply chains, and market access. Greenland s teams have been developing 1.8 tons electric loader vehicle (GEL1800) and plans to setup an assembly facility on the east coast of the United States for final assembly. GEL1800 will be our first electric industry vehicle product and will be available in the third or fourth quarter of 2021. Other models, such as models with loading capacity of one and a half tons or five tons are currently under development. Greenland will co-operate with global parts suppliers to utilize their matured supply chain, which will enable it to shorten its development cycle and make quicker market entrance. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 10 94 Competitive Strengths Greenland believes that it is in the right position and the right time to supply a new generation of industrial vehicles that is green, safe, and cost-effective. The following is a summary of Greenland s competitive strengths. Favorable Market Trends Greenland believes that a number of key industry trends in the PRC will continue to benefit Greenland and its subsidiaries and continue to drive its growth, including: Increasingly stringent regulations over carbon emission, which urge market participants to adopt low or zero-emission material handling and construction equipment Increasing demand for a safer work environment and better healthy worker s condition will drive growth of electric material handling equipment or industry vehicle, which generates no exhausts and a low level of noise in operation Increasing labor cost, which accelerates labor substitution with machinery in material handling and logistic activities Strong competitiveness of USA branded products in the USA, in which the next generation of electric industrial vehicle will be assembled and sold Increasing government support for improving efficiency in the PRC s logistics industry, which is a key market for material handling machinery such as forklifts and loaders and Increasing government support for logistic mechanization, including in the form of subsidies. As a result of these favorable industry trends, Greenland believes that it is well-positioned to capitalize on the increasing market demand for transmission products in the PRC as well as on the growing demand for emission-free and labor substitution by electric vehicles in the United States. Well-Developed Manufacturing Capabilities Leading to Higher Efficiency Greenland s well-developed manufacturing process contributes to manufacturing efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Specifically, a combination of modern operational and management systems, advanced manufacturing equipment, experienced manufacturing know-hows, skilled workforce, and flexible manufacturing system allows Greenland to shorten the time to market for its new products. Moreover, the combination allows Greenland to timely adjust its lines of products in anticipation of changes in market demands. Robust Research and Product Development Capabilities Research and product development capabilities have been critical to Greenland s historical growth and current market position. Such capabilities include the following: Strong R&D team. Greenland s research and development team is comprised of more than 69 professionals, or over 10% of Greenland s employees. It is led by Dr. Lei Chen, former professor at The University of Texas Austin, who has many years of experience in research and development in introducing and adopting new technologies. Facilities. Greenland s research and development facilities consist of a transmission technology center and a electric industry vehicle center. The transmission technology center is accredited by the Zhejiang provincial government. The technology center is made up of a product development and design department, a research center, three research departments that focuses on design, application, and manufacturing of internal combustion engines, and a post- doctoral workstation (certified by the PRC Ministry of Human Resource and Social Security). 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 11 94 Strategic Service Network The ability to provide timely after-sales services is critical in building and maintaining a loyal and solid customer base. We have strategically established an after-sales service network in locations with developed economies. For example, the eastern provinces of the PRC generally have significant demand for logistics services. Accordingly, Greenland, through its subsidiaries, has operated an in-house service center and retained service providers that conduct businesses predominantly in these regions. Users of Greenland s products are able to reach the Company through a service line, through which Greenland is able to provide prompt on- site technical services. Experienced Management Team with Successful Track Records Greenland s senior management team is comprised of individuals who have operational experience, market knowledge, international management skill, and technical expertise. In addition, each member of the senior management team has a proven track record in building and turning companies into successful enterprises. Peter Zuguang Wang has served as the sole director of Zhongchai Holding since April 2009 and the chairman of Zhejiang Zhongchai since September 2017. He has over 20 years of experience in technology and management, along with a unique background in research and development, operation, finance and management. Mr. Wang was the co-founder of Unitech Telecom (now a part of UTStarcom, Nasdaq: UTSI). Raymond Z. Wang has served as the Chief Executive Officer of Zhongchai Holding since April 2019. He has more than ten years of management and corporate governance experience, and has served as president and vice president for two international companies and vice chairman of the board for a non-profit organization. Mr. Wang s experience includes warehouse management, logistics modernization, financial management, organizational management, business process optimization, and customer channel acquisition. Jing Jin, Chief Financial Officer, a Certified Public Account, has over 10 years of experience in accounting, budgeting, and financial planning across operations in the PRC and overseas. Prior to August 2019, Mr. Jin has also served as the chief financial officer of Tantech Holdings Ltd. (Nasdaq: TANH). Lei Chen, Chief Scientist, has over 25 years of experience as a scientist in both U.S. and PRC. He is skillful in unconventional solutions by crossing different science and technology disciplines. Dr. Chen has expertise in laser spectroscopy, high-speed data acquisition, atomic and molecular physics, Nanomaterial, software and hardware architecture and design, combustion engine and electrical motor, and livestock husbandry. Dr. Chen s experience and scientific knowledge is valuable to Zhongchai Holding s research and development efforts with respect to transmission products and future robotic products. Customers Greenland, through its subsidiaries, sells most of its products domestically in the PRC. Its customer bases are primarily in the businesses of material handling equipment and forklift trucks. Greenland believes that its customers include some of the leading manufacturers in their respective market segments. Greenland also supplies to the PRC subsidiaries of a number of blue- chip international brands based in Europe and Asia. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Greenland s five largest customers contributed 48.85% and 43.62%, respectively, of its total revenues. In the same periods, Greenland s single largest customer, Hangcha Group, accounted for 21.25% and 14.03%, respectively, of Greenland s total revenue. Greenland sells products to Hangcha Group based on purchase orders submitted to its subsidiary, Zhongchai Holding. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 12 94 Suppliers Greenland purchases its raw materials from various suppliers for use in the manufacture of its products. The key raw materials used to manufacture its products are processed metal-based parts and components, including iron castings and gears, which are purchased from our domestic suppliers in the PRC. Most of our suppliers are located within close proximity to our manufacturing facilities, which reduces our transportation and inventory costs. The prices for iron and steel and other raw materials have historically fluctuated significantly in the PRC, which in turn has affected the Company s business and operation results. Greenland closely monitors changes in raw material prices and seeks to adjust its inventory of raw materials during inflation periods. In addition, Greenland seeks to minimize the impact of fluctuations in raw material prices by adopting bidding processes in its raw material procurement process Greenland also seeks to price its products to reflect the expected fluctuations in raw material prices to the extent possible. However, there can be no assurance that Greenland could precisely estimate any increase in raw material price or pass on such increase to its customer. Production Greenland s products are comprised of a number of major parts and components, including gearbox housing, gears, bearings, oil pumps, gear shafts, hydraulics, and electrical components. The gearbox housing and gears parts are processed in-house at its manufacturing facility in Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province, PRC. Components of such products, in general, are sourced, from third parties, assembled, and integrated to form finished products. The finished products then undergo further adjustments, fine tunings, testing, and quality inspections. At the end of the inspection process and prior to shipment to our warehouses for storage and distribution, the finished products are coated and painted. For the manufacturing of its electric industrial vehicles, Greenland plans to establish a new facility on the east coast of the U.S. and start producing electric industrial vehicles between the third and fourth quarter of 2021. Inventory and Warehousing Greenland undertakes inventory control in order to reduce the risks of under and over-stocking. On average, Greenland typically maintains a 30 days stock piles for production needs. It generally increases its inventories toward the end of the year in order to meet any production demand, in anticipation of any demands increase, from the second quarter of the following year. Furthermore, Greenland maintains higher inventories at year-end because Chinese New Year typically falls in January or February, which affects production and transportation of raw materials. Greenland has installed an enterprise resource planning ( ERP ) system, which provides real-time information about purchases, production schedules, and supplies of the raw materials. The ERP system has substantially improved Greenland s inventory controls, providing the Company with quick access to various data and easy formulation of operating models, and allowing the Company to keep its inventory at an appropriable level to facilitate the manufacturing process. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Company s production significantly decreased during the first quarter of the fiscal year 2020. However, since March 2020, the Company s production has returned to normal, and the Company experienced a substantial increase in production demand in November and December 2020. Research and Development Greenland s research and development team selects research or development projects or both and draws up preliminary project proposals based on various factors, such as industry and market trends, customer feedback, and input from other departments (i.e. finance and manufacturing departments). Greenland s management, including the heads and lead managers of various internal departments, such as sales and marketing and finance departments, as well as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, reviews the preliminary project proposals and its research and development team formulates a final plan for each approved project after considering suggestions and comments by its management. The final plans will include detailed schedules and budgets for the projects. Greenland s finance department monitors budget overruns. Any increase in the original budget must be reviewed and approved by management before the relevant project can continue. Greenland has also focused on research and development with respect to a new electric industrial vehicle. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 13 94 Strategic Growth Opportunity in the Electric Industrial Vehicle Industry Greenland will expand its market presence by entering the electric industrial vehicle industry. With our strategic supply chain partners, we have leveraged our robust research and development capabilities, as well as our industry and market experience to develop a new product line of electric industrial vehicles. By July 2021, Greenland expects to complete its first production-ready model of electric industrial vehicle product. A compact electric loader vehicle with a payload capacity of approximately 1,800 kilograms (or 3,968 lbs.). This new product line of electric industrial vehicles will offer a better return on investment when compared to existing Internal Combustion ( IC ) industrial vehicles by leveraging Greenland s established global supply chain and expertise in the electrification of material handling vehicles. Following the first electric loader product, Greenland intends to expand its product line to other industrial vehicles and sizes. We believe that electric industrial vehicles, which include electric loaders, excavators and forklift trucks, have the following advantages over traditional IC vehicles: Zero carbon emission. Fully electric industrial vehicles are completely emission free leading to less pollution from local usage. In addition, electrical power generation produces less carbon emissions when compared to fossil fuel. This results in a more environmentally friendly and sustainable power source. Lower energy usage and maintenance costs. Electric industrial vehicles offer a significant saving in energy consumption when compared to diesel equipment. Conventional internal combustion power systems require costly routine maintenance that increases with age. Without the need to maintain these internal combustion engines, electric industrial vehicles provide significantly less maintenance costs and less operational downtime resulting in a greater return on investment. Lower level of noise and vibration. Electric vehicles are proven to produce less sound and vibration when compared to internal combustion vehicles due to the lack of complicated transmission components and coolant pumps. The low noise levels of electric industrial vehicles offer new opportunities to businesses such as working at night in urban areas or during the day close to noise-sensitive locations like parks and hospitals. Demand for Better Workplace Safety and New Applications. Conventional excavators and loaders that use internal combustion engines create significant fumes, emissions, noises and vibrations which can harm the health of staff and surrounding residents. These problems can be addressed by the adoption of electric powered equipment which produce zero emissions, low levels of noise and minor vibrations. This creates a safer work environment and new business opportunities for indoor applications. We believe that the electric industrial vehicle market presents a substantial opportunity for Greenland s future business growth: Fast Growing Market. The global construction equipment market is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 3.9% from 2020 to 2025, reaching US 205 billion1. The North American market is projected to exhibit one of the fastest growth rates during the forecast period. Consequently, we believe this growth will increase with the introduction of the United State infrastructure overhaul program. Should the program be implemented, then it will be a powerful driver of growth in the engineering and construction industry that will proliferate the demand for industrial vehicles and equipment. Call for Carbon Emission Reduction. Global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas and carbon emissions continue to grow with proposals such as the current US administration seeking a target of net zero emission by 2050. These strategies will result in government and public support for the adoption of emission zero technologies and equipment across industries thus boosting the demand for eco-friendly electric powered industrial vehicles. As such, we expect that the demand for electric industrial vehicles will increase rapidly. Highly Fragmented and Emerging Market. The electric industrial vehicle market is highly fragmented with few, if any, dominant local market participants. Although a few conventional industrial vehicles and construction equipment makers are in the process of electric products development a majority are years away from product deployment. This is to avoid cannibalization with the mature fossil fuel-powered equipment product lines which results in the lack of incentive to launch the full-electric industrial vehicles at the near term. As a result, with the early mover advantage together with Greenland s strong research and development capability, we believe that Greenland is well positioned to secure a meaningful role in the electric industrial vehicle market. 1 - Marketsandmarkets Nov 2020 Report: Construction Equipment Market by Type (Excavator-Crawler & Mini, Loader- Backhoe, Skid-steer, Wheel, Dozer, Dump Truck, Others), Electric Equipment, Propulsion, Power Output, Application, Rental, Aftertreatment Device and Region - Global Forecast to 2025 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 14 94 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 15 94 High Technology Barriers for New Entrants. To compete in the electric industrial vehicle market, enterprises need a high-level of core technologies and capabilities in order to successfully develop a commercial product. The investment and expertise required create a high barrier of entry for new market players. Greenland s success in the material handling industry and its achievements in research and development milestones gives Greenland the opportunity and the competitive edge to successfully compete in the industrial vehicle market. Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Greenland relies on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, software registration, and trade secret laws to protect its intellectual property rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for third parties to infringe our Company s intellectual property rights. Patents As of December 31, 2020, Greenland held 108 registered patents, with the PRC National Intellectual Property Administration ( CNIPA ), 98 of which are utility patents and 10 of which are invention patents. These patents relate to the manufacturing of products. As of December 31, 2020, Greenland had been granted 2 trademarks registered with the CNIPA. Greenland s intellectual property also includes technical data such as test results and operating data from projects, drawings, designs, and machinery and manufacturing techniques it developed in-house. Sales and Marketing Greenland sells its products in PRC through its sales and marketing teams. To promote Greenland s brand, sales employees also attend trade shows and exhibitions to showcase our products. As of December 31, 2020, Greenland s sales and marketing team consisted of 14 employees. Members of its sales and marketing teams have extensive experience and knowledge in the material handling equipment sector of the manufacturing industry. They are primarily responsible for identifying business opportunities, promoting products, collecting customer feedbacks and market information, bidding for or negotiating orders, and collecting payments. Competition The transmission industry is fragmented and highly competitive in the PRC. Under the current market trend, domestically produced transmissions account for the largest share of the PRC market. International brand manufacturers equipped with better technology and capital resources are also aiming to expand into the PRC. As a result, it is expected that the PRC transmission market will become more competitive. The typical competitive criteria are quality, price, technology, after-sales service, product offering, and performance record. The transmissions market is capital intensive in capital and operating cost. In addition, the manufacturing process requires technical expertise and significant research and development budgets. As a result, companies entering the market must have significant financial and technical resources. Moreover, the time and cost required to establish a proven track record, necessary for general market acceptance, are substantial. An extensive after-sales service network is essential for a Company to gain general market acceptance. Greenland believes that it is able to compete based on its market position, strong research and development capabilities, high quality products, integrated service systems, and strong relationships with its customers.

Law and Regulation Relating to Tax Enterprise Income Tax On March 16, 2007 and December 6, 2007 respectively, the National People s Congress of China and the State Council of the PRC enacted the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC and the Implementation Regulations of Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC (collectively the PRC EIT Law ), both of which became effective on January 1, 2008. The PRC EIT Law imposes a uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25% on all residence enterprises, including foreign-invested enterprises, and terminates most of the tax exemptions, reductions and preferential treatments available under previous tax laws and regulations. However, the PRC EIT Law and its implementation rules permit certain high-technology enterprises strongly supported by the state which hold independent ownership of core intellectual property and simultaneously meet a list of other criteria, financial or non-financial, as stipulated in the Implementation Rules, to enjoy a 15% enterprise income tax rate subject to certain new qualification criteria. The SAT, the PRC Ministry of Science and Technology and the MOF jointly issued the Administrative Rules for the Certification of High and New Technology Enterprise delineating the specific criteria and procedures for high and new technology enterprises certification. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 18 94 Under the PRC EIT Law, enterprises are classified as either resident enterprises or non-resident enterprises. Pursuant to PRC EIT Law and its implementation rules, besides enterprises established within the PRC, enterprises established outside PRC whose de facto management bodies are located in PRC are considered resident enterprises for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate for their global income. According to the implementation rules of the PRC EIT Law, de facto management body refers to a managing body that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the manufacture and business, personnel, accounting and assets of an enterprise. Withholding Tax The PRC EIT Law removes the prior tax exemption and imposes a 10% withholding tax on dividends paid by foreign- invested enterprises to foreign investors. However, for foreign investors whose home countries or regions have signed bilateral tax agreements with PRC, the withholding tax rate may be reduced to as low as 5% depending on the terms of the applicable tax treaty. In accordance with the Arrangement between Mainland PRC and Hong Kong for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income signed on August 21, 2006, the 5% withholding tax rate applies to dividends paid by a PRC Company to a Hong Kong tax resident, provided that the recipient is a Company that holds directly at least 25% of the interest of the PRC Company, otherwise, the applicable withholding tax rate should be 10%. Further, pursuant to the Notice on the Issues concerning the Application of the Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements issued by the SAT on February 20, 2009, the preferential tax rate under the relevant tax treaties shall only apply to a tax resident from the other side that directly holds at least 25% of the interest of a PRC Company for a period of consecutive 12 months prior to receiving the dividends. Value Added Tax The Provisional Regulations of the PRC Concerning Value Added Tax (the VAT Regulations ), was promulgated on December 13, 1993 and amended by the State Council and became effect on November 19, 2017. Under the VAT Regulations and its implementation regulations, value added tax, or the VAT, is imposed on the sales of goods and provision of processing, repair and replacement services within the PRC and the importation of goods into PRC. The VAT standard rate had been 17% of the gross sale price until April 30, 2018, after which date the rate was reduced to 16%. VAT rate was further reduced to 13% starting from April 1, 2019. On April 4, 2018, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued the Circular on Adjustment of VAT Rates, which became effective as of May 1, 2018. According to the Circular on the Adjustment of VAT Rates, relevant VAT rates have been reduced from May 1, 2018, such that VAT rates of 17% and 11% applicable to the taxpayers who have VAT taxable sales activities or imported goods are adjusted to 13% and 9%, respectively. Law and Regulation Relating to Intellectual Property Rights Copyright Law According to the Copyright Law of the PRC, which was amended on February 26, 2010 and became effective on April 1, 2010, Chinese citizens, legal entities or other organizations shall enjoy the copyright in their works, whether published or not, which include works of literature, art, natural sciences, social sciences, engineering and technology, etc. Copyright owners shall enjoy various kinds of rights, including the right of publication, right of authorship and right of reproduction. Patent Law Pursuant to the Patent Law of the PRC which was amended on December 27, 2008 and became effective on October 1, 2009, the patent administration departments of the State Council are responsible for the administration of patents across the nation. The patent administration departments of provincial, autonomous region or municipal governments are responsible for administering patents within their respective jurisdictions. The PRC patent system adopts a first come, first file principle, which means where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who files the application first. To be patentable, invention or utility models must meet three criteria: novelty, inventiveness and practicability. Invention patents are valid for 20 years, while utility model patents and design patents are valid for 10 years, commencing from the date of application. The patentee shall pay annual fees commencing from the year when the parent right is granted. If the patentee does not pay annual fees according to the requirements, the patent will be terminated prior to its expiry. Other person must obtain consent or a proper license from the patent owner to use the patent. Otherwise, the use constitutes an infringement of the patent rights. The infringer must, in accordance with the applicable regulations, undertake to cease the infringement, take remedial action and or pay damages. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 19 94 Trademark Law Pursuant to the Trademark Law of the PRC which was amended on August 30, 2013 and became effective on May 1, 2014, the right to exclusive use of a registered trademark shall be limited to trademarks which have been approved for registration and to commodities for which the use of trademark has been approved.

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF GREENLAND TECHNOLOGIES HOLDING CORPORATION The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relates to the operations and financial condition reported in the consolidated financial statements of the Company thereto, which appear elsewhere in this Report, and should be read in conjunction with such financial statements and related notes included in this Report. Except for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion, as well as other information in this Report, contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections. Actual results and the timing of the events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to many factors, including those discussed in the Forward-Looking Statements set forth elsewhere in this Report. Overview The registrant was incorporated on December 28, 2017 as a British Virgin Islands Company with limited liability. The registrant was incorporated as a blank check Company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Following the Business Combination (as described and defined below) in October 2019, the registrant changed its name from Greenland Acquisition Corporation to Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation ( Greenland ). On July 27, 2018, we consummated our initial public offering of 4,400,000 units, including a partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option in the amount of 400,000 units. Each unit consists of one ordinary share, no par value, one warrant to purchase one-half of one ordinary share, and one right to receive one-tenth of one ordinary share upon the consummation of our initial business combination, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1. Warrants must be exercised in multiples of two warrants, and each two warrants are exercisable for one ordinary share at an exercise price of 11.50 per share. The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of 10.00 per unit, generated 44,000,000 (before underwriting discounts and offering expenses) in gross proceeds. Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed a private placement of 282,000 units, issued to Greenland Asset Management Corporation (the Sponsor ) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC, generated 2,820,000 in gross proceeds. On October 24, 2019, we consummated our business combination with Zhongchai Holding (the Business Combination ) following a special meeting, where the shareholders of Greenland considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt and entered into the Share Exchange Agreement that allowed Greenland to acquire from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Zhongchai Holding in exchange for 7,500,000 newly issued ordinary shares, no par value of Greenland, issued to the Seller. As a result, the Seller became the controlling shareholder of Greenland, and Zhongchai Holding became a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of Greenland. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by a share exchange, wherein Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. In connection with the Business Combination, all the outstanding rights of the Company were converted into 468,200 ordinary shares on a one-tenth (1 10) ordinary share per right basis if holders of the rights elected to convert their rights into the underlying ordinary shares. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 25 94 On December 17, 2019, the Company s warrants, which were trading under the ticker symbol GTECW, were delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market by the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff. On January 14, 2020, Greenland Technologies Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware ( Greenland Tech ). Greenland Tech is the 100% owned subsidiary of the registrant. We aim to use it as the US operation site of the Company and promote sales of our robotic products for the North American market in the near future. Greenland serves as the parent Company for the primary operating Company, Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited, a holding Company formed under the laws of Hong Kong on April 23, 2009 ( Zhongchai Holding ). Through Zhongchai Holding and other subsidiaries, Greenland develops and manufactures traditional transmission products for material handling machineries in the People s Republic of China (PRC), as well as develops electric industrial vehicles, which are expected to be produced in the near future. Greenland, through its subsidiaries, is: a leading developer and manufacturer of transmission products for material handling machineries in China and a developer of electric industrial vehicles, which is expected to be available in the third or fourth quarter of 2021. Greenland s transmission products are key components for forklift trucks, used in manufacturing and logistic applications such as factories, workshops, warehouses, fulfilment centers, shipyards, and seaports. Forklifts play an important role in logistics for many enterprises across different industries in the PRC and around the globe. Generally, industries with the largest demand for forklifts are transportation, warehousing logistics, electrical machinery, and automobile. Greenland has experienced increased demand for forklifts in the manufacturing industry in the PRC, as its revenue increased from approximately 52.40 million in the fiscal year 2019 to approximately 66.86 million in the fiscal year 2020. Based on revenues in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Greenland believes that it is one of the major developers and manufacturers of transmission products for small and medium-sized forklift trucks in PRC. Greenland s transmission products are used in 1-ton to 15-tons forklift trucks, some with mechanical shift and some with automatic shift. Greenland sells these transmission products directly to forklift truck manufacturers. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Greenland sold an aggregate of more than 108,913 and 83,567 sets of transmission products, respectively, to more than 100 forklift manufacturers in the PRC. In December 2020, Greenland launched a new division to focus on the electric industrial vehicle market, a market that Greenland intends to develop to diversify its product offerings. With this new division, Greenland plans to develop and deploy the next generation of industrial vehicles. Greenland plans to establish a new facility on the east coast of the U.S. and start producing electric industrial vehicles between the third and fourth quarter of 2021. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 26 94 Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Our Operations and Financial Performance The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected China and the rest of the world. In an effort to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, China and many other countries have taken precautionary measures, such as imposing travel restrictions, quarantining individuals infected with or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, encouraging or requiring people to work remotely, and canceling public activities, among others. These ongoing measures adversely affected our operations and financial performance in 2020. Specifically, the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected our revenue in the first half of 2020. For example, from February 3, 2020 to the end of February 2020, the Company closed all of its operating offices in Zhejiang Province, including manufactory, in response to the emergency measures imposed by local government. The pandemic also significantly limited suppliers ability to provide low-cost, high-quality merchandise to the Company on a timely basis. Since late March 2020, the Company s business operations have gradually recovered from the negative impacts due to lockdown, and the Company s backlogged orders were mostly processed during the rest of fiscal year 2020, which contributed to an increase in its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Starting from the fourth quarter of 2020, a few waves of COVID-19 infection emerged in various regions of China, and varying levels of restrictions have been reinstated. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our operations and financial performance in the future will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company s PRC subsidiaries were temporary shut down due to local governments mandate until the end of February 2020. Since late March 2020, the Company s business operations have gradually recovered from the negative impacts due to lockdown, and the Company s backlogged orders were mostly processed during the rest of fiscal year 2020, which contributed to an increase in its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to fiscal year 2019. On a RMB basis, revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 increased by approximately 32.8%. Cost of Goods Sold Greenland s cost of goods sold consists primarily of material costs, freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing costs, internal transfer costs, wages, employee compensation, amortization, depreciation and related costs, which are directly attributable to the production of products. The write down of inventory using NRV impairment test is also recorded in cost of goods sold. The total cost of goods sold increased by approximately 14.03 million, or approximately 35.05%, to approximately 54.05 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 40.02 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Cost of goods sold increased due to our increase in sales volume. Gross Profit Greenland s gross profit increased by approximately 0.43 million, or 3.51%, to approximately 12.81 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 12.38 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, Greenland s gross margin was approximately 19.16% and 23.6%, respectively. The increase in gross profit was mainly due to a decrease in procurement costs. Operating Expense Greenland s operating expenses consist of selling expenses, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses Selling Expense Selling expenses mainly include operating expenses such as sales staff payroll, traveling expenses and transportation expenses. Selling expenses increased by 0.40 million or 33.78%, to approximately 1.59 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately 1.19 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of selling expense was primarily due to the increase in sales. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses include management and office staff salaries and employee benefits, depreciation for office facility and office furniture and equipment, travel and entertainment, legal and accounting, consulting fees and other office expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 0.10 million, or approximately 4.50%, to approximately 2.13 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately 2.23 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the additional administrative expenditure incurred. For the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 28 94 Research and Development Expenses R&D expenses consist of R&D personnel compensation, costs of materials used in R&D projects, and depreciation costs for research-related equipment. R&D expenses increased by approximately 0.02 million, or 1.26%, to approximately 2.38 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to approximately 2.36 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Such increase was primarily attributable to a significant increase in the Company s R&D activities during the year ended December 31, 2020. Income from Operations As a result of the foregoing, income from operations for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 6.71 million, an increase of approximately 0.11 million, as compared to the income from operations of approximately 6.60 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Interest Income and Interest Expenses Greenland s interest income was approximately 0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of approximately 0.15 million, or 98.25%, as compared to approximately 0.15 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to the reason that less cash was deposited in banks during the year ended December 31, 2020. Greenland s interest expenses were approximately 0.93 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, a decrease of approximately 0.36 million, or 27.81%, as compared to approximately 1.29 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of our short-term loans for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to those for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other Income Greenland s other income was approximately 1.00 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately 0.28 million, or 39.14%, as compared to approximately 0.72 million of other income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to the growth in ancillary product and service in Zhejiang Zhongchai for the year ended December 31, 2020. Remeasurement Gain from Change in Functional Currency The Company incurred a one-time gain on remeasurement of foreign currency as the result of the Company changing the functional currency of its subsidiary Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited from RMB to USD. The one-time gain, which amounted to approximately 1.94 million, significantly impacted the net result of operations for the Company during the year ended December 31, 2020. Income Taxes Greenland s income tax was approximately 2.27 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, compared to approximately 0.85 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. PRC operating subsidiary, Zhejiang Zhongchai, obtained a high-tech enterprise status near the end of the fiscal year of 2019. Such status enables Zhejiang Zhongchai to enjoy a reduced statutory income tax rate of 15%, rather than the common PRC corporate tax rate of 25%. The high-tech enterprise status is reevaluated by relevant Chinese government agencies every three years. Zhejiang Zhongchai s current high-tech enterprise will be reevaluated near the end of 2022. Greenland s other PRC subsidiaries are subject to different income tax rates. Shengte, the wholly owned subsidiary of Zhejiang Zhongchai, is subject to a 10% income tax rate for small and micro size businesses. Hengyu, the 62.5% owned subsidiary of Zhongchai Holding, is subject to the 25% standard income tax rate. Hangzhou Greenland, the wholly owned subsidiary of Zhongchai Holding, is subject to the 25% standard income tax rate. Greenland is a holding Company registered in the British Virgin Islands and is not subject to tax on income or capital gains under the current British Virgin Islands law. In addition, upon payments of dividend to its shareholders, the Company will not be subject to any British Virgin Islands withholding tax. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 29 94 On January 14, 2020, Greenland established Greenland Tech, its wholly owned subsidiary in the state of Delaware. We aim to use it as the U.S. operation site of our Company and promote sales of our robotic products for the North American market in the near future. Greenland Tech currently does not conduct any business activities. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the 2017 Tax Act. The 2017 Tax Act includes a number of changes in existing tax law impacting businesses, including the transition tax, a one-time deemed repatriation of cumulative undistributed foreign earnings and a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. ASC 740 requires companies to recognize the effect of tax law changes in the period of enactment, accordingly, the effects must be recognized on companies calendar year-end financial statements, even though the effective date for most provisions is January 1, 2018. Since Greenland Tech was established in year 2020, the one-time transition tax did not have any impact on the Company s tax provision and there was no undistributed accumulated earnings and profits as of December 31, 2020. Net Income As a result of the foregoing, net income was approximately 6.37 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of approximately 1.28 million, as compared to a net income of approximately 5.09 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Liquidity and Capital Resources Greenland is a holding Company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries are required to set aside at least 10% of their respective accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds until the total amount set aside reaches 50% of their respective registered capital. Our PRC subsidiaries may also allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to employee welfare and bonus funds at their discretion. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. We have funded working capital and other capital requirements primarily by equity contributions, cash flow from operations, short- term bank loans and bank acceptance notes, and long-term bank loans. Cash is required primarily to purchase raw materials, repay debts and pay salaries, office expenses, income taxes and other operating expenses. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our PRC subsidiary, Zhejiang Zhongchai, has paid off approximately 21.56 million in bank loan, approximately 0.71 million in related parties loan, approximately 5.72 million in third parties loan, and maintained 9.40 million cash on hand. We plan to maintain the current debt structure and rely on governmentally supported loans with lower cost, if necessary. The government subsidy mainly consists of an incentive granted by the Chinese government to encourage transformation of fixed assets in China and other miscellaneous subsidy from the Chinese government. Government subsidies are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the subsidy will be received and all conditions be completed. Total government subsidies recorded under long-term liabilities were 2.34 million and 2.18 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company currently plans to fund its operations mainly through cash flow from its operations, renewal of bank borrowings, additional equity financing, and continuation of financial support from its shareholders and affiliates controlled by its principal shareholders, if necessary. The Company might implement a stricter policy on sales to less creditworthy customers and plans to continue to improve its collection efforts on accounts with outstanding balances. The Company is actively working with customers and suppliers and expects to fully collect the remaining balance. We believe that the Company has sufficient cash, even with uncertainty in the Company s manufacturing and sale of electric industrial vehicles in the future and decline on sale of transmission products. However, our capital contribution from existing funding sources, to operate for the next 12 months will be sufficient. We remain confident and are expected to generate positive cash flow from our operations. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 30 94 We may need additional cash resources in the future, if the Company experiences failure in collecting account receivables, changes in business condition, changes in financial condition, or other developments. We may also need additional cash resources, if the Company wishes to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, strategic cooperation, or other similar actions. If the Company s management and its Board determine that the cash required for specific corporate activities exceed Greenland s cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company may issue debt or equity securities to raise cash. Historically, we have expended considerable resources on building a new factory and paid off a considerable amount of debt, resulting in less available cash. However, we anticipate that our cash flow will continue to improve for the fiscal year 2021. We have completed Zhejiang Zhongchai s new factory construction and the PRC government has provided subsidies to ease the local business-related financing conditions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, we pledged the deed of our new factory as a collateral to banks to obtain additional loans, refinance expiring loans, restructure short-term loans, and fund other working capital needs upon acceptable terms to Greenland. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents refers to all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturity of three months or less. As of December 31, 2020, Greenland had approximately 7.16 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of approximately 5.04 million, or 237.14%, as compared to approximately 2.12 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase of cash was mainly due to the increase of accounts payable and short-term bank loans, as compared to that as of December 31, 2019. Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents the amount held by a bank as security for bank acceptance notes and therefore is not available for use until the bank acceptance notes are fulfilled or expired, which typically takes less than twelve months. As of December 31, 2020, Greenland had approximately 2.24 million of restricted cash, a decrease of approximately 1.35 million, or 37.56%, as compared to approximately 3.59 million as of December 31, 2019. The decrease of restricted cash was due to the increase of mortgaged assets. Accounts Receivable As of December 31, 2020, Greenland had approximately 12.41 million of accounts receivables, an increase of approximately 0.44 million, or 3.65%, as compared to approximately 11.97 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in accounts receivable was due to our slowed-down effort in receivables collections due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Greenland recorded approximately 0.99 million of provision for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020. Greenland conducted an aging analysis of each customer s delinquent payments to determine whether allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. In establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts, Greenland considers historical experience, economic environment, and expected collectability of past due receivables. An estimate of doubtful accounts is recorded when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. When bad debts are identified, such debts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Greenland will continuously assess its potential losses based on the credit history of and relationships with its customers on a regular basis to determine whether its bad debt allowance on its accounts receivables is adequate. Greenland believes that its collection policies are generally in line with the transmissions industry s standard in the PRC. Due from Related Party Due from related party was 38.54 million and 36.47 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The current portion of due from related party was 38.54 million as of December 31, 2020, the non-current portion of due from related party was 0 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect the amount due from our controlling shareholder, Cenntro Holding, to be paid back on April 27, 2022, as mutually agreed by the Company and Cenntro Holding Limited, for an extension of repayment from the end of October 2020 in accordance with the original maturity date. However, there is no guarantee that such amount will be repaid in whole or in part before the end of April 2022, if at all. Such failure to pay back by Cenntro Holding could have a material negative impact on our balance sheet. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 31 94 Notes Receivable As of December 31, 2020, Greenland had approximately 30.80 million of notes receivables, which will be collected by us within twelve months.

Such amounts were further offset by repayment of loans lent by third parties for approximately 5.72 million, and repayment of short-term bank loans for approximately 21.56 million. Net cash used in financing activities was approximately (9.64) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, mainly attributable to approximately 38.67 million proceeds from short-term bank loans and approximately 5.21 million proceeds from long-term payables, offset by repayments of short-term bank loans for approximately (41.14) million, repayments of long-term bank loans for approximately (6.53) million, repayment of loans lent by third parties for approximately (2.90) million, and repayment of loans lent by related parties for approximately (5.43) million. Credit Risk Credit risk is one of the most significant risks for Greenland s business. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and derived from revenues earned from customers, thereby exposing Greenland to credit risk. Credit risk is controlled by the application of credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures. Greenland identifies credit risk collectively based on industry, geography, and customer type. This information is monitored regularly by the Company s management. In measuring the credit risk of sales to customers, Greenland mainly reflects the probability of default by the customer on its contractual obligations and considers the current financial position of the customer and the exposures to the customer and its future development. Liquidity Risk Greenland is exposed to liquidity risk when it is unable to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and or business needs. Liquidity risk is managed by the application of financial position analysis to test if Greenland is in danger of liquidity issues and also by application of monitoring procedures to constantly monitor its conditions and movements. When necessary, Greenland resorts to other financial institutions to obtain additional short-term funding to meet the liquidity shortage. Inflation Risk Greenland is also exposed to inflation risk. Inflationary factors, such as increases in raw material and overhead costs, could impair Greenland s operating results. Although Greenland does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on its ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of sales revenues if the selling prices of its products do not increase with such increased costs. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying accounting principles, it is often required to use estimates. These estimates consider the facts, circumstances and information available, and may be based on subjective inputs, assumptions and information known and unknown to us. Material changes in certain of the estimates that we use could potentially affect, by a material amount, our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Although results may vary, we believe our estimates are reasonable and appropriate. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a summary of our significant accounting policies. The following describes certain of our significant accounting policies that involve more subjective and complex judgments where the effect on our consolidated financial position and operating performance could be material. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 33 94 Revenue Recognition In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenues when goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining when and how revenues are recognized from contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five-step analysis: (i) identification of contract with customer (ii) determination of performance obligations (iii) measurement of the transaction price (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognition of revenues when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company derives revenues from the processing, distribution and sale of its products. The Company recognizes its revenues net of value-added taxes ( VAT ). The Company is subject to VAT which had been levied at the rate of 17% on the invoiced value of sales until April 30, 2018, after which date the rate was reduced to 16%. VAT rate was further reduced to 13% starting from April 1, 2019. Output VAT is borne by customers in addition to the invoiced value of sales and input VAT is borne by the Company in addition to the invoiced value of purchases to the extent not refunded for export sales. Revenues are recognized at a point in time once the Company has determined that the customer has obtained control over the product. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customer when the performance obligation is fulfilled, usually at the time of customers acceptance or consumption, at the net sales price (transaction price) and each of the criteria under ASC 606 have been met. Contract terms may require the Company to deliver the finished goods to the customers location or the customer may pick up the finished goods at the Company s factory. International sales are recognized when shipment clears customs and leaves the port. The Company has adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, using the transition method of Modified-Retrospective Method ( MRM ). The adoption of ASC 606 had no impact on the Company s beginning balance of retained earnings. The Company s contracts are all short-term in nature with a contract term of one year or less. Receivables are recorded when the Company has an unconditional right to consideration. Business Combination On October 24, 2019, we consummated our business combination with Zhongchai Holding (the Business Combination ) following a special meeting, where the shareholders of Greenland considered and approved, among other matters, a proposal to adopt and entered into the Share Exchange Agreement, dated as of July 12, 2019, among (i) Greenland, (ii) Zhongchai Holding, (iii) the Sponsor in the capacity as the purchaser representative (the Purchaser Representative ), and (iv) Cenntro Holding Limited, the sole member of Zhongchai Holding (the Zhongchai Equity Holder or the Seller ). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Greenland acquired from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Zhongchai Holding in exchange for 7,500,000 newly issued ordinary shares, no par value of Greenland, to the Seller (the Exchange Shares ). As a result, the Seller became the controlling shareholder of Greenland, and Zhongchai Holding became a directly and wholly owned subsidiary of Greenland. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse merger effected by a share exchange, wherein Zhongchai Holding is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Pursuant to the Finder Agreement, 50,000 newly issued ordinary shares issued to Zhou Hanyi is the finder fee for business combination. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is based on estimated selling prices less any further costs expected to be incurred for completion and disposal. Cost of raw materials is calculated using the weighted average method and is based on purchase cost. Work-in-progress and finished goods costs are determined using the weighted average method and comprise direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 34 94 Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes following the liability method pursuant to FASB ASC 740 Income Taxes . Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely- than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company also follows FASB ASC 740, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. It is the Company s policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other expense and interest expense, respectively, as necessary. The Company s historical tax years will remain open for examination by the local authorities until the statute of limitations has passed. Emerging growth Company Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an emerging growth Company is provided the option to adopt new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by FASB or the SEC either (i) within the same periods as those otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies or (ii) within the same time periods as private companies. We intend to continue to take advantage of the exemption for complying with new or revised accounting standards within the same time periods as private companies. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you receive from other public companies. We also intend to continue to take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements of emerging growth companies pursuant to the JOBS Act so long as we qualify as an emerging growth Company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls, as under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), defined are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of December 31, 2020, the end of the fiscal year covered by this report, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective. They reached this conclusion due to the presence of material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting as described below. Greenland s management anticipates that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures will remain ineffective until such material weaknesses are remediated. Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such item is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of its management and directors and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, we conducted an evaluation on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on the evaluation under this framework, Greenland s management concluded that the Company s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of the evaluation date due to the following material weakness: The lack of sufficient and competent financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements to prepare consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. Based on the above factors, management concluded that our insufficient knowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC rules represents a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. As a result, the Company has developed a remedial plan to strengthen its accounting and financial reporting functions. To strengthen the Company s internal control over financial reporting, the Company expects to implement the following remedial actions during fiscal year 2021: Developing and formalizing of key accounting and financial reporting policies and procedures Recruiting more financial reporting and accounting personnel who have adequate U.S. GAAP knowledge 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 38 94 Training key position staff by U.S. accountant with U.S. corporate accounting experiences, and gaining additional knowledge and professional skills about SEC regulations and U.S. GAAP Planning to acquire additional resources to strengthen the financial reporting function and set up a financial and system control framework and establishing effective oversight and clarifying reporting requirements for non-recurring and complex transactions to ensure consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are accurate, complete and in compliance with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. Inherent limitation on the effectiveness of internal control The effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, is subject to inherent limitations, including the exercise of judgment in designing, implementing, operating, and evaluating the controls and procedures, and the inability to eliminate misconduct completely. Accordingly, any system of internal control over financial reporting, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, not absolute assurances. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but cannot assure you that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting. Notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Director Independence Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq Listing Rules requires a majority of a listed Company s board of directors to be comprised of independent directors within one year of listing. In addition, the Nasdaq Listing Rules require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed Company s audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent, that audit committee members also satisfy independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and that compensation committee members also satisfy heightened independence requirements contained in the Nasdaq Listing Rules as well as Rule 10C- 1 under the Exchange Act. Under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a) (2), a director will only qualify as an independent director if, in the opinion of our Board, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In order to be considered independent for purposes of 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, a member of an audit committee of a listed Company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the Board, or any other Board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed Company or any of its subsidiaries or otherwise be an affiliated person of the listed Company or any of its subsidiaries. When determining the independence of the members of our compensation committee under the heightened independence requirements contained in the Nasdaq Listing Rules and Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act, our Board is required to consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship with us that is material to that director s ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, but not limited to: (1) the source of compensation of that director, including any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee paid by us to that director and (2) whether that director is affiliated with our Company, a subsidiary of our Company, or an affiliate of a subsidiary of our Company. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 42 94 Our Board has reviewed the composition of our Board and its committees and the independence of each director.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the two-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Emphasis of Matter The Company incurred a one-time gain on remeasurement of foreign currency as the result of the Company changing the functional currency of its subsidiary Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited. The one time gain significantly impacted the net result of operations for the Company during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our audit opinion is not qualified as a result of this emphasis of matter. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to the accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and 2.) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in anyway our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. The critical audit matter related to the Company s fair valuation of the Company s accounts receivables and related allowance for doubtful accounts. The principal considerations in determining that this was a critical audit matter was that this account requires significant subjective judgment and complexity accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts requires estimation and the consideration of historical data, both internal and external, and potential future events. We addressed this critical auditing matter by REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 56 94 testing the reasonableness of the Company s accounting policy, by considering the logic, testing them against the terms within contracts with customers, as well as the Company s assumptions against other similar businesses in the same or comparable industries. We also gathered data from the Company and from external sources, and performed our own independent analysis, and compared our conclusion against the Company s own assessment. The outcome of our testing supports our audit opinion above. We believe that the Company will need to devote resources to regularly revisit and monitor it policies and procedures regarding these accounts given their susceptibility to changes in the general economic climate. The accounts that are affected by these critical matters are account receivables, allowance for doubtful accounts, bad debt expense, and net income, and the related disclosures found in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies Accounts Receivable and Note 4 Accounts Receivable. s WWC, P.C.

The Company was incorporated as a blank check Company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more target businesses. On October 24, 2019, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited via a reverse capitalization and changed its name from Greenland Acquisition Corporation to Greenland Technologies Holding Corporation. Greenland serves as the parent Company for the primary operating Company, Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited, a holding Company formed under the laws of Hong Kong on April 23, 2009 ( Zhongchai Holding ). Through Zhongchai Holding and other subsidiaries, Greenland develops and manufactures traditional transmission products for material handling machineries in PRC, as well as develop models for robotic cargo carriers, which are expected to be produced in the near future in PRC. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus, commonly referred to as COVID-19 , first found in mainland China, then in Asia and eventually throughout the world, has significantly affected business and manufacturing activities within China, including travel restrictions, widespread mandatory quarantines, and suspension of business activities within China. Effective February 3, 2020, the Company announced the temporary closure of its operating offices in Zhejiang Province, including suspension of its manufacturing activities in response to the emergency measures imposed by the local government. The Company s operating subsidiaries were temporary shut down until the end of February 2020. The Company expects to delay its launch of robotic cargo carriers due to uncertainties of the market demand. Moreover, the outbreak has significantly limited suppliers ability to provide low-cost, high- quality parts and materials to the Company on a timely basis. Zhejiang Province, where we conduct a substantial part of our business, is one of the most affected areas in China. As of the date of this report, Chinese industries have gradually resumed businesses as government officials started to ease the restrictive measures since April 2020. However, we remain cautious and prudent when assessing the future impact of COVID-19 on our business due to the current ongoing global pandemic. The Company s Shareholders As of December 31, 2020, Cenntro Holding Limited owns 69.60% of Greenland s outstanding ordinary shares. Cenntro Holding Limited is controlled and beneficially owned by Mr. Peter Zuguang Wang, chairman of the Company.

Restricted Cash Restricted cash represents amounts held by a bank as security for bank acceptance bills, as well as the financial product secured for the short-term bank loan and therefore is not available for the Company s use until such time as the bank acceptance notes and bank loans have been fulfilled or expired, normally within a twelve-month period. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company applies the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to the financial instruments that are required to be carried at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy based upon observable and non-observable inputs that prioritizes the information used to develop our assumptions regarding fair value. Fair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets, that are either directly or indirectly observable and Level 3 defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company s financial instruments primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, accounts payable, other payables and accrued liabilities, short-term bank loans, and notes payable.

The estimated fair values of short-term bank loans were not materially different from their carrying value as presented due to the short maturities and that the interest rates on the borrowing approximate those that would have been available for loans of similar remaining maturity and risk profile. As the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of the fair value, these financial instruments are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are carried at net realizable value. The Company reviews its accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, customer s historical payment history, its current creditworthiness and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection. The Company only grants credit terms to established customers who are deemed to be financially responsible. Credit periods to customers are within 60 days after customers received the purchased goods. If accounts receivable are to be provided for, or written off, they would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations within operating expenses. Balance of allowance of doubtful accounts was 0.99 million and 1.04 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which is based on estimated selling prices less any further costs expected to be incurred for completion and disposal. Cost of raw materials is calculated using the weighted average method and is based on purchase cost. Work-in-progress and finished goods costs are determined using the weighted average method and comprise direct materials, direct labor and an appropriate proportion of overhead. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had reserves for inventories of 0 million and 0.13 million, respectively. The Company records inventory reserves for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about our current and future demand forecasts. Advance to Suppliers Advance to suppliers represents interest-free cash paid in advance to suppliers for purchases of parts and or raw materials. The balance of advance to suppliers was 0.45 million and 0.05 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and include expenditure that substantially increases the useful lives of existing assets. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance, which do not extend the useful life of the assets, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is provided over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives are as follows: Plant, buildings and improvements 20 years Machinery and equipment 2 10 years Motor vehicles 4 years Office equipment 3 5 years Fixtures and decorations 5 years When assets are sold or retired, their costs and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the consolidated financial statements and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is recognized in the period of disposition as an element of other income. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to income as incurred, whereas significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.

Companies or individuals are authorized to possess and use the land only through land use rights granted by the Chinese government. The land use rights granted to the Company are being amortized using the straight-line method over the lease term of fifty years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with FASB ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment . In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition in accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-15. To the extent that estimated future, undiscounted cash inflows attributable to the asset, less estimated future, undiscounted cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal, whether through sale or abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. There was no impairment loss recognized for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Lease ASC 842 supersedes the lease requirements in ASC 840 Leases , and generally requires lessees to recognize operating and finance lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements. Leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks incidental to the ownership of assets are accounted for as finance leases as if there was an acquisition of an asset and incurrence of an obligation at the inception of the lease. All other leases are accounted for as operating leases. A sale-leaseback transaction occurs when an entity sells an asset it owns and immediately leases the asset back from the buyer. The seller then becomes the lessee and the buyer becomes the lessor. under ASC 842, both parties must assess whether the buyer-lessor has obtained control of the asset and a sale has occurred. The Company has determined that the leaseback transaction that it newly entered in current year fails to qualify as a sale because control is not transferred to the buyer-lessor. Therefore, the Company has classified the lease portion of the transaction as a finance lease whereby the Company continues to depreciate the assets and recorded a financing obligation for the consideration received from the buyer-lessor, with an implicit interest rate of 4.0038%. Statutory Reserve In accordance with the PRC Regulations on Enterprises with Foreign Investment, an enterprise established in the PRC with foreign investment is required to provide for certain statutory reserves, namely (i) General Reserve Fund, (ii) Enterprise Expansion Fund and (iii) Staff Welfare and Bonus Fund, which are appropriated from net profit as reported in the enterprise s PRC statutory accounts. A wholly-owned foreign enterprise is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit to the General Reserve Fund until the balance of such fund has reached 50% of its respective registered capital. A non-wholly-owned foreign invested enterprise is permitted to provide for the above allocation at the discretion of its board of directors. Appropriations to the Enterprise Expansion Fund and Staff Welfare and Bonus Fund are at the discretion of the board of directors for all foreign invested enterprises. The aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. Revenue Recognition In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , the Company recognizes revenues when goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining when and how revenues are recognized from contracts with customers, the Company performs the following five-step analysis: (i) identification of contract with customer (ii) determination of performance obligations (iii) measurement of the transaction price (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations and (v) recognition of revenues when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation. The Company derives revenues from the processing, distribution and sale of its products. The Company recognizes its revenues net of value-added taxes ( VAT ).

VAT rate was further reduced to 13% starting from April 1, 2019. Output VAT is borne by customers in addition to the invoiced value of sales and input VAT is borne by the Company in addition to the invoiced value of purchases to the extent not refunded for export sales. 2022 3 2 12:22 https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm https: www.sec.gov Archives edgar data 0001735041 000121390021018961 f10k2020 greenlandtech.htm 71 94 NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Revenues are recognized at a point in time once the Company has determined that the customer has obtained control over the product. Control is typically deemed to have been transferred to the customer when the performance obligation is fulfilled, usually at the time of customers acceptance or consumption, at the net sales price (transaction price) and each of the criteria under ASC 606 have been met. Contract terms may require the Company to deliver the finished goods to the customers location or the customer may pick up the finished goods at the Company s factory. International sales are recognized when shipment clears customs and leaves the port. The Company has adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018, using the transition method of Modified-Retrospective Method ( MRM ). The adoption of ASC 606 had no impact on the Company s beginning balance of retained earnings. The Company s contracts are all short-term in nature with a contract term of one year or less. Receivables are recorded when the Company has an unconditional right to consideration Contracts do not offer any price protection but allow for the return of certain goods if quality problem, which is standard warranty. The Company s product returns and recorded reserve for sales returns were minimal for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The total sales return and warranty expenditures amount are accounting for around 0.71% and 0.54% of the total revenue of Greenland. The following table sets forth disaggregation of revenue: 2020 2019 Major Product Transmission boxes for Forklift 58,407,137 52,140,258 Transmission boxes for Non-Forklift (EV, etc.) 8,457,238 260,586 Total 66,864,375 52,400,844 Cost of Goods Sold Cost of goods sold consists primarily of material costs, freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, internal transfer costs, wages, employee compensation, amortization, depreciation and related costs, which are directly attributable to the production of products. Write-down of inventory to lower of cost or net realizable value is also recorded in cost of goods sold. Selling Expenses Selling expenses include operating expenses such as payroll and traveling and transportation expenses. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses include management and office salaries and employee benefits, depreciation for office facility and office equipment, travel and entertainment, legal and accounting, consulting fees and other office expenses. Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and totaled approximately 2,384,951 and 2,355,307 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Research and development costs are incurred on a project specific basis.

When the subsidy relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income over the periods necessary to match the subsidy on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Where the subsidy relates to an asset, it is recognized as other long-term liabilities and is released to the statement of operations over the expected useful life in a consistent manner with the depreciation method for the relevant asset. Total government subsidies recorded in the other long-term liabilities were 2.34 million and 2.18 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Income Taxes The Company accounts for income taxes following the liability method pursuant to FASB ASC 740 Income Taxes . Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely- than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company also follows FASB ASC 740, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. It is the Company s policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other expense and interest expense, respectively, as necessary. The Company s historical tax years will remain open for examination by the local authorities until the statute of limitations has passed. Value-Added Tax Enterprises or individuals, who sell commodities, engage in repair and maintenance or import or export goods in the PRC are subject to a value added tax in accordance with PRC Laws. The VAT standard rate had been 17% of the gross sale price until April 30, 2018, after which date the rate was reduced to 16%. VAT rate was further reduced to 13% starting from April 1, 2019. A credit is available whereby VAT paid on the purchases of semi-finished products or raw materials used in the production of the Company s finished products can be used to offset the VAT due on the sales of the finished products.

Accumulated comprehensive income consists of foreign currency translation. The Company presents comprehensive income (loss) in accordance with ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income . Earnings per share The Company calculates earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential ordinary shares equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. On October 24, 2019, the Company completed a reverse merger with Greenland Acquisition Corporation whereby the Company received 7,500,000 shares in exchange for all the share capital, which is reflected retroactively to December 31, 2017 and will be utilized for calculating earnings per share in all prior periods. The per share amounts have been updated to show the effect of the exchange on earnings per share as if the exchange occurred at the beginning of both years for the annual financial statements of the Company. The impact of the stock exchange is also shown on the Company s Statements of Shareholders Equity. Pursuant to the Service Agreement entered into and by the Company and Chineseinvestors.com, Inc., an Indiana corporation ( CIIX ) on August 21, 2019 (the Service Agreement ), CIIX were to provide certain investor relations services to the Company for a period of three months beginning on August 21, 2019.

The Company records accruals for such contingencies based upon the assessment of the probability of occurrence and, where determinable, an estimate of the liability. Management may consider many factors in making these assessments including past history, scientific evidence and the specifics of each matter. The Company s management has evaluated all such proceedings and claims that existed as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Normal course of businesses that relate to a wide range of matters, including among others, contracts breach liability. The Company records accruals for such contingencies based upon the assessment of the probability of occurrence and, where determinable, an estimate of the liability. Management may consider many factors in making these assessments including past history, scientific evidence and the specifics of each matter. The Company s management has evaluated all such proceedings and claims that existed as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Related Party In general, related parties exist when there is a relationship that offers the potential for transactions at less than arm s-length, favorable treatment, or the ability to influence the outcome of events different from that which might result in the absence of that relationship. A related party may be any of the following: a) an affiliate, which is a party that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another party b) a principle owner, owner of record or known beneficial owner of more than 10% of the voting interest of an entity c) management, which are persons having responsibility for achieving objectives of the entity and requisite authority to make decision d) immediate family of management or principal owners e) a parent Company and its subsidiaries and f) other parties that have ability to significant influence the management or operating policies of the entity. The Company discloses all significant related party transactions. Economic and Political Risks The Company s operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC economy. The Company s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts receivable. All of the Company s cash is maintained with state-owned banks within the PRC, and none of these deposits are covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts. A portion of the Company s sales are credit sales which are primarily to customers whose abilities to pay are dependent upon the industry economics prevailing in these areas however, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is limited due to generally short payment terms. The Company also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to help further reduce credit risk. Exchange Risk The Company cannot guarantee that the current exchange rate will remain steady. Therefore, there is a possibility that the Company could post the same amount of profit for two comparable periods and yet, because of a fluctuating exchange rates, record higher or lower profit depending on exchange rate of PRC Renminbi (RMB) converted to U.S. dollars on the relevant dates. The exchange rate could fluctuate depending on changes in the political and economic environment without notice.

Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments, in April 2019. To clarify that receivables arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting standards. In October 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) and Leases (Topic 842), which defers the effective date for public filers that are considered small reporting companies as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Since the Company is a smaller reporting company, implementation is not needed until January 1, 2023. Adoption of the standard requires using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align existing credit loss methodology with the new standard. The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on its consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems, and expects the standard will have a minor impact on its consolidated financial statements. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04 (Topic 350) Intangibles Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under the amended guidance, a goodwill impairment charge will now be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As amended by ASU 2019- 10, this ASU will be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact of the application of this standard and does not expect that the adoption of the ASU 2017-04 will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13 Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which eliminates, adds, and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements under ASC 820. This ASU is to be applied on a prospective basis for certain modified or new disclosure requirements, and all other amendments in the standard are to be applied on a retrospective basis. The new standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted Topic 820 on January 1, 2020. The adoption of the ASU 2018-13 did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes ( ASU 2019-12 ). ASU 2019-12 will simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company does not expect that the requirements of ASU 2019-12 will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

It was a year that affected us all due to the global  COVID-19 pandemic. The impact has been widely felt  across societies and families, as well as in the ASML  community. But it was also a year that brought new  learnings. For me personally, for instance, if you'd asked  me 12 months ago if I could lead a company of over  28,000 people of which over 80% were at home, I would  have said: “Are you out of your mind? Of course that won't  work!" But this is what happened in 2020 – and it has  worked. We even managed to close the acquisition of  Berliner Glas Group, and welcomed around 1,600 new  colleagues into ASML. While recognizing fully the severity of the pandemic, I also  see 2020 as a year that underlined the importance of our  work at ASML. Around the world people were abruptly  confined to their homes and forced to work from their  study, kitchen or bedroom. What was remarkable is that  despite this widespread working from home, few  companies experienced productivity loss. And let's not forget the many colleagues in our factories,  and those who went to customers' factories and worked  under very difficult conditions. Those who had to take long- distance trips to serve our customers were quarantined for  weeks and forced to stay in their hotel rooms. Their  dedication is nothing short of amazing and reflects the true  ASML spirit. For those who had to work from home, the  trust we put in their hands was returned with incredible  flexibility and commitment. We even had to urge our  colleagues to take breaks to stay physically and mentally  fit. All of this was possible because the digital tools that the  high-tech industry has developed over the past two  decades proved sufficiently mature to support individuals  and, even more importantly, collaboration in virtual teams.  ASML systems have contributed significantly to advance  and make affordable the necessary electronic building  blocks for this digital transformation. During 2020, we collaborated closely with our partners in  the supply chain to ensure we could continue to  manufacture and ship systems to our customers. The  situation was very dynamic and I am impressed with the  way that we managed to deal with the many challenges.  This is how, collectively, we limited the impact of COVID-19  on our company. We kept up our strong financial  performance and we were able to continue to return capital  through dividends and share buybacks. What were the main factors behind ASML’s strong  performance in such a challenging year?   The global economic consequences of COVID-19 had a  limited impact on ASML' results. Declining consumer  spending on smartphones and automotive was offset by  increasing investments in 'working-from-home' electronics,  datacenters and the communications network  infrastructure needed to support an economy where data is  an important driver of economic value and productivity. ASML does not produce these electronic devices or the  software and digital services that run over them, but our  systems are essential to manufacture the semiconductors  that power this ecosystem. ASML and other  semiconductor equipment peers are an integral part of this  global electronic ecosystem of many dozens of companies  that generates $400 billion worth of annual taxable profit. It  is the strong performance of our entire ecosystem that  powered the demand for our products and services this  year, and enabled us to deliver record results. What were your customers' priorities in 2020?  We divide our customers into two main market segments.  First, the customers who produce Logic chips, who kept  their steady pace of increasing investments in new  production nodes. This explains the increasing demand for  our most-advanced EUV systems, which customers need  for the ramp of 5 nm chip production and the preparation  for 3 nm chips. These advanced chips, the size of a  thumbnail, contain up to a dozen billion transistors, which  will power the latest and greatest smartphones, computers  and other data-processing devices. Second, the market segment of customers who produce  Memory chips, who started the year in a 'wait and see'  mode, but showed signs of recovery throughout the year.  The Memory segment routinely experiences supply and  demand swings, which you need to visualize as a  continuously upward swinging trend. The underlying growth in Memory 'bit' demand is the result  of continuously rising data traffic that needs to be stored  on servers and consumer devices. Our customers can  meet this increase largely by shrinking the size of the  memory transistors on their chips. They do this by adding  more advanced ASML systems to make the smallest  features on the chip even smaller. If the global economy is  strong or when new data-hungry applications are  introduced, the demand for Memory rises even faster. this case, the Memory makers need to add new production  lines or even entirely new fabs. To support the projected bit  growth, we expect that customers will need to add more  capacity, as observed in our Q4 results. What do you expect for 2021? The digital transformation and wider technology trends  significantly shape our roadmap and are driving our  industry forward. Our Logic customers are very clear that  they will continue their investments in ramping new, more  advanced nodes. The pace will depend on the health of the  global economy, and even more so on the value provided  by the electronics and semiconductor industries, which are  enabling the world's digital transformation. For the Memory  segment, demand did not outpace supply in 2020, due to  COVID-19 uncertainty. Based on our customers’  comments at the end of 2020, and improving market  conditions, we expect to see stronger lithography demand  from Memory customers in 2021 versus 2020. Another significant revenue stream comes from service  and upgrades of ASML systems installed at our customers’  fabs. We expect our service revenue to grow with a  growing installed base, whereas our upgrade business is  more dependent on the release of new upgrades and the  interest and capability of our customers. In summary, although we are currently going through a  period of near-term uncertainty, the outlook for 2021 is  positive, and the long-term demand drivers have only  increased confidence in our future sustainable growth  outlook towards 2025. Does anything stand in the way of that optimistic view? When I am asked what the future holds, my first response  is that of course there are many uncertainties in today's  world. We don't know what the effects of the COVID-19  crisis will be. In addition, geopolitical tensions and export  control issues could have a significant impact on our  industry. Looking specifically at our company, short-term  business cycles and fluctuations in the global economy  may have an impact on our business performance, even  when the long-term megatrends provide us with a solid  foundation. Most important is that we continue to put the  customer at the heart of our business. Listening to the  customer may sound obvious, but having direct interaction  and communication with our customers is no longer  possible for all ASML employees. We are making an extra  effort to bring the voice of our customers to all ASML  employees, through the online and off-line channels at our  disposal. Everyone at ASML is constantly reminded of the reality that  ASML systems are at the heart of our customers’ fabs, and  in many cases our systems are even at the heart of our  customers’ business strategies. This is a tremendous  responsibility that should weigh heavily on all our  shoulders. This feeling of responsibility and humility starts  with the people who design and develop new systems and  solutions. It continues with the folks who assemble the  systems in our factories and our service engineers in the  field. It is carried all the way to our office staff who provide  support to their colleagues around the world. As long as  we cherish this 'customer-centricity', we will continue to  deserve the trust that our customers have put in us. “Although we are currently  going through a period of   near-term uncertainty, the  outlook for 2021 is positive.” How would you describe ASML’s footprint in the  broader society?  It's clear there is increasing interest in companies’  ecological and social footprints. We continue to apply  corporate responsibility standards in the pursuit of our  business ambitions. Our innovation ecosystem, energy- efficient products, circular use of materials and a  responsible supply chain are our key sustainability  priorities. These are vital for the long-term success of our  business and long-term value we create for all our  stakeholders. We continue to accelerate talent development and we  promote a diverse and inclusive workplace that drives  creativity and new ideas. We also drive collaborative  innovation in environmentally friendly solutions for our  customers. We are strongly committed to ethical business  behavior, and we play an active role in promoting high  standards of business conduct across the value chain.  Outside the walls of our organization, we are committed to  supporting schools with science, technology, engineering  and math (STEM) subjects, particularly among female  students, to support children and young adults to unlock  their potential. Do ASML’s customers demand different things now  than they did in the past? Our customers run very tight operations in gigantic fabs  worth tens of billions of euros. A small disruption in the  production process can disrupt their supply of chips for  weeks. This means that the quality and availability of ASML  systems are more important than ever before. In addition,  as our industry grows, the impact that we and our  customers have on our societies and communities also  grows. All our customers have ambitious sustainability  targets and they expect ASML to help them achieve those  targets by, for instance, reducing energy consumption and  also by being a responsible employer and good corporate  citizen. We welcome these ambitions, because they align perfectly  with our purpose, our vision and our values.

It affected how we lived, interacted with each  other, and worked – in every country, region,  village and community. Businesses and entire  industries had to adapt to a new situation  overnight, and many struggled to stay afloat.  Countries came to a complete standstill, and  there were uncountable stories of personal  tragedy. This was a year where people had to  pull together in unprecedented ways to tackle  the pandemic. Of course, our company was impacted by the pandemic  too, and in this Annual Report, we will describe its effect on  our organization, the challenges we faced, and how we  overcame these to continue to run our business. Two priorities At ASML, as with many other companies, there was an  intense period at the start of the year when we had to  introduce, develop and communicate our crisis- management measures. In a very short time, we moved  from a policy of 'stay home if you have flu-like symptoms'  to 'stay at home, period'. Fortunately, and in accordance  with strict safety measures, our colleagues working directly  in the production of our scanners, in the clean rooms,  logistics or other supporting departments were able to  continue their work in otherwise deserted locations. We have two very clear priorities in our crisis response and  communications, then and now. Our number one priority is  to ensure the health and safety of our people and their  families. The second priority is to ensure business  continuity: manufacture our products, provide service to  our customers, and develop future products according to  our roadmap. In all our health and safety measures, we follow the  guidelines of the World Health Organization and local  health authorities. And although we developed an ASML- specific policy worldwide, we follow national government  measures in the regions where we operate. Challenge, Collaborate, Care We know that COVID-19 is not behind us, but looking back  on 2020, we can say we have delivered on our priorities. We have also learned how important ASML’s company  values are, and why we need them now more than ever.  When the future is uncertain and there are no easy  answers, these values of Challenge, Collaborate and Care  have and will provide a strong foundation for everything we  do. In 2020, we really lived our values, and they united us  in many ways. They are our DNA. For example: Prioritizing our colleagues, their families  and our business Throughout the year, our people were our top priority:  keeping them safe by creating a secure workplace,  providing mental and physical health support, and staying  in close contact even when working remotely.  Undoubtedly, this experience has made us stronger as a  global team. Then, although it was not always easy, we were able to  continue to run our business and serve our customers. Our  operational capabilities returned to normal in the second  quarter. We were able to source the modules and parts for  our products, complete installs and upgrades, and service  our customers across the globe. One of ASML’s strengths as a company has always been  that its people pull together when we need to most. The  past year certainly stands as testimony to this strength. • With every local lockdown and travel restriction that  came into effect, we challenged ourselves and others  to come up with creative ways to do our work and fulfil  our obligations. Our can-do mentality was evident in so  many ways. • Our ability to collaborate proved to be extremely  valuable in these times. We were not in the crisis  alone, and we made sure our partners, customers and  colleagues knew we supported them. • We united in our care for our colleagues, suppliers,  customers and communities. Colleagues around the  world went above and beyond to provide support at all  levels. This included voluntarily going into quarantine  far from home to support a customer, to delivering  critical medical equipment and protective clothing to  organizations in need. For all the ways we have moved forward as a society, the  world faces crucial challenges for the future. We must  change how we think and act on themes that impact  everyone, like energy use, climate change, mobility and  access to healthcare and nutrition. At ASML, we believe that the chip industry is in a unique  position to help tackle these challenges. From artificial  intelligence (AI) to a vast internet of things (IoT), microchips  are at the heart of modern technology. So whether it’s  transitioning to sustainable energy, improving global health,  increasing the safety and efficiency of transport, tackling  pollution, bridging the digital divide, or feeding eight billion  people without exhausting the earth’s resources, our vision  is that we will enable the groundbreaking technology that  will help solve some of humanity’s toughest challenges. As the innovation leader that makes vital systems for chip  manufacturing, we are proud to not only be a part of these  solutions, but also the ones who are making them possible.  We can only play this role if we continue to challenge the  status quo, tap into the collective knowledge of our global  ecosystem and create an environment where people can  contribute, learn and grow. At ASML, we believe our  purpose is to unlock the potential of people and society by  pushing technology to new limits.  The long-term growth of the semiconductor industry is  based on the principle that the energy, cost and time  required for electronic computations can be reduced by  shrinking transistors on microchips. One of the main  drivers of shrink is the resolution that systems can achieve,  which is mainly determined by the wavelength of the light  used and the numerical aperture of the optics. A shorter  wavelength – like a finer brush used for painting – can print  smaller features. A larger numerical aperture can focus the Our purpose  light more tightly, which also leads to better resolution. To  enable shrink, what we do – lithography –  is key. We are a global innovation leader in the chip industry. We provide chipmakers with hardware,  software and services to mass produce patterns on silicon through lithography.  What we do  increases the value and lowers the cost of a chip, which advances us all towards a smarter,  more connected world. 1 Berliner Glas Group has been refected throughout this report, with the exception of our non-fnancial reporting. As such, we are a focused supplier of holistic lithography  solutions to all of the world’s major chipmakers. Our  mission, together with our partners, is to provide leading  patterning solutions that drive the advancement of  microchips. Through our sustained investment in, and  dedication to, research and development, we innovate at  least at the same pace as our customers. We put our  innovations in the hands of chipmakers as quickly as  possible by engineering in parallel, not sequentially, while  ensuring their quality, reliability, manufacturability, and  serviceability. Our core values  To help solve humanity’s toughest challenges while at the  same time addressing our own, we must continue to  amplify ASML's core values that created our success –  Challenge, Collaborate, Care. We challenge  We challenge boundaries, question the status quo and  stand up for the ideas we believe in. We’re comfortable with  discussion and debate, because it is often inherent to  stress-testing and championing an idea. This is what  enables us to push technology forward, keep things simple  and do things with care and attention. We always challenge  ourselves to add value for our customer, ensuring  we  continually improve across key aspects, like safety, quality,  efficiency and cost. We collaborate  As a system architect and system integrator, we collaborate  to tap into our collective potential. Together with our  partners in our ecosystem, we expand our knowledge and €14.0bn Net sales €11.8bn Asia   €1.7bn US   €0.5bn EMEA skills, learn from each other, and share approaches to  deliver the best results. What we do is unique, and we  need each other to make it possible. As we continue to  grow and our ecosystem of partners expands, this  collaborative mindset becomes even more essential to  success. We care  As we push technology further together, we have to do so  with care. As an industry leader, we realize our impact  extends from people, to society, to the planet. We care not  only for those we work with, but for our customers,  suppliers, the world we live in, and the communities where  we do business. We believe in integrity and respect for  people and their human rights. We take personal  responsibility to create a safe, inclusive and trusting  environment where people from all backgrounds are  encouraged and enabled to speak up, contribute, learn,  make mistakes, and grow. We also take care to create  clarity in how we organize ourselves to achieve our goals,  making sure we have a clear framework for what we do  and how we do it. These values will help our company and our employees to  make smart decisions that will benefit all stakeholders. Our  values and purpose, together with the great responsibility  we have as an industry leader, make us keenly optimistic  for the future. Where we come from  Our company was founded in 1984 in Eindhoven under the  name of ASM Lithography, a joint venture between Philips  and ASM International. As they moved into their new space  near the Philips factories at Strijp-T in Eindhoven, our first  employees could never have imagined that in just three  decades, ASML would be a global innovation leader. We’ve grown from our humble beginnings to a global force  through relentless focus on innovation, sheer customer  focus through tough times, and a willingness to rely on  others to come to a better result. We are geared towards providing long-term value to our  customers and other stakeholders. Our direct value chain  consists of our R&D partners, supply chain and customers,  as well as our own manufacturing and service activities.  Together we enable product and service manufactures, so- called Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), and  Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs), to create end-use  devices and services for the consumer market. We also learned to rely on others to come to a better result  – without losing focus. That meant expanding our own  knowledge and skills by building an ecosystem of expert  suppliers, strategic partners, academia and service  providers. We also acquired leading companies with  unique technologies that strengthened our ability to deliver  better solutions to our customers. We started to see  ourselves as architects and integrators, inspiring our  partners to innovate on the cutting edge of engineering  while sharing risk and reward. And like us, some of our  earliest customers are now leaders in the chip industry. Although we’re constantly looking to the future, where we  have come from is just as important to us as we evolve.  These pioneering behaviors have been key to our success  over the past 36 years, and they’ve become even more  important to us as we continue to define our purpose and  articulate the values that underpin everything we do.  Understanding what made us successful in the past will  help us maintain our success in the future. What guides us  Innovation is rarely a straight line. We've always known that  it takes laser focus, multidisciplinary teamwork and a keen  eye for how we can best help our customers. And even  then, we've had to show grit. It took a decade of tenacity  to get our technology off the ground. We've cared for this  company like it was our own, and are proudly committed  to its success. We believed then as we do now that even  the biggest challenge can be overcome by chipping away,  if necessary with hundreds of people over many years. The role of lithography  Lithography is a driving force in the creation of more powerful, faster and cheaper chips. Today’s most advanced  processors, based on the Logic N5 node, contain billions of transistors. But shrinking transistors further is becoming  increasingly difficult. We aren’t as close to the fundamental limits of physics as some would think. Next-generation chip  designs will include more advanced materials, new packaging technologies, and more complex 3D designs, which will  create the electronics of the future.     The manufacturing of chips becomes increasingly complex as semiconductor feature sizes shrink, while the imperative to  mass produce at the right cost remains. Our holistic lithography product portfolio helps to optimize production and enable  affordable shrink by integrating lithography systems with computational modeling, as well as metrology and inspection  solutions. Our computational models enable our customers to optimize their mask design and tape-out time. This works  through mask-correction software to prepare and modify the design for optimized exposures, while the inspection  solutions help in analyzing and controlling the manufacturing process in real time. A lithography system is essentially a projection system. Light is projected through a blueprint of the pattern that will be  printed (known as a ‘mask’ or ‘reticle’). With the pattern encoded in the light, the system’s optics shrink and focus the  pattern onto a photosensitive silicon wafer. After the pattern is printed, the system moves the wafer slightly and makes  another copy on the wafer. This process is repeated until the wafer is covered in patterns, completing one layer of the wafer’s chips. To make an entire  microchip, this process is repeated layer after layer, stacking the patterns to create an integrated circuit (IC). The simplest  chips have around 10 layers, while the most complex can have over 150 layers. The size of the features to be printed  varies depending on the layer, which means that different types of lithography systems are used for different layers – our  latest-generation EUV systems for the most critical layers with the smallest features to ArF, KrF, and i-line DUV systems for  less critical layers with larger features. • CD is the critical dimension, a measure of how small the  smallest structures are that the lithography system can  print.  • λ (lambda) is the wavelength of the light source  used and the smaller the wavelength the smaller the  structures that can be printed. Our deep ultraviolet  (DUV) lithography systems, known as the industry  workhorse, dive deep into the UV light spectrum to print  the tiny features that form the basis of the microchip.  Over the years ASML made several wavelength steps  and our DUV lithography systems range from 365 nm  (i-line), 248 nm (KrF) to 193 nm (ArF). With the extreme  ultraviolet (EUV) systems, we provide highest-resolution  lithography in high-volume manufacturing, as these  systems make a major step in wavelength as with  EUV tin plasma we generate EUV light which has a  wavelength of just 13.5 nm. Rayleigh's equation that drives Moore’s  Law Moore’s Law, a prediction made over half a century ago,  set the pace for our industry. Gordon Moore predicted that  computing would dramatically increase in power, and  decrease in relative cost, at an exponential pace. In other  words, the number of transistors (tiny electrical switches)  on an integrated circuit will double every two to three years  at the same cost. This opens up two options to make  microchips faster and more powerful: by using the same  number of transistors on a chip at half the cost, or by  doubling the number of transistors at the same cost. Even  today the power of this prediction is the fundamental  principle of the semiconductor industry and the driving  force for innovations that benefit our daily lives. At ASML, our job is to help the industry continue Moore’s  Law. Our goal has always been to reduce the critical  dimension (CD) – the smallest structure that a lithography  system can print. This is defined by Rayleigh’s criterion, the  equation on which all our innovation is based: ASML's goal has always been to reduce the critical  dimension. By reducing the wavelength and increasing the  numerical aperture, our systems can print IC structures in  increasingly smaller feature sizes. If our customers can  print smaller structures, the chips can be smaller and the  cost per transistor become cheaper, which in turn makes it  more profitable for our customers. Extending Moore’s Law is becoming increasingly complex  and costly. What will always be needed is a way to mass  produce IC designs at the right cost. That’s where the full  scope of ASML’s product portfolio will continue to play a  big role to ensure affordable transistor shrink. We continue  to push our entire system portfolio to new productivity  levels and imaging performance. Our EUV and High-NA  lithography will enable tomorrow’s most advanced chips. In  our computational lithography solutions, we’re bringing  machine learning and big data to the forefront in predicting  both lithography and metrology processes with 100%  accuracy. Finally, we have developed an entirely new class  of e-beam inspection systems to help our customers  control defectivity in manufacturing in next-generation chip  nodes, as those smaller structures can hardly be detected  with optical inspection. • NA is the numerical aperture, indicating the entrance  angle of the light and with larger NA lenses/ mirrors  smaller structures can be printed. Besides larger  lenses ASML increased the NA of our ArF systems by  maintaining a thin film of water between the last lens  element and the wafer, using the breaking index of the  water to increase the NA (so called immersion systems).  After the wavelength step to EUV, ASML is developing  the next generation EUV systems, called high-NA where  we push the NA from 0.33 to 0.55. • k1 is a factor relating to optical and process  optimizations. Together with our computational  lithography and patterning control software solutions we  provide the control loops for our customers to optimize  their mask designs and illumination conditions. The semiconductor industry is driven by  affordable scaling (the ability to make smaller  transistors at the right price). This in turn is  powered by ASML’s holistic lithography product  portfolio. We provide our customers with a suite  of patterning solutions to mass produce  patterns on silicon, allowing them to increase  the value and lower the cost of a chip. Our  portfolio is aligned with industry trends and our  customers’ product roadmaps, which require  lithography-enabled shrink beyond the current  decade. We continue to push our lithography systems to new levels  of productivity and imaging performance so that  chipmakers can continue to shrink nodes. However, as  shrink continues, our customers face unprecedented  engineering, material, structural and manufacturing  difficulties. Our holistic lithography solutions integrate  products from across our portfolio to help address these  challenges. We help customers achieve their pattern fidelity  requirements through increased control over the quality  and consistency of the patterns being printed on the chip  with our metrology and inspection systems and  computational lithography solutions. In addition, we  support our growing installed base with best-in-class  customer support. Our highly differentiated solutions  provide unique value drivers for our customers and ASML,  working together to ensure affordable shrink. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography  systems More than two decades ago we started with the  development of EUV technology. For sure it was "no walk  in the park" and since the start we invested more than €6  billion in R&D, as well as acquired Cymer to accelerate  EUV source technology, and helped to solve several  technical challenges to enable the EUV infrastructure to  meet our customers high-volume manufacturing  requirements. This partially explains why ASML is the  world’s only manufacturer of EUV lithography systems. Our EUV platform extends our customers’ Logic and  Memory roadmaps by delivering resolution improvements,  state-of-the-art overlay performance and year-on-year cost  reductions. EUV lithography uses light with a wavelength of  just 13.5 nm. This is a reduction of almost 15 times  compared to the other lithography solution in advanced  chipmaking, deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography, which uses  193 nm light. This allows our customers to use EUV single  exposure instead of very complex multiple-patterning ArF  immersion exposures, and allows them to further shrink the  structures. Our EUV product roadmap is intended to drive  affordable scaling to 2030 and beyond. TWINSCAN NXE:3400C is our latest-generation EUV  lithography system. It combines productivity, highest  resolution, state-of-the-art overlay and focus performance,  while also improving availability. Our next EUV model on  this platform, the NXE:3600D, is planned for delivery in High-NA We are also developing the next generation of EUV  lithography systems with a higher numerical aperture (NA),  known as High-NA technology. Our customers have  ordered R&D system to evaluate the high-volume  production opportunities in the 2025 time frame. This  technology will enable geometric chip scaling beyond the  current decade, offering resolution and overlay capability  that is 70% better than our current EUV platform. Deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography  systems  Although EUV is entering the high-volume manufacturing  era, DUV lithography still produces the majority of layers in  a customer device today and will remain important for  future devices. Therefore, ASML continues to develop DUV  systems to improve value for our customers. We offer  immersion and dry lithography solutions that help  manufacture a broad range of semiconductor nodes and  technologies. Our DUV immersion and dry systems lead  the industry in productivity, imaging and overlay  performance for high-volume manufacturing of the most  advanced Logic and Memory chips, while continuing to  deliver value for the matured nodes. Immersion systems An enhancement to ArF lithography, immersion lithography  maintains a thin film of water between the last lens element  and the wafer, increasing NA and improving resolution to  support further shrink. Our immersion systems are suitable  for both single exposure and multiple-patterning  lithography, and can be used in seamless combination with  EUV systems to print different layers of the same chip. TWINSCAN NXT:2050i is our current state-of-the-art  immersion system and is being ramped up in high-volume  manufacturing of the 5 nm Logic and third generation of 10  nm DRAM nodes. The NXT:2050i is based on a new  version of the NXT platform, which includes new  developments in the reticle stage, wafer stage, projection  lens, and exposure laser. Thanks to these innovations, the  system delivers better overlay control at higher productivity  than its predecessor. mid-2021 and will provide further productivity gains plus a  significant improvement in overlay. Dry systems Our portfolio of dry systems offers tool types for all  wavelengths currently used in the semiconductor industry,  from i-line using 365 nm wavelength, KrF using 248 nm  and ArF using light of 193 nm supporting the continued  progress to enable shrink. TWINSCAN NXT:1470 is our latest dry ArF lithography  system. It is also the first dry NXT system, building on our  successful immersion platform, and delivers improvements  in matched machine overlay, productivity and its footprint  in the fab. TWINSCAN XT:860M is our most popular KrF system,  supporting high-volume 200 mm and 300 mm wafer  production at and below 110 nm resolution. For more  critical KrF layers, the higher-NA TWINSCAN XT:1060K is  our most advanced KrF lithography system, and offers  best-in-class resolution and overlay. TWINSCAN XT:400L is our latest i-line lithography system,  printing features down to a resolution of 220 nm for 200  mm and 300 mm wafer production. Metrology and inspection systems  Delivering speed and accuracy, our metrology and  inspection portfolio covers every step of the manufacturing  process, from R&D to mass production. The information  captured through our metrology and inspections systems  helps us to control the thousands of knobs in the scanner  to enlarge the process window and improve yield for our  customers. Together with our computational lithography  and patterning-control software solutions, these systems  help chipmakers achieve the highest yield and best  performance in mass production. Optical metrology and inspection Our YieldStar optical metrology solutions can quickly and  accurately measure the quality of patterns on the wafer. YieldStar 385H offers the latest in-resist post lithography  overlay and focus metrology, with enhanced throughput  and accuracy. Overlay, how well one layer is aligned to its  previous layer, is becoming more important as structures  get smaller and error tolerance reduces. Compared to  previous systems, key enhancements include a faster  stage and faster wavelength changing. This enables highly  accurate overlay measurements and tool matching using  multiple wavelengths without impacting throughput. YieldStar 1375F is the only optical tool on the market for  fast, accurate in-device overlay and metrology. Capable of  measuring multiple layers at once, it helps customers  improve yield through post-etch process control. E-beam metrology and inspection  Our HMI e-beam solutions allow customers to locate and  analyze individual chip defects amid billions of printed  features, extending the possibilities for process control.  Historically, e-beam solutions were too slow to monitor  volume production processes. However, ASML has made  progress in various methods for increasing the throughput  of e-beam systems. probable or most critical. This insight is used to guide the  e-beam inspection system and optimize scan strategies,  increasing the effective productivity. In addition, in 2020 we shipped the first multiple e-beam  (multibeam) inspection system. The HMI eScan 1000  demonstrated successful multibeam operation,  simultaneously scanning with nine beams. It increases  throughput by up to 600% compared to single e-beam  systems, thus reducing the cost of inspection. Computational lithography  Our computational lithography and software solutions  revolve around creating applications that enhance the  setup of the lithography system so chipmakers can print  exactly what they want to print. Accurate simulation  models of the lithography process are a foundational  element for all these applications. These models  represent a wide variety of physical and chemical Managing our installed base systems  The installed base of ASML systems continues to grow,  with many systems finding second or even third lives at  new owners in new markets and applications. To provide  all our customers with the best possible value proposition,  we offer an extensive Installed Base Management portfolio,  including a wide range of service and upgrade options. We develop and sell product options and enhancements  designed to improve throughput, patterning performance  and overlay. Through field-upgrade packages, it is possible  to upgrade older systems to newer models in the field. This  enables customers to optimize their cost of ownership over  the system’s lifetime. Meanwhile, our Mature Products and Services (MPS)  business refurbishes used lithography equipment and  offers associated services. We focus on the refurbishment  of three product families: the ‘classic’ PAS 5500, the first  generation AT systems, and the early generation NXT and  XT systems. We are investing to be able to extend the  lifetime of the PAS platform until at least 2030. Customer support  We support our customers with a broad range of  applications, services, and technical support products to  maintain and enhance our systems' performance. We have  more than 6,200 customer support employees, including  service engineers and applications specialists, who work to  ensure the systems in our customers’ fabs run at the  highest levels of predictability and availability. We offer 24/7  support, next-day parts delivery, an easy, centralized  customer portal, and training for customer engineers. Visit www.asml.com for more product details and  specifications. effects. Machine learning solutions are now broadly used in  the simulation models as well as in the applications. With NAND chips, data can be stored even when a device  is powered off. DRAM memory is used to efficiently provide  data to the processor. These DRAM and NAND chips are  typically made in dedicated Memory-chip factories. Logic chips, which process information in electronic  devices, are produced by two groups of manufacturers.  The first group, known as integrated device manufacturers Our customers are the world’s leading microchip  manufacturers, and our success is inextricably linked  with theirs. We design our machines based on their  input, engage in helping them achieve their technology  and cost roadmaps, and work together to make sure  our machines are running smoothly in their fabs. Our customers can be grouped into Memory and Logic  chipmakers. Memory chips can store a large amount of data in a very  small area. They are used in an increasing variety of  electronic products like servers, data centers,  smartphones, high-performance computing, automotive or  personal computers, and other communication devices.  There are two main classes of Memory: NAND and DRAM. (IDM), designs and manufactures Logic chips. The second  group comprises contract manufacturers known as  foundries. Foundry manufacturers produce chips for  ‘fabless’ companies, which focus only on chip design and  distribution, but do not manufacture themselves. Both Logic and Memory chips can vary greatly in  complexity and capability. For example, the most  advanced chips are powering leading-edge technology in  artificial intelligence (AI), big data and automotive  technology, while the simpler, low-cost chips are  integrating sensing capabilities in everyday technology to  create a vast IoT. The chip market has grown by 5% per year on average  over the past 20 years, but the factors driving this growth  have radically changed. In the 1990s, personal computers  (PCs), both desktops and later laptops, drove chip  demand. In the first decade of this century, the market  driver evolved from PCs to smartphones. These in turn  produced new market drivers, data centers and cloud  solutions, where data from PCs and smartphones is  routed, processed and stored with the extensive use of  specialized Logic chips, in combination with DRAM, NAND  and HDD storage. There are around 40 billion connected devices currently in use, with more being added every second. This number is  expected to increase to 350 billion devices by 2030. Connected IoT devices are expected to create up to 175 ZB  (zettabyte) of data per year by 2025. In other words, one zettabyte (1021 byte) equals a trillion gigabytes, and to download  175 ZB data with average current internet connection speed would take one person 1.8 billion years. This big data will  need to become fast data to allow for ubiquitous computing as we move towards ‘edge’ computing, where processing is  brought as close to the source of data as possible, rather than in the cloud. Technology is evolving fast, and the next level of computing is dawning. The era of mobile  computing – where you bring the computer with you – is evolving towards immersive ‘ubiquitous  computing’, with computing power available wherever you go. The transition to ubiquitous computing is enabled by what has been termed the ‘artificial intelligence of things’ (AIoT). AIoT  is a smart and connected network of devices that seamlessly communicate over powerful 5G networks, allowing us to  unleash the power of data better and faster than ever. This combination of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the  internet of things (IoT) infrastructure will achieve more efficient IoT operations, improve human-to-machine interactions,  and enhance data management and analytics. The potential of AIoT will gradually open up as IoT and AI increasingly  intertwine, facilitated by 5G. The vast amount of data that people can access, and the insights this provides, will fuel  semiconductor business growth and transformation. Semiconductor-enabled computing trends Moore's Law is the guiding principle for the semiconductor industry, the motor driving the industry to transit from mobile  computing to ubiquitous computing. This amplification continues to expand, facilitating three major trends in computing:  applications, data and algorithms. Smart home Smart home devices such as thermostats, lights and smart  TVs learn a user’s habits to provide automated home  support for everyday tasks. Applications: energy efficiency,  safety, entertainment, access control and personal comfort. Smart industry  Smart industry devices use real-time data analytics and  machine-to-machine sensors to optimize processes. Data  generated from these devices helps foresee bottlenecks,  preventing errors and injuries. Applications: autonomous  manufacturing robots, automated supply chain  management and predictive sensors. Smart city Smart cities that integrated all levels of municipal services.  Applications: open data for better urban planning,  optimized energy consumption and increased public safety  through smart traffic surveillance. 5G connectivity 5G enables a new kind of network that is designed to  connect virtually everyone and everything together  including machines, objects, and devices. It empowers  new user experiences and connects new industries. Wearables  Wearable devices continuously monitor and track user  preferences and habits. Applications include fitness and  health trackers, heart-rate monitoring and wireless  headphones. Self-driving cars These supercomputers on wheels are enabled by  electronics and semiconductors. Autonomous vehicles  offer ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) features  that reduce accidents and casualties and allow us to stay  connected continuously through infotainment systems. Autonomous robotics A new generation of lightweight robots fitted with smart  sensors enables humans and machines to collaborate  closely and safely. Smart robots that are connected to a  greater network can benefit from big data and collective  learning making it possible to reduce manufacturing costs  and improve quality of products.

Read more in: Our people Global geopolitics The current trade environment presents significant challenges for the global semiconductor industry, and trade tensions  and increased protectionism are likely to continue. US authorities took steps that further restrict US chipmakers and other  companies from doing business with China. These actions are impacting the semiconductor industry’s ability to conduct  business in the global marketplace. The industry is being forced to manage trading costs. Ultimately, this could be passed on to the end-market resulting in an  increase of prices of devices. Besides the financial implication, trade tensions and protectionism also introduce significant  complexity throughout the supply chain and its processes. This is forcing the industry to relook at its global supply  chain. Read more in: Our supply chain, How we manage risk, Risk factors Expanding R&D costs In the rapidly evolving semiconductor industry, access to the latest technologies, chip designs and manufacturing  processes is the basis for competition. R&D is an ever bigger priority and expense. Chipmakers are faced with supporting  applications and end markets that are becoming increasingly complex. Traditional semiconductor companies are  challenged to diversify their portfolio, due to the rise of tech platform companies moving to in-house chip design. In addition, the incremental costs of executing innovation are rising, requiring higher levels of R&D investments to achieve  the same goals. Getting products to the market faster is essential – or the chipmakers risk missing the boat. As a result,  there is increased pressure to get solutions to the customers early. Read more in: Technology & innovation ecosystem, Risk factors,  Financial performance Changing landscape To capitalize the convergence of mega trends such as AI, IoT, 5G and autonomous vehicles, the industry is investing  significant amounts in assets that can unlock value across the portfolio. The global semiconductor industry has shown tremendous growth in recent years and this is set to continue. It is  refocusing on increasing scale and proficiency in core competences as well as expanding into new capabilities and new  markets. Mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures are expected to be key parts of the chip-market strategy, with deals  focusing on emerging technologies. Read more in: Semiconductor industry trends and opportunities, Our supply chain and Risk factors Taking action on climate change Climate change is an urgent matter around the world. It is a global challenge that requires global responsibility to limit a  temperature rise to well below 2°C. Our industry has a role to play. The semiconductor manufacturing process consumes large volumes of energy and water resources. Driving Moore’s Law  in enabling shrink and, at the same time, improving computing power and storage capacity, fuels the demand for these  resources. New architectures and a new way of looking at the entire ecosystem will be required to enhance energy and  water-resource efficiency. To meet these challenges, the semiconductor industry has to reduce power consumption. With data centers consuming  about 10% of the world’s electric power, it touches the boundaries of scale. Taking action on climate change is a moral  imperative. Read more in: Climate and energy SWOT analysis Acting on the global trends and developments in the semiconductor industry and in society is an important factor in the  success of our business, as well as in creating value for our stakeholders.

ASML invests in a  technology-based innovation roadmap that enables the  continued shrink of microchips by enhancing resolution  with EUV and High-NA, together with the holistic  scaling of overlay and pattern fidelity control. To  achieve this we also invest in continuing innovations in  DUV, Metrology and Inspection technology, to  supplement the power of EUV-led shrink. This is how we pursue our long-term strategic vision. To enable ‘edge’ – which brings computation and data  storage closer to the location where it is needed – our  customers continue to invest in developing more advanced  semiconductor processes to create more powerful Logic  and Memory microchips. At the same time, these also  need to be more energy-efficient and cost-effective. Five pillars of our core strategy To realize our long-term strategic vision within the semiconductor industry, we continue to drive our core strategy, which  we define around five major pillars: Strengthen customer trust, holistic lithography and applications, DUV competitiveness,  EUV industrialization and High-NA. High-NA Enable next-generation geometric shrink by extending  our 0.33 NA product portfolio to enable High-NA EUV  at the 2 nm Logic node, followed by Memory nodes at  comparable density. Enhance operational excellence capabilities by focusing  on our customers’ needs to improve cost of ownership and  deliver future nodes. Deliver on our commitment to  accelerate improvements in our sustainability performance. Strengthen our leadership position in in-device metrology,  enabling high-order overlay correction. Secure a winning  position in pattern fdelity control and combine this with   superior computational lithography. Continue our innovation leadership, driving DUV  to the highest level of performance by expanding our  installed base and through continuous improvement  and operational excellence. Secure high-volume manufacturing and improve cost  effectiveness for our customers by enhancing the value  of EUV technology for future nodes down to the 2 nm  Logic node. Geometric scaling (shrink) is a key industry driver  supporting innovation and providing long-term industry  growth. Our guiding principle is continuing Moore’s Law  towards ever-smaller, cheaper, more powerful and energy- efficient semiconductors. To enable shrink, lithography is  key, as the process is used to pattern the structures on a  microchip. We innovate across our entire product portfolio at the same  pace as our customers through large and sustained  investment in research and development. To accelerate our  product development, we engineer in parallel, not  sequentially, all the while guarding the product’s quality,  reliability, manufacturability and serviceability. This enables  us to get our innovations into the hands of chipmakers  faster. We collaborate with chipmakers to understand how  our technology best fits their needs, including their  challenges and visions of the future. It is through this  collaboration and trust that we can build for today and  develop for tomorrow. Five sustainability areas  At the same time, we want to ensure a sustainable impact while providing the best value for our stakeholders – today and  in the future. Staying focused on what matters for our business and stakeholders is the cornerstone of our strategy.  Through a materiality assessment, we identify and assess the topics most relevant to our stakeholders and which sustain  ASML's long-term business growth. (Read more in: Materiality - assessing our impact) We are committed to sustainability. To accelerate our sustainability performance, we focus on five strategic areas of  sustainability, to create long-term value for our stakeholders, shape a sustainable future, and contribute to the United  Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Innovation  ecosystem People Empowering individuals for the collective good  to ensure our employees are proud to work for us  and engaged with our ambitions as a company. Responsible  supply chain Circular economy Climate  & energy We don't innovate in isolation to ensure the fast pace  of innovation in our value chain. We develop technology  together with the help of our partners and collaborative  knowledge network. Setting the bar higher for our world-class supplier  network to achieve the innovations we strive for,  by ensuring we conduct our business in a sustainable  and responsible manner.

While increasing  productivity of our products, we are also working towards  enhancing the energy effciency of our products. We don’t innovate in isolation to ensure the fast pace of innovation in our value chain.  We develop technology together with the help of our partners and collaborative  knowledge network. In the same way, we work closely with our suppliers,  trusting them to manufacture parts and modules for our  systems. Many of them are deeply involved in developing  new technology and achieving the innovations we seek.  With some of these so-called ‘farmout suppliers’, we work  as co-investors. For example, we’ve been in partnership with Carl Zeiss AG  for over three decades. This partnership runs according to  the principle of ‘two companies, one business’ working  together to drive operational excellence. To accelerate  innovation in High-NA technology, we hold an interest in  and support Carl Zeiss SMT in R&D and other capital  investments for the design of optical columns in our  lithography systems. We co-develop expertise within a wide network of  technology partners, such as universities and research  institutions. Some of our partners include imec in Belgium,  the technical universities in Twente, Delft and Eindhoven in  the Netherlands, and the Advanced Research Center for How we innovate  Our ability to innovate is crucial to our business success.  Through our innovations, we help our customers achieve  their goals and realize new technology and applications.  We have a solid system in place to manage and enhance  innovation, achieving significant breakthroughs in recent  years. Innovation through collaboration   We innovate through partnerships. Our innovation  philosophy is one where we see ourselves as architects  and integrators, working with partners in an innovation  ecosystem. We develop our technology in close  collaboration with our customers to ensure we build today  what they need tomorrow. Our machines are developed  based on their input, and we engage closely with them to  help achieve technology and cost roadmaps. Wafers produced by  EUV installed base  €2.2bn Since its start in 2014, ARCNL developed towards a  mature research institute. With funding from UVA, VU,  NWO and ASML this institute conducts fundamental  research, focusing on the physics and chemistry that are  important in current and future key technologies within  nanolithography and its application within the  semiconductor industry. In 2020, we enhanced our  collaboration with ARCNL and a close interaction is now  established on all topics ARCNL is working on. Nanolithography (ARCNL), also in the Netherlands. In 2020,  as in previous years, these partnerships delivered good  results. Research by R&D partners we collaborate with has  delivered numerous breakthroughs that have helped  us innovate. Some of these findings surprise even the  greatest experts. This was the case when Oscar Versolato,  group leader and head of department at the Advanced  Research Center for Nanolithography (ARCNL), and his  team took a closer look at the EUV light that plays a key  role in our EUV systems. EUV light is generated when a minuscule drop of tin is  heated to a temperature of up to 400,000° Celsius. As  the tin is heated, the electrons circle in a larger orbit than  under normal circumstances. When these electrons return  from their so-called ‘excited state’ to an orbit closer to  the atom’s nucleus, energy is released in the form of light  of several wavelengths, one of which is EUV radiation.  Fundamental research by ARCNL found that many more  electrons than thought, including those in even wider  orbits, can contribute to EUV light. With this better  understanding of how the process works, we might be  able to further optimize EUV sources in the future. €28.5m Contribution to four  EU research projects We collaborate with, among others, a colleague  semiconductor equipment company Lam Research (US) to  further improve our EUV technology. In 2020, Lam  introduced a new dry photoresist technology for EUV  patterning that offers significant improvement in EUV  lithography resolution, productivity and yield. This new  technology will enable lower dose and increased  resolution. By using five to 10 times less raw materials,  Lam’s dry resist approach generates significant savings for  customers on running costs, while delivering a more  sustainable use of our EUV technology. In our innovation ecosystem, long-term collaboration is  based on trust. We share both risk and reward and work  hard at developing long-term relationships with our  partners, listening to each other and pushing each other to  continuously innovate. This collaborative approach allows  us to accelerate innovation. It also provides us with access  to a large leading-edge knowledge base across a wide  range of technologies. One of the innovation highlights from our partners in 2020  was the breakthrough imec achieved in printing narrow  pitch lines. Using ASML’s NXE:3400B system and  combining advanced imaging schemes, innovative resist  and optimized settings in its cleanroom, imec  demonstrated how our system is capable of printing lines  at 24 nm pitch in a single exposure step. This innovation  will enable imec and its partners that specialize in resist  and patterning to help develop and test resist materials  that will support the introduction of ASML’s next-generation  EUV chip-manufacturing systems, our High-NA platform. Managing innovation  Every day, more than 10,000 of the brightest minds in R&D  take on the exciting challenge to innovate the most  advanced lithography systems in the world. We manage  this process by balancing our customers’ needs, product  capabilities and technology solutions. To stay ahead, we  invest heavily in R&D. In 2020, we spent €2.2 billion on  R&D, compared to €2.0 billion in 2019. As lithography systems continue to push the edge of  chip-manufacturing technology, YieldStar’s metrology  performance must keep up – and one way to do  that, ASML Fellow Arie den Boef believes, is moving  metrology’s imaging from advanced optics to smart  algorithms.  Arie, who first led the development of YieldStar, heads  a small group from the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam  and ARCNL that conducts fundamental research in  computational imaging. The team seeks to create a  metrology system that tackles these challenges cost- effectively, with higher productivity and accuracy. Computational imaging may help achieve the quality of  optical imaging that metrology will soon need, the team  believes. But instead of using an advanced and costly  optical design, this technology would use only simple  optical elements such as a compact sensor and single  lens. The result: performance that would be impossible  with classical optical design methods. Our Research department’s focus is to generate and  explore ideas and demonstrate their feasibility in the long  term. The department also helps to find technological  solutions to challenges in our products and applications  that have moved into development. Our researchers continuously scout for technological  innovations and solutions – within the semiconductor  industry and beyond – to assess if they can be applied in  ASML’s technology roadmap to support our customers to  drive the semiconductor device roadmap. We encourage  our experts to build a wide network in the broader  technology space. The constant stream of new ideas is crucial to fill our  technology pipeline that flows through the so-called  ‘innovation funnel’. Here we select new ideas that have the  potential to advance our products and customer  application. Ideas that successfully pass the ‘proof of  concept’ stage in our Research department are transferred  to the Development & Engineering (D&E) department. D&E  takes them on into our Product Generation Process (PGP)  for product development. We then build and test system  prototypes in the necessary environments. Prototypes that  pass these tests may eventually lead to new product  releases. In 2020, the ASML Technology Conference went  virtual for the first time in its history and attracted a  record number of attendants. This unique 21st edition  allowed employees across the globe to listen to keynote  speeches and gain insights about key technical projects  across all R&D competencies Our Poster Award ceremony, which honors employees  with the most imaginative presentation demonstrating  their contribution to technological advancements,  continued this year. More than 300 teams submitted  posters. The results were as follows: Best Innovation: ‘Frequency encoding technique and its  applications’. The team developed a solution for current  inconsistencies in particle detection and sizing for DUV  and EUV systems by using a projector as an illuminator  to facilitate inspection while reducing false alarms. Best Customer Solution: ‘Integrated overlay control  solution to reduce rework by 100%’. The team designed  a solution to meet the 2.5 nm overlay in EUV machines. In D&E, we work on a multitude of advanced optical and  mechatronic modules, along with application software,  data science and operating systems. D&E innovates with a  strong focus on time-to-market, often starting new system  development before the previous generation has even  reached the customer. Teams in D&E have extensive  contact with leading research institutes, keeping up to date  with the latest developments in their respective fields. Our D&E engineers drive our machines forward by creating  new components or subsystems, integrating them into the  functional system, or developing new applications to help  move the industry forward. Innovation achievements We continue to make solid progress in EUV. For example,  in 2020 we successfully introduced a new vacuum  chamber for the EUV light production, the so-called  modular vessel. The success of this breakthrough modular  vessel project was due to close collaboration with  customers, technology partners and suppliers, and a  dedicated effort to integrate competences. This new modular vessel solves the issue of lengthy  system downtimes when parts were virtually inaccessible  leading to long down time of the EUV machine during  regular maintenance requirements. Next to the new vessel  architecture, the tin droplet generation and positioning  received a complete design overhaul to enable the supply  of tin to be refilled while the EUV source remains  operational. This eliminated the need for a costly operation  in terms of time, effort and man-hours. While systems  without inline refill like the S3-GWE vessel need to shut  down weekly for a six-hour tin refill, for systems with a  modular vessel, the inline refill is a major time-saver  improving availability and increasing value to the customer. In 2020, we shipped our first HMI eScan 1000, an  innovative inspection tool to detect defects on wafers. The  eScan 1000 is 600% faster than previous e-beam wafer Innovation pipeline To nurture innovation by our future talent pool and to fuel  the innovation pipeline we collaborate and establish  partnerships with various universities and institutes. This  collaboration allows us to accelerate innovation and gives  us access to a large pool of research scientists, high-tech  students, and academics. It also presents opportunities for  scouting new talent. In these partnerships, ASML provides  financial support and shares knowledge. In 2020, we continued our close involvement in the High  Tech Systems Center (HTSC), set up by Eindhoven  University of Technology (TU/e) to facilitate fundamental  research with a focus on understanding the needs of the  mechatronics and mechanical engineering industry. Since  its launch three and a half years ago, the HTSC has  supported the start of several new projects broadening the  scope of our cooperation with TU/e towards electrostatic inspection tools, thanks to its multibeam technology, high- speed wafer stages, and advanced computational  algorithms. The tool can scan those areas on a wafer  where critical defects are most likely. It detects electrical  and patterning defects down to 10 nm. An important achievement in our DUV technology was the  shipment of our first NXT:2050i system. The scanner is  equipped with the new XLR 960ix laser developed by  Cymer, an ASML company. This scanner is based on  improvement in so-called ‘speckle’ performance, and  moves both overlay and productivity forward significantly.  The NXT:2050i enables the next-generation DRAM nodes,  and is also crucial in meeting future requirements in Logic  chip production. The first shipment of our NXT:1470 was another milestone  in DUV. It is the first lithography system that produces more  than 300 wafers per hour. The NXT:1470 is also the first  ‘dry’ DUV system based on our NXT platform, which was  previously used for immersion products only. fundamentals and new developments in optical design. At  the moment the strong cooperation between ASML and  TU/e is evident through, among other things, the more than  30 PhD positions in which we, as an industrial party, are  currently involved. ASML also works with the Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence  Systems Institute (EAISI), set up by the TU/e to make the  Brainport region of Eindhoven a center for the application  of AI in engineering. EAISI focuses on the use of data and  algorithms in machines, such as robots and autonomous  cars. We are involved in the multidisciplinary project Eindhoven  Engine, which accelerates innovation in the Brainport  region. High-tech students, scientists and academics from  a wide variety of disciplines cooperate with business- oriented partners to share knowledge. They also draw on  the benefits offered by multidisciplinary collaboration in  working toward identifying new and timely technology- based solutions. We have a long lasting cooperation with Delft University of  Technology (TU/Delft). For example, ASML is participating  in the Imsys-3D program, a public-private partnership to  create next-generation high-performance motion systems.  The goal of this project is to use innovative computer  algorithms to design optimal shape and dynamic  properties of modules in our lithography machines, which  can then be 3D-printed, offering never before realized  efficiency. We also cooperate with LINX (Lensless Imaging of 3D  Nanostructures using Soft X-Rays), a collaboration  between Dutch universities and both national and  international industrial partners. With the University of Twente we have, among others, a  strong cooperation with the XUV Optics Industrial Focus  Group at the MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology. In 2020  we extended the cooperation contract with this group for  another 4 years. We work together on high-tech optical  applications of thin films. These industrial applications  require fundamental physical insights to further boost  performance of coating materials in a harsh EUV  environment. Collaborating with R&D partners  We monitor the level of engagement with our innovation  ecosystem by measuring our investments in R&D partners.  This includes investments in suppliers that innovate and  help us develop system parts or modules. We also  measure the degree to which we invite external technology  experts to share competencies with us by the number of  R&D partner agencies we engage with. Our collaboration with and investment in our wide network  of R&D partners enables us to share our expertise with the  ecosystem. Together we build a strong knowledge network  to create technological solutions that society can tap into.  In our shared projects, partners in the ecosystem take  responsibility for their own areas of expertise and invest in  these to advance their own businesses. We also cooperate with partners in research and innovation  projects subsidized by the European Union. Horizon 2020,  the EU’s program for financing European research and  innovation projects, aims to secure Europe's global  competitiveness through innovation breakthroughs,  discoveries and world-firsts. It also seeks to drive  economic growth and create jobs. In 2019, we participated  in four EU subsidy projects: TAKE5, TAKEMI5, TAPES3 and  Pin3s. In 2020, we successfully completed TAKEMI5. Its  objective is to discover, develop and demonstrate  lithographic, metrology, process and integration  technologies enabling module integration for the 5 nm  node. Together with a group of European companies and  research institutes, we run collaborative subsidy projects  aimed at advancing IC technology for the next node via  the program called 'More Moore'. For example, we are  leading the three-year PIn3S research pilot project into 3  nm semiconductor technology. It is due to be completed  in 2022. The European Union is contributing up to €30  million of the total cost of €141.6 million for this project,  as part of its objective to strengthen the European  high-tech industry. Our partners in the project include  Prodrive, Reden, Sioux CCM, Solmates, Thermo Fisher  Scientific (FEI), TU Delft, the University of Twente, VDL  ETG, imec, NOVA, KLA and Applied Materials. The PIn3S  project will form the basis for innovations yet to come,  enabling solutions that address societal challenges in  communication, mobility, healthcare, security, energy,  and safety and security. PIn3S is by far the largest of 11 research projects  launched under the umbrella of the program ‘Electronic  Components & Systems for European leadership’  (Ecsel). Ecsel is a so-called joint undertaking, a public- private partnership established in 2014 by the European  Union. It receives €1.17 billion in subsidies from the  EU’s Horizon 2020 program. National and regional  governments and project participants supplement this  subsidy by about €5 billion. This money will be spent  on research and innovation in nanoelectronics, cyber  technology and system-integration technologies. In 2020, ASML began coordinating a new EU collaboration  project, called IT2, aimed at exploring, developing and  demonstrating the technology options needed to realize 2  nm CMOS Logic IC technology. This will extend the scaled  semiconductor technology roadmap to the next node in  accordance with Moore’s Law, and further support leading- edge manufacturing. The three-year program is valued at  more than €90 million. Project activities cover the creation  of lithography equipment, processes and modules, and  metrology tools capable of creating and dealing with new 2  nm node 3D structures, defect analysis, overlay  improvement and feature size reductions. Our contribution for 2020 is nearly €28.5 million. In most of  these projects, we work with universities, research and  technology institutes and other high-tech companies to  help enable the industry to move towards next-generation  technology. The projects in the series are built around three  main pillars: lithography, metrology and process  development. It is mutually beneficial to support the  companies around us that provide us with what we need.  We push these projects and involve our ecosystem  because it is important for us to build together.  By collaborating in European projects, ASML and its  partners play a role in giving the region a degree of  sovereignty by driving and accelerating fundamental  research and groundbreaking innovation in Europe. This  collaboration also generates significant business value,  fuels job creation, and creates knowledge. This is borne  out of, for example, the increasing number of patent  requests per year, both for ASML and the other members  in the various consortia, which reflects the success of the  collaborations. Product safety  We want to innovate, but always with safety top of mind.  It’s our duty to provide a safe work environment at all  times. In our products and processes, we think about how  to supply machines where all safety risks are mitigated to  guarantee a safe place to work and deliver accordingly. We  do this at every stage of a product lifecycle: research,  development, production, transport, installation,  maintenance, upgrades and decommissioning. And we  make sure we cover all our stakeholder groups, including  employees, customers, suppliers, contractors and visitors. How we manage product safety  Safe products start with good design. As part of this  philosophy, we try to eliminate the human factor as much  as possible. We emphasize safety by design in hardware  followed by safety by procedure. Prevention is key. We  seek to ensure all the products and tools we develop  comply with the world’s most stringent product safety  regulations, and legislation applicable to the countries  where we do business. In some cases, where there are no  safety precautions available to address potential hazards,  we develop our own precautions for the tools and products  we develop at ASML. We create safe products through our technical capabilities  and design to guard against the human factor becoming a  risk factor. One example of this is the way we interlock  laser-beam activities to limit our employees' exposure to  dangerous laser beams. This helps prevent workplace  activities from turning into potential accidents. We have clear systems and processes in place to support  our approach to product safety. When we start designing  our systems, our safety engineers conduct an initial Safety  Risk Assessment (SRA). They take nine key risk areas into  account that we have identified, and alert risk experts if  they believe designs might pose a safety risk. Our product  designers are trained to identify any safety issues in the  early stages of the design process.   In each subsequent stage of the product lifecycle, we  evaluate product safety. We track any reported product- related incidents – including supply chain incidents –  through our incident-reporting system. Every year, we  provide management with a product-safety review, where  we report any product-safety incidents of the past year. In  2020, as in previous years, we are proud to say there were  no recordable incidents caused by our equipment. Before an EUV S3-modular vessel system can be  shipped to South Korea, an inspector from the South  Korean gas and safety authorities must verify the high- pressure gas system by proof-testing in the Veldhoven  cleanroom. Travel restrictions during COVID-19 meant  this step risked severely delaying clearance for shipment.  Instead, a cross-sector team from ASML was able to  demonstrate the high-pressure compliance of the EUV  S3-MV system, with South Korean authorities and  the customer viewing a live feed from the cleanroom.  Afterwards, serial numbers of the manufacturing record  book were checked and validated by showing the parts  in the system to verify that the manufacturing record  book matched the hardware in the system. With no  deviations found and good results on the pressure proof  test, the authorities approved the system, enabling  clearance for shipment of the second S3-MV system to  South Korea. As we have grown, so has our product complexity and the  number of geographical locations we operate in, and  therefore it is becoming more complex to assess which  safety legislation and regulations apply to our products and  tools. At the same time, it is also more complex to  determine the rules and procedures we need to follow to  demonstrate this compliance. Some of our technology is  so innovative and new that it is not always immediately  clear which regulatory regime applies. In 2020, we launched a legislation and compliance project  in our D&E department. Through this project, we are further  improving our ability to assess which legislation and  regulations apply in each country we operate in, how to  interpret them, and demonstrate how our products and  tools comply. As always, we provide safety documents for  our machines – including the results of the safety tests of  parts, and the machines’ functioning – taking regulatory  requirements into account. In some cases, government  regulations stipulate that safety tests must be conducted in  the presence of a licensed inspector. This presented  several challenges due to global travel restrictions and  quarantine measurements. The legislation and compliance project has led to updates  of the Safety System Performance Specification (Safety  SPS) – the list of safety and compliance requirements our  D&E department maintains for our products and tools. The  Safety SPS is formally updated every three years and on  an ongoing basis for changes in relevant legislation. In 2020, we continued to run pilot projects aimed at  ensuring our suppliers are abreast of all relevant safety  specifications. The legislation and compliance project has  led to updates of the Safety SPS, the list of safety and  compliance requirements our D&E department maintains  for our products and tools. We share this information with  our suppliers prior to them manufacturing the parts,  modules and/or tools for us. We expect our suppliers to  also provide safety-related data and supporting  documentation for the parts or tools they make for us. We  screen suppliers to assess how they are meeting these  safety requirements. We completed a project aimed at adopting best practices  related to the shipping of dangerous goods. This resulted  in, among other things, the appointment of a specialist Our D&E safety competence leads are on hand to  provide thorough knowledge about the way of working  and design rules around specific safety hazards. The  products and tools we develop comply with the EU  Safety Directives and semiconductor industry guidelines  (SEMI S2) to ensure product safety is taken into account  at all times. These guidelines are incorporated in the  Safety System Performance Specification (Safety SPS).  We also take into account customer-specific safety  guidelines. We are SEMI S2 compliant for every product type  shipped. In 2020, a report confirming SEMI S2  compliance was available for every product type we  shipped. We also have a CE declaration of conformity for  all ASML products and tools. Sharing our expertise is a way to strengthen our regional  high-tech ecosystem. This region has a competitive edge  globally, and we need to make sure we maintain this  position. Building a strong regional foundation benefits not  just ASML and associated partners, but also other  companies and organizations. It also helps attract a broad  base of talent to the region. dedicated to the technical competence ‘dangerous goods’.  We focused on increasing our knowledge of the thousands  of potentially hazardous items we produce and ship  worldwide every year. By identifying at an early stage which  materials are hazardous, we can take measures for their  safe handling and transportation in time, and with more  efficiency. RoHS and REACH We are committed to complying with EU guidelines for  handling hazardous materials and chemicals, the so-called  RoHS directive and the REACH regulation, even though the  products we manufacture are currently excluded from the  RoHS directive. We aim to, whenever possible, reduce and  eliminate any use of hazardous substances and replace  non-compliant parts with RoHS-compliant alternatives. REACH regulations are ever changing, which presents a  potential challenge. Each year, there are new additions to  the hazardous substances list. As ASML machines consist  of thousands of parts not manufactured at ASML locations,  we need to keep in very close communication with our  suppliers to identify the Substances of Very High Concern  (SVHC) content of our products. However, our huge  supplier portfolio and six-monthly updates of the SVHC list  means this process is challenging. Currently, there are  more than 250 hazardous chemicals that need to be  assessed. In 2020, our D&E department launched a project to update  our REACH policy and further embed REACH compliance  in D&E’s operations at all our locations and in our  worldwide supply chain. Our REACH project, which will  continue in 2021, includes training stakeholders to  familiarize them with REACH requirements. The project  also aims to align our policy and procedures with new EU  legislation and the EU ‘SCIP’ database of hazardous  materials. Supporting startups and scaleups   We are now 36 years old, but it’s our startup mentality –  one that is innovative, adaptable and purpose-driven – that  has helped us grow into the multinational company we are  today. We believe an inclusive and sustainable innovation  ecosystem can unleash dynamic and competitive  technologies that provide new solutions to society’s  challenges. To nurture innovation by new generations of  technological talents, we also recognize that our expertise  is valuable in supporting entrepreneurs and startups. We make use of our experts’ in-depth competencies and  knowledge to support startups and scaleups. By fostering  entrepreneurship, we aim to help these young enterprises  excel and grow. What we share is based on what we are  good at, like building complex manufacturing systems.  This is where we can play a role and make a difference. Our employees benefit from the work with startups too.  Placing our people into startup teams during certain  phases of programs is a way to further develop  entrepreneurial thinking within our company. In 2020, we provided around 1,550 hours of support to  high-tech startups and scaleups. The total value of our in- kind support is around €0.6 million. ASML as a venture-builder  Through the Eindhoven Startup Alliance, we have  supported startups and scaleups in their various stages  over the years in collaboration with other tech-minded  peers from our region. In 2020, we further developed and  mapped out a new focus area started in 2019: becoming a  startup venture-builder. Every startup goes through similar phases as it strives to  become the next world-class company: 'Dream' (ambition),  'Stand' (idea), 'Step' (problem statement and solution) and  'Walk' (value proposition). Each individual phase of this life  cycle presents unique challenges. Through sharing our  expertise, together with HighTechXL, we aim to support  startups along their journey. We monitor and assess their  maturity through objective assessment and a set of  deliverables per KPI, such as business model, finance,  technology, sustainability and execution skills. After successful completion of phase 'Walk', the startup  evolves to a scaleup, ready to generate its first revenue and  seeking ways to expand to a mature business model. We  offer support to scaleups. By providing them access into  our ecosystem and sharing our knowledge, together with  the Make Next Platform, we help them grow into a  sustainable company. Insights we’ve gained in recent years showed that our past  successes were based on working with scaled-up startups  with a ‘deep tech’ component, and that these were difficult  to find. The solution was to build our own in partnership  with other technology providers. In 2019, we chose a  promising – existing but innovative – technology, and  selected a team of experts from the region to build a  startup company based on this licensed technology (Read  more in: Incooling combating waste heat). In 2020, we further developed this initiative, reaching  agreements with several companies and organizations,  including TNO, imec, the European Space Agency and  Fraunhofer, to work together to build new deep-tech  companies. This shift in focus takes the existing high-tech  startup accelerator HighTechXL, in which we have been a  partner since its launch in 2016, and moves it into the next  development phase. ASML was involved in two HighTechXL FasTrackathons in  2020, focused on deep-tech venture building. Teams made  up of around 16 different nationalities, and different ages,  backgrounds, skills and competencies, came together to  explore synergies and work towards bringing new  companies to fruition. In March, the FasTrackathon  had to move online. The   event was recreated as a virtual hackathon while keeping  the collaboration philosophy of the original – introductions,  team familiarizations, brainstorming, business plans and,  finally, the pitches that are the first step toward strangers  becoming effective startup teams. Eindhoven Startup Alliance  Over the years, we’ve provided in-kind support to new  companies at different stages of development.  For  startups that have moved beyond the stage of an idea, we  offer support through two initiatives: the Eindhoven Startup  Alliance, together with HighTechXL, and the Make Next  Platform. We set up the Eindhoven Startup Alliance in 2016 with six  tech-minded peers from the region to boost innovation and  entrepreneurship in the Eindhoven Brainport area. The  alliance facilitates collaboration between multinational  corporations, SMEs, research institutes and government. It  supports promising new companies with the aim of  accelerating their development and strengthening the  ecosystem for high-tech manufacturing in the region.  Since its inception, the Eindhoven Startup Alliance has built  a portfolio of about 70 startups. Of these, more than 60%  are still in business, while about 16% have achieved the  steep growth envisioned by the alliance and as such have  been awarded the alliance’s ‘Star’ status. A supported  high-tech start-up is assumed to have reached 'Star Level'  once it's business value has multiplied by more than 10  times. Although we gained momentum with our new approach in  2020, progress was hampered. We had to organize  ourselves offline, with associated challenges around  communications and logistics. And while the spend rate of  startup companies is relatively low, some ran into financial  difficulty. ASML helped to arrange funding and subsidies  for some of these. Overall, many startups had to rearrange  their priorities. Established with ASML’s support at the start of 2019,  Incooling uses cooling technology developed by CERN,  the European Organization for Nuclear Research,  to address one of the datacenter industry's major  challenges: waste heat. It is predicted that by 2025 no  less than 20% of global energy consumption will be  consumed by datacenters. A large part of this energy is  needed for cooling. This produces 1.9 gigatons of CO2  (equivalent to the annual emissions of the aviation and  shipping industry combined). Incooling has developed  highly efficient cooling systems that in the future will offer  datacenters higher performance against substantially  lower energy consumption. This young venture has accelerated in a very short  period of time and, with ASML’s collaboration, has  been recognized with the first CoSta* Award for the  most successful and impactful innovative collaboration  between a corporate and a startup. The award  acknowledges the wide-ranging support offered by  ASML in helping the young company establish itself and  tap into the fast-moving innovation ecosystem. *The CoSta program of Dutch employers alliance VNO- NCW and MKB Nederland was set up to stimulate  cooperation between corporates and startups. high-tech technology, a category the alliance dubbed  ‘deep-tech’. Supporting startups that work with these  sophisticated technologies creates more value for alliance  partners and the Eindhoven region.  In 2020, we moved  forward with this new focus area. The Eindhoven Startup Alliance had a total of eight  companies using a licensed technology in the pipeline at  year-end 2020. Our goal over the next five years is to  establish about 45 startup companies through the alliance  based on this technology licensing model. Our own target  is to help at least 20% of startups reach the ‘Star’ level. We encourage ASML staff to join alliance projects and help  startups by sharing their expertise, which also benefits our  innovation and business processes. Not only do our  experts gain knowledge about new technologies, they also  get the opportunity to experience the different stages of a  young company’s evolution – from developing a product  proposition to going to market and needing to find  customers. We believe this makes our top experts better  leaders and all-rounders. Make Next Platform   We set up the Make Next Platform to help young  technology companies that have moved beyond the  startup phase and are ready to expand. This platform  provides the future generation of tech companies with a  unique opportunity to gain access to the networks,  knowledge and expertise of the leading Dutch companies  in the technology industry.    These companies, so-called scaleups, face challenges  such as finding the funding needed to grow, knowing how  to target new customer groups, and recruiting new  employees with the right skills. Through exchange of best  practices, business experience and coaching, the Make  Next Platform partners aim to support them in their  development to become global players by giving them  access to the inside networks. Together with ASML, the Make Next Platform partners  include, for example, the engineering company Huisman,  airport logistics specialist Vanderlande, and aerospace,  defense, public transport and security-systems specialist  Thales NL. The Dutch non-profit Stichting Technology Rating provides  due diligence services that help the Make Next Platform  select companies it wants to support. In 2020, support for scaleups took a different form. There  was a more focused and urgent need for funding to see  companies through the lockdown period. In some cases,  ASML and the CEOs of founding companies arranged  letters of support for the companies we support. One of the scaleups we supported in 2020 was Medtech  company IME Medical Electrospinning, which was  admitted to the Make Next platform in March. The  company is a global leader in electrospun medical devices  and regenerative medicine. IME has developed the  revolutionary MediSpin® XL platform for large-scale  industrial production of reproducible and scalable fiber- based scaffolds for medical devices. The platform ensures  control of the crucial parameters of the electrospinning  process, leading to identical and consistent end-products.  It also allows for non-stop production, while safeguarding ASML Makers Award  We support new companies at different stages of  development. For those seeking to transform a high-tech  idea into a business case, we offer help in kind. ASML  experts make themselves available for an agreed number  of hours to share knowledge and experience with these  startups. We provide this support to winners of our ASML  Makers Award. These are usually university students or  young scholars who successfully pitched an as-yet  embryonic high-tech innovation or prototypes. In 2020, we granted the ASML Makers Award to a team of  students from TU/e for their business case on a ‘Bicycle  lighting solution’, aimed at encouraging cyclists to use  bicycle lights by designing an easy-to-use product. The  small, pocketable bicycle light is easily attachable to a  keychain, so reducing the chance of loss and theft. the structure of the fibers and thus the quality of the  medical mesh. We also supported the Enschede startup Sound Energy,  which has developed a sustainable machine that can cool  industrial processes with sound waves using residual heat.  In this way, the company creates an air conditioner that  uses hardly any electricity. And for large factories and  ships, its Thermo Acoustic Energy Converter can save up  to 88% energy. Technology and innovation ecosystem KPIs  The table below shows the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the related 2025 targets. In 2019, we adopted a new  sustainability strategy – as a result no comparative results for 2018 are available for new performance indicators. See Non- financial statements - Non-financial indicators for our performance indicators (PIs) and related results. Contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals  Our ambitions, commitments and programs as described in this chapter contribute to the following SDGs. For more  information on the performance, see section Non-financial statements - Non-financial indicators. SDG target 9.1 - Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure,  including regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic  development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable  access for all. SDG target 9.4 - By 2030, upgrade infrastructure and retrofit industries to make  them sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of  clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes, with all  countries taking action in accordance with their respective capabilities. SDG target 9.5 - Enhance scientific research, upgrade technological capabilities  of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries. For  developing countries, this includes, by 2030, encouraging innovation and  increasing the number of research and development workers per one million  people, as well as public and private research and development spending.

We develop our  solutions based on their input, engage in helping them  achieve their technology and cost roadmaps, and work  together, often literally in the same team, to make sure our  solutions match. In 2020, the global COVID-19 pandemic shaped our  approach to how we continue to support our customers. It  drove us to devise creative support solutions and  collaborate with our customers in a number of different  ways, to make sure we could serve them around the globe  without significant interruption. From the start, our account teams stayed in constant  communication with the regions affected by the pandemic  as it unfolded. In alignment with our corporate crisis team,  we ramped up our customer communications, providing  more frequent status updates, usually through weekly or  bi-weekly calls. Despite travel restrictions, mandatory quarantine and  manpower constraints, and thanks to our collaborative  efforts across the company and our business partners, we  were able to prevent any major impact on our customer  business requirements. Customers around the world have  recognized our additional support efforts and interventions  during the pandemic. We were presented with several  ‘customer awards’ in recognition of our rapid response to  customers' needs and good overall customer service. Achieving customer intimacy  To us, customer intimacy is about the entire customer  relationship across all channels, from the early stages of  innovation onwards. We aim to foster loyalty, advocacy and  continuous engagement with the goal of achieving  complete customer satisfaction. As we responded to the unique situations present in  2020, our new ability to provide remote support became  a game-changer. A cross-functional team used gaming- inspired augmented reality (AR) to turn a potential  problem – delays in providing customer support – into  a new opportunity, ushering in a new era of remote  support. We developed an AR solution using Microsoft 3D  HoloLens headsets that allows subject-matter experts to  enter customer cleanrooms virtually to both troubleshoot  and complete service actions. Using AR, we are now  able to have our top experts support our machines from  anywhere in the world. As ASML matures and grows, our innovations lead to more  sophisticated solutions and interactions with our  customers. As customer requirements become more  complex, it takes longer to align, so we need to start earlier.  Transparency is key in this process, and our customer  intimacy strategy supports this. It’s crucial to be in a true partnership with our customers,  to share in the risks and rewards of what we do. Trust and  a shared vision are at the heart of this. Staying close to our customer To support and sustain our partnerships with customers,  we have a structure of customer interactions across  various channels in the organization, including, for  example, customer alignment meetings. Here, members of  our Board of Management, senior managers and customer  representatives come together to make sure our product  development plans are in line with their business goals and  needs.  We run regular customer alignment meetings with our key  customers. These meetings include our Executive Review  Meetings, at which members of our senior management  team and Board of Management discuss business and  strategies with customers; Technology Review Meetings, at  which our senior technology experts and CTO discuss  technology plans and requirements with customers, and  Operational Review Meetings, where we review topics  related to our customers’ operational activities. We have a dedicated Sales and Customer Management  department, which is responsible for building and  maintaining our customer relationships and ensuring all  relevant ASML departments contribute to meeting their  needs. We market and sell our products directly to our  customers, without agencies or other intermediaries. Our  account managers, field and application engineers, and  service and technical support specialists are located  throughout Asia, the US and Europe. Another focus area is training – boosting the capabilities of  the local customer service teams as well as enhancing  local technical expertise. The travel restrictions, among  others, highlighted just how essential the need is for well- trained engineers in the regions where we operate. We opened two EUV technology training centers in 2020,  one in Hwasung in South Korea and one in Tainan in  Taiwan. Bringing service engineers up to speed on our  technology is critical to the industrialization of EUV. The  EUV training center enables both ASML and our customers  to train EUV engineers locally in a safe and cost-effective  way. Our customer support engineers have gone above  and beyond to continue supporting our customers  throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including the use  of ASML’s remote service capability: Basic Remote  Equipment Support (BRES). BRES allows engineers  to check error logs, diagnostic reports, and even ‘see’  a machine screen remotely in certain locations. Our  customer support team relied heavily on this capability  to solve machine issues quickly – without any face-to- face interaction. It also allowed specialists from other  locations to provide support. The new training center in Tainan features live EUV  machine modules and comprehensive training courses to  train EUV engineers for EUV customers, including EUV  machine operating practice in the cleanroom. Measuring our approach Our Voice of the Customer program helps ensure our  employees hear firsthand about our customers’ needs and  challenges. This is especially important for employees  without direct access to customers. To reach as many of  our people as possible, the program makes use of different  channels of communication: live presentations and Q&As  with senior customer representatives, recorded customer  interviews, online articles, and personal engagement with  customer representatives based near our offices in  Veldhoven. In 2020, travel restrictions and other mitigation  measures related to COVID-19 limited our in-person  interactions. Our account teams adapted quickly, introducing alternative  solutions such as more local Voice of the Customer  initiatives and remote customer interviews. Local account  and support teams visited our customers at their locations,  interviewed them on video, and then shared feedback with  teams at ASML. Except for live presentations with a bigger  audience, we could adhere to our regular schedule of  interactions throughout the year.   Another valuable customer feedback tool is our biennial  Customer Feedback Survey, which asks our customers to  rate our performance. We also use this opportunity to  collect open feedback. The direct ratings and frank  comments provide valuable insight into customers’  successes and challenges. It presents them with questions  on the most important areas of improvement for our  account teams and business sectors. Overall Loyalty Score (Customer Feedback Survey)  73.3% n/a 72.6% VLSI Survey results Large suppliers of chipmaking equipment - score (scale 0 to 10) 9.1 9.2 9.3 Suppliers of Fab equipment - score (scale 0 to 10) 9.1 9.2 9.3 Technical leadership for lithography equipment - score (scale 0 to 10) 9.6 9.6 9.7 We ran the survey in 2020, and drawing on the results,  identified improvement areas. Common themes include  driving timely solutions to structural problems, improving  quality and cost of ownership. We shared these findings  with business sectors and other relevant internal  stakeholders. We also set ourselves a target of achieving a top-three  ranking among large suppliers of semiconductor  equipment. The VLSI research annual Customer  Satisfaction Survey benchmarks the performance of  suppliers across the semiconductor industry. The 2020  VLSI research Customer Satisfaction Survey saw us  achieve our highest-ever score, with an average rating of  9.3 out of 10, up from 9.2 in 2019. We've maintained our  position in the top three overall ‘Large Suppliers of  Chipmaking Equipment’ and also top three individual  categories: ‘Best Suppliers of Fab Equipment’, ‘Wafer to  Foundation Chipmakers’, and ‘Wafer Fabrication  Equipment to Specialty Chipmakers’. In line with our business strategy, we continued in 2020 to  work towards securing our full product portfolio that will  sustain our company into the future. This includes bringing  EUV to high-volume manufacturing at customer sites, and  securing our products in the mature markets and installed  base and service offering.  Our product portfolio is aligned to industry trends and our  customers’ detailed product roadmaps, which require  lithography-enabled solutions. Our strategy is clearly  resonating with our customers. They are showing their trust  in us by investing in our newest technology, supporting the  industry driver of shrink beyond the current decade. Operational excellence ASML has achieved strong growth over the past few years,  thanks to groundbreaking innovations and technology  leadership. We’ve introduced several generations of  cutting-edge chipmaking systems and built a strong  market position in the semiconductor equipment  manufacturing industry. As we mature as a company and  build on this position, we are putting effort into ways to  continuously improve the customer experience and help  customers reduce the cost of ownership. Customers look  at both the cost of the systems and running costs. As  such, improving quality requires an end-to-end approach.  We need to look at the whole chain to identify the real  issues and find solutions. We seek to combine our  innovation power with operational excellence. Our New Enterprise program The strong growth in our business operations and the  evolution of the company drove us to review our work  practices and determine where we can increase efficiency  in our operational processes to improve the customer  experience and unlock business value. We put ample effort  in reshaping our processes and IT landscape. The Our New  Enterprise (ONE) program is centered on improving our  business processes and IT enterprise management  system. It builds on the steps taken in recent years to  improve our IT systems, which were built in the 1990s and  not optimized for tailored customer solutions. This is a  multi-year program, with the rollout being done in phases. The ONE program addresses the complex processes that  have resulted from a fragmented application landscape  with numerous customized applications. The aim is to  ensure flexibility while introducing standardization. ONE will  enable ASML to function in a more unified and efficient  way by simplifying processes to ensure a future-proof and  more sustainable system. The program adopts a cross- sector, company-wide, and end-to-end approach that will  enable us to deliver higher business value for our  stakeholders, which we define as: Quality culture ASML is committed to providing a high level of customer  satisfaction by delivering top-quality, sustainable products  and services that consistently meet, or exceed, our  customers’ expectations. Quality and operational  excellence are essential elements of our technology  leadership. This leadership is reinforced by a company- wide quality culture that creates an environment to excel.  Together with our suppliers and partners, we ensure high- level performance for our products and services. As a  learning organization, we continuously improve our  offerings and processes. • First Time Right: Apply risk management processes on  products and execution to minimize the impact for our  customers. • Zero defect: Embed controls to guarantee adherence to  our policies, processes and procedures. • Zero repeat: Learn from failures and prevent  reoccurrence, driving structural improvement in our  products, services and processes. We have established a Quality Program Review Board,  chaired by our Chief Operating Officer (COO), tasked with  steering and monitoring on quality. We are also committed  to internationally recognized quality management systems  and standards. Our quality-management system complies  with the ISO 9001:2015 standard, and in November 2020  we again received third-party re-certification for the next  three years. This demonstrates our robust quality  governance, effective quality management system, and  quality compliance across the company. The ZEISS projection lenses in our DUV systems are  usually serviced on-site by ZEISS engineers traveling  from South Korea, Taiwan, the US and Germany. To  make sure we could continue to service our customers  efficiently, especially in the face of travel restrictions, our  customer service engineers looked for ways to reduce  the need for on-site support from ZEISS. And they found a way: by freeing up machine time  and having a resident ZEISS engineer train local CS  engineers from China, Japan and Singapore in the  TWINSCAN factory in Veldhoven, local ASML engineers  are now able to cover those locations. With local ZEISS  engineers continuing to cover South Korea, Taiwan, the  US and Europe, support has increased on critical-service  actions from less than 70% to more than 90% coverage. Every day, our employees come together to unlock the  potential of each nanometer to break new ground. Without  our diverse and highly educated workforce, we wouldn’t be  able to push the limits of technology. Therefore, we want to  offer our people the best possible employee experience at  all our sites, enabling them to develop their talent, feel  respected and work to the best of their abilities. Providing  the best possible employee experience enables us to  attract and retain the best talent. In 2020, we were faced with an unprecedented global  crisis, the effects of which reached into every corner of our  lives and across every aspect of our business. From one  day to the next, we had to change how we were used to  doing things. From a people perspective, we had to  transform how we organized ourselves, our way of  working, our day-to-day lives at ASML, and how we  attracted new talent to the company. Operationally, we were able to continue with our business  activities and priorities, but the way we worked, learned  and interacted with each other and our stakeholders  changed significantly. This was challenging, but there have  been positive outcomes, such as new ways of working, the  ability to collaborate remotely and, in some cases, faster  progress with some of our plans. Our primary goal is to make sure, as best as we can, that  our colleagues and their families around the world stay  safe. Our second goal is to make sure we continue to serve  our customers. As an employer, we provide a safe work  environment, but we rely on our employees to take  personal responsibility to protect themselves and those  around them, both at work and in their personal lives. And  at all times, we follow government guidelines. Gradually, we will work on defining how to resume regular  business activities. We were and still are in different phases  of these priorities in the countries and regions where we  operate. Empowering individuals for the collective good to ensure ouremployees are proud to work for us and engaged with  our ambitions as a company. Strengthening our company culture   ASML’s workforce has grown steeply in recent years. This  strong growth in total workforce, the large number of new  employees, and the evolution of the company has driven  us to review what we stand for as a company and  determine how we can help our people embrace our values  and familiarize themselves with our strategy and purpose.  We need to provide a unified direction and anchor ASML’s  identity deep in the organization. Given the significant number of new employees who have  joined the company in recent years, we need to be even  more explicit about what we stand for, articulating the  values that should guide the way we work together. Based  on employee feedback, we’ve developed a representative  set of values: Challenge, Collaborate and Care. These  values ensure we are all working from a commonly  understood base that can be applied across our  organization, and guide us in our dealings with colleagues,  customers, suppliers, shareholders and the communities  we serve. (Read more in: Who we are and what we do -  Our core values). In 2020, with our refreshed company purpose and values  statement in place, we focused on further deploying our  culture and values framework, and implementing our  values in our day-to-day work. One of the ways we did this was to set up a Culture  Ambassadors workgroup. This network of 120 cultural  ambassadors from all levels of the organization has been  tasked with helping leaders and employees anchor our  corporate values and behaviors in daily routines. Their role  is to understand the values, live them by example, and  connect with others in the organization to promote them.  We see them as multiplicators within ASML, to help embed  our culture and way of thinking. This process of embedding  our values is an ongoing journey, but we will make good  progress if we can begin to apply them every day. Employee engagement Employee engagement is critical to the performance of our  organization and our long-term success as a company.  Boosting engagement depends on a wide variety of factors  and activities, such as talent attraction and retention,  onboarding experience, leadership, learning and  development and labor practices. Our we@ASML employee engagement survey is a crucial  tool for collecting and measuring employee feedback. The  insights our survey provides enable us to improve the  employee experience and work on our policies and  processes. Our ambition is to have a highly engaged  workforce. We set ourselves the target of achieving an  employee engagement score that is at least on a par with  our peers. We are proud of the progress we made on this in the  challenging context of 2020. Our overall employee  engagement level is high, up from 77%  in 2019 to 80% in 2020 – 7% above our external global  benchmark of 73%. We have shown improvement on  topics such as quality, well-being, inclusiveness, and  customer focus. Also impacting this upward trend is our  positive response to COVID-19, which external research  shows influences company engagement scores. We still see clear differences in engagement levels, across  regions and departments. And while the three priority areas  from we@ASML 2019 – ‘Enabling Processes’, ‘Cross-team  Collaboration’ and ‘Clarity of Expectations’ – have all  improved significantly this year, they are still top of the  agenda, as we still score well below the external  benchmark. For example, following on from issues raised  in the 2019 we@ASML feedback, the Brion executive team The 2020 FTEs in the chart above do not include the FTEs acquired through the acquisition of Berliner Glas Group. Payroll employees (FTE) Temporary employees (FTE) Attrition rate % 2,997 How we grew in 2020 We hired 1,932 new payroll employees in 2020, growing  our workforce to 26,481 FTE at year-end, excluding the  almost 1,600 FTE joining from the Berliner Glas acquisition.  This is a sharp increase compared to the 14,681 FTEs we  employed in 2015.   Our attrition rate – the percentage of employees leaving our  company – was significantly below that of our industry,  meaning we again met our target. After a few years of  modest increase – though always remaining well below  that of our industry – our attrition rate significantly  decreased in 2020, standing at 3.8% versus 4.3% in 2019.  This shows that our efforts to create a unique employee  experience, our employee engagement programs, and our  onboarding of new employees are paying off. Of course, in  2020 this was also shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic,  which may have resulted in people being less inclined to  look for other jobs. While attrition can open up a knowledge gap in the  company, we also view it as an opportunity to bring in new  talent and enhance existing talent. We strive for a healthy  attrition rate, currently aiming for between 3.0% and 8.0%.  For high performers, our target is to have a rate 50% lower  than the overall attrition rate target. The attrition rate of our  high performers was 1.7% in 2020, outperforming our  target. launched a new virtual event – known as Product Day in  the US and Product Week in China – to better enable  cross-team collaboration. Through these events,  employees were able to quickly learn about products,  share in customer successes, and foster collaboration to  inspire new ideas. Building a strong talent pool  In an innovative, high-tech, fast-changing industry, it’s vital  to strengthen and continuously invest in our talent pool to  anticipate evolving business requirements and  developments in the labor market. We empower our  employees to develop their talent, pursue their career  ambitions and to thrive. We strongly believe that personal  development works best when our employees can invest in  themselves. At ASML, we give employees the time,  opportunity and support, while they put in the effort,  passion and drive needed to enhance their development.  We offer tailor-made training and development programs to  help grow the highly skilled professionals we employ at  ASML. Training To maintain our technological leadership and pace of  innovation, we need to ensure the right knowledge is  available to our people at the right time. To do this, we  have our own technical development centers in-house for  our D&E, customer support, and manufacturing employees  to tailor training to the specific technical needs of these  departments.  Most of our trainings take place on the job, given the  nature of our innovative business and co-value creation.  Overall, we are promoting the 70-20-10 approach for  learning interventions, meaning that 70% is on the job  learning, 20% is through coaching, and 10% is learning  through training courses. The average number of training  hours in this last category, including development  programs, was 28 hours per employee in 2020. In 2020, we increased virtual training. We had been looking  into adopting this over time but accelerated our efforts due  to COVID-19. We dedicated a lot of time and effort to  adapting this training during the year. There were some  challenges as it was not possible to make all our training  virtual. For example, we postponed some of the development  activities that have a strong networking component to  them, ones where we needed to bring different sectors and  countries together. Due to travel restrictions and different  time zones, these activities were not viable. With the world’s largest installed base of EUV systems,  Asia leads the way in EUV adoption. Getting service  engineers up to speed on this technology is critical not  only to ensure they can service this fast-moving location,  but also to the overall industrialization of EUV – which  is why ASML has opened new EUV training centers in  Tainan (Taiwan) and Hwasung (South Korea) in 2020.  It can take more than a year for an EUV engineer to  develop the skills needed to work independently. With  these long development times and ongoing travel  uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, these  EUV training centers enable ASML and our customers to  train engineers locally in a safe and cost-effective way,  bringing EUV knowledge to where it is needed most. Career development opportunities  Developing our people is crucial to the sustained success  of our business. Employee development is never a straight  line as employees are at different stages in their employee  journey and have different needs. We offer various career  paths and have various tools in place to support our  employees’ career navigation. We are continuously looking into ways to improve how we  can help employees identify opportunities for professional  development within ASML. In 2020, we started the discussion and thinking process  around how our performance management approach and  philosophy can better align with our refreshed culture and  values. This forms part of a broader look at the future of  performance management in the company. We know that if  we want to deploy our culture and values in a certain way,  we need to weave it into certain processes, including  performance management, which we will start doing in  2021. Together with our executive committee, we started  defining how to do this more fundamentally in coming  years, looking ahead to a proposed go-live date for a new  performance management approach in 2022. In addition, we started working on redesigning specific  development programs to establish an effective mix  between remote and in-person training, addressing how  we can bring people from different locations together, and  how to make training more digestible for online purposes. Strengthening our leadership  To remain a market leader, we must provide unified direction. This means we need authentic leadership to give our  people a clear picture of where ASML is heading. As our company grows, so does the need for clarity around roles and  expectations. Leaders need to play a part here in providing role clarity for employees, as well as being clear about their  own roles and responsibilities. We need to formulate and capture this more clearly so our people can better understand  what is expected of them. In response, we started to develop a Leadership Framework in 2020, which will set out clear  guidelines of what we expect from our leaders. The framework outlines and clarifies a leader’s role in  business leadership, role-modeling the values within the  company, and what it means to be a people manager and  coach for employees. This Leadership Framework was  officially launched in October 2020 at ASML’s Annual  Global Leadership Conference, attended by around 3,000  leaders and people managers within ASML. At the same time, we are deploying behavioral  competencies to inspire and enable personal development.  We have leadership programs where we fast-track the  careers of our most promising managers through our  Potential Acceleration Program. These programs ensure  our managers are aware of what’s expected of them, and  help them develop the skills and competencies they need  to become better leaders. Onboarding as a joint effort  As our global workforce grows exponentially, onboarding  has become one of our key priorities. A positive onboarding experience builds a sense of  connection, helps employees fit in quickly, and boosts  retention. We believe onboarding is a joint effort, driven by  everyone. It is now two and a half years since our new  onboarding program started, and the benefits of an aligned  and improved onboarding experience are clear. We have  decreased new hire attrition by 20% and pulse surveys  show a 6% increase in how new hires positively rate their  onboarding experience. More importantly, new colleagues  have indicated a positive increase of 11% in how  supported they felt by managers during their onboarding  period. Strong employer branding  With the demand for top-tier talent increasing year-on-year,  employer branding is a vital strategy to ensure ASML gets  its share of this talent. Our strong growth means we need  to hire large numbers of employees. Highly skilled people  with a technical background are scarce in the labor market  and competition is growing. We see that top-tier talent  selects their employer of choice, not the other way around.  This is a general development of employees choosing their  future employer, and it’s important for employees that a  potential employer has a proper value proposition. to a completely new way of doing things, yet pulled  together to replace first-person interactions. To give new  colleagues the best possible start, hiring managers and HR  teams across the globe created a virtual onboarding  experience. Previously, in-person elements like our  Onboarding Day connected new colleagues with each  other to learn more about all aspects of ASML. For now,  they take place completely online, with teams finding  creative virtual ways to make new colleagues feel welcome  and part of their teams. Campus walkabouts for new hires  at Veldhoven were adapted to a virtual setting, including  gamification elements. We began developing virtual games and business  simulation tools to make onboarding more fun and  efficient. Sectors, business lines and functions also  continue to build on our global onboarding initiatives,  making sure we’re providing one consistent experience  across the company, further tailored to the various  departments. In 2020, we finalized all the building blocks of the program,  bringing it to the framework stage. Developed in 2019, our employee value proposition defines  who we are, what we stand for, and how we create a  unique employee experience. It forms the basis of our  recruitment strategy and Labor Market Communication  program. In 2020, our Labor Market Communication team  took feedback from this new employee value proposition  and translated it into tailored strategies in the countries  where we operate. We view recruitment as an ongoing process, and  continuously seek to improve and professionalize how we  go about it. We use this information to fine-tune our target  audiences and recruitment efforts. More than ever, the internet is the optimal platform to  communicate. Our labor market communications team is  continuously working to optimize how we reach, inform  and engage our target audiences online. To leverage  recruitment efforts, we facilitate job postings and manage  ASML’s presence on online social network channels. We  also promote the ASML employer brand through online  advertising. We continue to improve our employer brand and values  on our corporate website, creating a better understanding  of what we do and what we stand for as an employer. We  measure how ASML is perceived by external audiences –  and potential employees in particular – by monitoring our  position in an independent external employer-branding  ranking. We have defined targets for the different local  labor markets on our positioning by 2025. See Our people  KPIs  Our efforts have been positively received. For example, in  June 2020, ASML was named the winner of 2020 Top  Graduate Employers of China by recruiters 51job.com and  yingjiesheng.com. The award recognized ASML's long- term campus recruitment plan as being a vital part of our  HR strategy. ASML has recruited college graduates for  many years, supported dynamic campus talk and science  knowledge sharing events, and earned broad recognition  and a positive reputation among students. In 2020, restrictions on travel and large group gatherings  limited our ability to meet future talent in person. Various  planned activities were either postponed or adapted to a  virtual space. Promoting diversity and inclusion We believe a diverse and inclusive workforce provides the  necessary mix of voices and points of view required to  develop the best solutions and ideas for how we innovate  to drive our business forward. We know a great idea can  come from anyone, so we foster a culture where different  identities, backgrounds, talents and passions are valued  and celebrated. With employees from 120 different  nationalities, we're proud of our diversity, and believe it  makes us stronger. Our Code of Conduct is our guiding principle to ensure all  employees are treated fairly and equally without  discrimination. We are committed to equal opportunities,  regardless of gender, age, religion, nationality, sexual  orientation, and so on. By putting the right person into the  right position, we enable our employees to contribute to  the company where they are most needed, and which  allows them to develop with the company. Our Ethics  Office and Liaisons, as well as a third-party Speak Up  Service, ensures we uphold and correct any potential  issues to maintain and protect an inclusive environment.  Additionally, our corporate values further embed respect  for our people and their differences within daily work  experiences and interpersonal interactions. In 2020, we made progress in gender diversity among all  employees and senior management. Female employees  now make up 17% of our workforce worldwide, having  gradually moved up from 10% in 2010. We deploy many  initiatives to promote STEM (science, technology,  engineering and math) education among the future female  talent pool. However, the effect of these initiatives takes  many years to become visible in our performance. In  addition, looking at the dynamics of our workforce, nearly  90% of job positions are STEM related, while peers in the  high-tech industry have more diverse, non-STEM related  job positions. Overall, the global STEM talent pool is scarce  and it is even more challenging to recruit female talent. Our  female senior management teams moved up from 9.6% in  2019 to 10.5% in 2020 to include greater gender diversity.  Yet we still have work to do in this area. Gender diversity is a general concern in the technology  industry. Historically, there is a lower ratio of women  compared to men in technology and science-related  studies. Although ASML continuously seeks to recruit and  retain women in our workforce, male candidates still make An example of our online recruitment efforts is in Taiwan  where, to support customer production, our team  showed some real agility and adaptability. ASML Taiwan  took part in a virtual press conference hosted by one  of the most influential career websites in Taiwan. ASML  Taiwan’s Senior HR Manager was invited to the press  conference and interacted with the press through a  smartphone. ASML also hosted online career talks. With all  physical events being cancelled, our Taiwan Labor  Communications team found new ways to proactively  approach prospective talents by shifting all career- oriented communications events online.  Following  successful collaboration across different sectors, ASML  Career Talk LIVE was born. up most of the labor market in STEM (science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics) fields. Aiming to close the  gender gap in STEM across the world, we continue to  implement organizational strategies to recruit, retain and  empower women at ASML. To increase the number of  females in our future talent pool, we run an intensive  technology promotion program to foster interest among  young girls. We also raise awareness of career prospects in  a sector offering many development opportunities. Still, we  need to improve our gender diversity, and we see an  effective gender policy as a challenge. See Non-financial  statements - Non-financial indicators for details on  Diversity & inclusion. In 2020, we worked on developing and formalizing our  approach to diversity and inclusion. To foster greater understanding and inclusion across our  diverse populations, we have employee network groups –  like Pink ASML to promote LGBTI people. We are a  member of the Workplace Pride organization, which is an  international platform for LGBTI inclusion at work. We also  promote the inclusion of people with disabilities and other  characteristics protected by law. Although we have worked  a lot on this, we have not reached the level of integration  we’d like to see. This remains one of our challenges. Regional achievements Supported by managers and leaders, 39 female engineers  from ASML’s Taiwan Applications team gathered in  Taichung in June to celebrate International Women in  Engineering Day. This dedicated annual event encourages  female engineers to learn, share and support each other in  the workplace. It also serves as an international awareness  campaign to raise the profile of women in engineering and  focus attention on career opportunities. In the US, we established an ASML US Diversity Council in  2020. This will serve as an advisory board and govern  diversity and inclusion (D&I) programs, such as employee  resource/affinity groups, diversity events, recognition and  education across the US. It will consist of a group of  leaders who act on behalf of ASML to develop and drive  our D&I programs. The council will help ensure strategic  accountability for results, provide governance and  oversight on diversity efforts, and support company-wide  communication on progress. Building on the experiences in US we will install a Global  D&I council. Like in the US, this council will consist of a  group of leaders who act on behalf of ASML to develop  and drive our D&I programs. The council will help ensure  strategic accountability for results, provide governance and  oversight on diversity efforts, and support company-wide  communication on progress. Although data shows we are improving, we are aware of  certain areas where we need to improve, such as the  percentage of female managers. Therefore, we will focus  on improving ASML' attractiveness for female talents, and  will set realistic objectives for improvement per sector. Also  next year we will use more data to see where we still need  to improve. and also use focus groups to learn more about  what is behind the numbers. We will also prepare a more detailed action plan to set  minorities up for success, through actions such as  sponsorship, mentoring and training on unconscious bias  or managing diverse teams. Fair remuneration We want our remuneration to be fair and balanced. In our  remuneration policy, we are committed to gender equality  and we strive for global consistency while respecting what  is common practice in local markets. We continuously  review how our remuneration compares to the market  benchmark for technology professionals in each region  where we operate and, where necessary, make changes to  our remuneration policies and levels. Each year, we analyze  paid salaries for gender disparity. In 2020, as in previous  years, we found no major differences in these salaries. See  Non-financial statements - Non-financial indicators for  details on gender payment. Living wage At ASML, we are committed to meeting adequate living- wage requirements, meaning that employees earn salaries  that meet their and their families' basic needs, but also  provides some discretionary income. Our company has a  predominantly highly educated workforce with relatively  high levels of remuneration. In 2020, we conducted an  analysis of how our lowest base salary compared to the  local minimum wage and local ‘living wage’ in the countries  and regions where we operate. We did not detect any  gaps. On average, our salaries are significantly above local  living wage. Labor relations We want to provide fair labor conditions and social  protection for all our employees, regardless of their location  and whether they are on a fixed or temporary contract. We support the principles of the International Labor  Organization (ILO) and we respect the rights of all  employees to form and join trade unions of their own  choosing, to bargain collectively and to engage in peaceful  assembly. We strive to comply with the relevant legislations in every  country we operate in. In those countries where we have  employee representation, we engage in regular dialogue  with the different organizations representing our  employees. In these conversations, topics are put forward  and discussed by both the company and the employee  representatives. We do not have operations in countries where the freedom  of association and collective bargaining for ASML  employees is restricted. In the Netherlands, we have requested dispensation from  the Metalektro Collective Labor Agreement (CLA) in order  to develop our own CLA. Our unique position in the global  market, our size and growth as well as our very unique  group of employees, the large range of competencies and  activities we bring together to deliver our products have  created a need for our own direction in labor conditions.  The purpose of a future ASML CLA is to offer a set of labor  conditions that match the diversity and needs of all our  employees. The new CLA will be developed in close collaboration with  the unions represented in the Metalektro. Once we have  our new CLA in place, we will continue to work with the  unions regarding labor conditions within the framework of  our own CLA and maintain our active membership in  various labor organizations, such as FME and PME. Ensuring employee safety At ASML, safety is not just a priority – it’s a core value. We  owe our employees and others working for us a safe  working environment. We do everything in our power  therefore to provide injury-free and healthy working  conditions for everyone on our premises and ensure all our  operations are safe and secure. This includes employees,  contractors, suppliers, customers, and visitors. We count  on each other – every one of us working at and for ASML –  to share this commitment. Our employee and product safety commitment is captured  in our Sustainability Policy, which applies to ASML  worldwide. In addition, our ASML Environment, Health and  Safety Guide aims to provide practical, useful and essential  Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) information for our  employees, contractors, and any other parties working for  us. The guide explains our aims and objectives, and clearly  describes the rules and policies we follow. It’s designed to  create awareness and ownership. We provide employees with EHS training to raise their  awareness, encourage responsible behavior and familiarize  them with EHS standards. For more information on product  safety see What we achieved in 2020 - Technology and  innovation ecosystem - Product safety. Our highest level of preparedness is represented by  ASML’s crisis management plan, which was crucial and  effective in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.  A  hotline with global coverage was established to provide  instant support for our employees. At site level, ASML has  documented emergency response procedures in place for  each ASML location. Ensuring health and safety is our first priority. Experiencing  COVID-19 like symptoms can be a cause for anxiety and  worry. Testing  is an important measure in controlling the  spread of the virus. The waiting times for regular tests via  the public health services (GGD) were long, and we  therefore sought a solution to help our employees. In the  Netherlands we offered voluntary COVID-19 tests to our  employees and their direct family members. These tests  were performed by an authorized external provider, using  test-sets that are high quality and compliant with all  applicable laws, regulations and guidelines. Privacy is  guaranteed during the performance of the tests organized  by ASML. The pandemic had no impact on EHS performance and  initiatives. Operations continued and internal EHS audits  were performed remotely. Our approach to employee safety We take responsibility for protecting our employees by  making ASML a safe place to work. EHS is crucial to  creating a safe and trusted working environment. We  believe that all work-related injuries and occupational  illnesses are preventable. As such, we are working towards  a long-term ambition of zero injuries and work-related  illnesses. Our target is to prevent occupational health and safety  incidents. To benchmark our performance against industry  standards, we use a targeted recordable injury rate of 0.25,  which represents world-class performance. But our  ongoing ambition is zero, and this drives our continuous  improvement in processes, working conditions and employee behavior. We use the highest possible  professional standards, and continuous improvement is a  key principle of our management system. We are committed to a well-established EHS management  system. Our EHS management system is based on the ISO  45001 and complies with these requirements. We ensure  continuous improvement through internal EHS audits. Incident management and risk management are key  elements of our EHS management system. This process  ensures we not only record incidents and injuries but also  cases where we have unsafe situations or near-misses.  These allow us to address high-risk situations before they  can turn into actual incidents, and cause injuries to our  employees. We investigate all incidents and near-misses to  determine the root cause and take corrective action to  prevent them from recurring or occurring in the future. It’s impossible to completely eradicate risk, but we can  work proactively at all levels to identify potential issues or  concerns in the workplace and develop measures towards  reducing these. We believe we need to do everything within  our reach to minimize risk, and that it is our responsibility to  provide our people with the right protection, procedures  and processes to keep them safe. Managing a safe workplace To ensure that we implement our EHS guidelines  effectively, we have a safety program in place. ASML’s  Board has appointed the Chief Operating Officer (COO) as  the lead for the EHS management system. We’ve also The dynamic nature of ASML’s business today –  continuous technology and product innovation, rapid  growth, many new colleagues and geographic expansion  – brings opportunity, but also potential safety risk.  Our lithography platforms, in particular, are becoming  bigger and more complex, with a growing number of  components presenting potential safety hazards that can  lead to severe or even fatal injuries. We introduced five safety rules to not only ensure  our employees are prepared for these hazards, but  also to create a safer workplace and enhance our  safety performance. Underpinning each safety rule is  a high-potential safety risk, meaning these rules have  the greatest potential to prevent serious injuries and  fatalities. Everyone should adhere to these rules knowing  that in the event of a threat or breach, the work must  stop with the full support of management. Verify isolation and lockout before beginning work Get authorization before entering a confined space 3. Take precautions while moving heavy loads 4. Protect yourself while working at height 5. Drive safely Respecting and adhering to these rules could not only  save lives, but also make us collectively more aware of  safety risks across our organization. The rules apply to  everyone, and we require everyone to know them, even  when they don’t directly apply in daily activities. established a Corporate EHS Committee to oversee and  approve ASML EHS strategy. Our line managers are  responsible for day-to-day EHS management. Our EHS  Competence Center gathers the best practices and defines  the EHS standards for ASML, helping our managers to  implement these standards at the workplace.   To improve our EHS performance, we encourage our  employees to speak up whenever they encounter safety  risks. Every employee is empowered to stop working if  they feel unsafe. Together with their manager and EHS  expert, a safe way of working will be defined, so the work  can resume. We conduct regular hazard and risk evaluations, with a  focus on preventing employees’ potential exposure to  hazards such as chemicals, fire, radiation, mechanical  handling, and ergonomic risks. These provide us with  further insights into the main hazard and risk areas at  ASML. We can then take appropriate action to mitigate  these risks. Implementing standardized EHS processes and systems  alone is not enough to prevent accidents when working  to deliver our customer commitments under stressful  conditions. We also need to increase our maturity in the  way we approach safety as a whole. We are well underway in our journey towards a stronger,  more proactive safety culture across ASML. We have  conducted a company-wide safety-culture survey to  measure our current position on the safety culture  maturity ladder across all sectors, and to benchmark  ourselves within our industry. The overall outcome of the survey provides us with  insights on how to reach the next level of maturity  towards an independent safety culture. We are deploying  initiatives and focus on creating awareness to accelerate  and embed the independent safety culture at ASML. How we did in 2020 At ASML, it is standard practice to inform our employees  and anyone else accessing our premises and customer  sites independently – including contractors and suppliers –  about our safety culture requirements and to raise  awareness around these. Training is one of the ways we  prepare and inform our people about this safety culture. In  2019, we updated our EHS Fundamentals training, tailoring  it to the needs of our people. The EHS training features  real-world situations. It is compulsory for everyone working  at ASML. We updated our EHS Fundamentals with training focused  on our five new life-saving rules. Introduced and rolled out  in 2020, we view these as a step forward towards an  independent safety culture. By December, 94.4% percent  of eligible candidates had completed this mandatory  training. Our recordable incident rate decreased to 0.18 in 2020  (0.28 in 2019), outperforming industry benchmark of 0.25.  The main reason for this decrease is the absence of office  related injuries due to the work at home policy in 2020. In  2020, we continued our efforts to reinforce our safety  culture program. As in previous years, we did not record  any work-related fatalities or permanent disabilities. We  register EHS-related incidents in line with the US  Occupational Health and Safety Act. ASML Taiwan won the 2020 Corporate Health  Responsibility (CHR) award, becoming the only company  from the semiconductor industry in Taiwan to ever win  this prestigious award. Presented by Commonwealth  Media Group, the award received more than 200 entries,  compared to 168 in 2019. Participation was open to a  broad range of industries in Taiwan – from insurance  to banking, car components and even aerospace  companies – and corporations were scored on criteria  including awareness, activities, aliment, assistance, and  epidemic-prevention measurement. Community engagement As a global technology leader and employer, we are also part of the communities where we operate. Being part of a  community means not only caring for our own employees but also looking out for those beyond our organization. We  foster close community ties and encourage our employees to get involved and do their part as well. ASML needs the  support of the community to be successful and will earn that support if ASML lets the community benefit from its  presence and is considerate of the community's needs. Our community engagement program, which falls under our CEO's area of responsibility, is built on three pillars where  ASML has competence and can create impact:  1. Culture  2. Local outreach 3. Education The total amount of cash commitments and in-kind support that ASML spent on charities, community engagement,  organizations, and our own ASML Foundation in 2020 was around €4.0 million. In addition, our social community support  during the pandemic amounted to €2.7 million. Culture Culture is the invisible bond that ties the people of a community together. To strengthen that bond, ASML  supports initiatives and organizations that are vital for the community’s culture and help open them up for  newcomers and the underprivileged. We focus on cultural icons in our communities: organizations and  initiatives with significant importance to society, and with an impact and reach that goes beyond the local  community. Supporting cultural  landmarks Netherlands In Nuenen, one of the towns in the Brainport Eindhoven region where the famous painter  Vincent Van Gogh created some of his breakthrough work in the late 1800s, we are  initiating the realization of 'Vincent's Lightlab' within the planned expansion of the Vincentre  Museum. Visitors will be able to learn more about light and how Van Gogh experimented  with it in his paintings. Netherlands We aim to significantly reduce the number of cars on our campus at Veldhoven. We  encourage our employees to use public transportation, and we also actively promote the  use of (e-)bikes for a healthy commute. Muziekgebouw Eindhoven: supporting the main concert hall in the Brainport Eindhoven  region and co-organizing events and programs that target diverse audiences. Every year,  ASML organizes a music festival, 'ASML on stage', for employees and their family and  friends. The festival covers all kind of music styles, from hard rock to classical music, from  folk to dance. Despite the fact that we had to postpone the tradition to 2021, we organized  an ASML on Stage 2020 virtual quiz event. Around 39 teams took part, from Asia, the US  and the Netherlands – roughly 600 streams! Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam: partnership to support the work of Van Gogh who was a  child of the southern Dutch province of Brabant where ASML is located. ASML contributes  research to safeguard Vincent’s work for the future. We are running education programs  together with the museum aimed at students and the underprivileged. Through the Brainport National Action Agenda, we support initiatives related to sports,  culture and education. We support an alternative edition of GLOW – Next Generation project – where school  children can follow workshops on how to 'make light' and how to communicate via Morse  code, using this light. We support local initiatives and organizations that are vital for our communities and that connect the  people in our communities. Together with ASML employees we contribute and make these initiatives  attractive and accessible and pay special attention to stimulate integration, promote diversity and  empower the underprivileged. Charity Netherlands ASML is a longstanding donor of the Voedselbank Eindhoven. In addition this year, we  donated 400 tickets for five matches of PSV's home games to the Voedselbanken and  Leger des Heils (the shelter organization). We also supported the Ronald McDonald House  in Veldhoven. Promote vitality Netherlands Partnership with Dutch first-division football club PSV Eindhoven (European champions  of 1988). Long-term commitment, together with other large companies in the Brainport  Eindhoven region, to support PSV - the community’s favorite and most successful sports  institution. This includes putting the spotlight on the region by marketing Brainport on  the team jersey (a world first in professional football). We also run an integrated program  with the other partners to promote vitality for all citizens in the community. ASML donates  tickets from our sponsorship allocation to families who are not able to afford to attend PSV  matches. Employee Volunteering  program Worldwide We encourage our employees to work one day per year as volunteers to lend a helping  hand. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, the number of volunteering hours decreased significantly  this year to 1,333 hours versus 7,500 last year. A good example of an alternative activity  that was done despite COVID-19, was an online hackathon to help develop a new website  for an NGO. Other activities included the collection of winter coats for people in need, and  of Christmas presents for children from financially disadvantaged families. US We donated $10,000 to Big Brothers Big Sisters of San Diego which creates a donor  and volunteer-supported mentoring network that makes meaningful, monitored matches  between adult volunteers and children, ages 7-18, in communities across the country. It  develops positive relationships that have a direct and lasting effect on the lives of young  people. Brainport partners and PSV established the Brainport Eindhoven Partner Fund, with the  aim of working together to find solutions to urgent societal problems in the region. This new  charity foundation will help to improve the lives of disadvantaged residents in the Brainport  area. The fund will unite parties in a joint approach to several urgent societal challenges,  such as poverty, vitality, unemployment, opportunities for children, and social cohesion. We donated $10,000 to Alpha Project, which serves over 4,000 men, women and children  in San Diego through activities such as affordable housing, residential substance abuse  treatment, supporting housing for people with special needs, basic and emergency  services for the homeless, transportation assistance, mental health counseling,  employment training, outreach and community services. Brainport Eindhoven & PSV jointly launched an online platform aimed at inspiring and  motivating everyone in the Brainport region in the area of health and well-being. We shared  our knowledge and expertise around seven well-being themes: setting goals, exercise,  nutrition, sleep, energy and time management, social environment and relaxation. The aim  is to create a vital and healthy region for all. Education ASML recognizes the need to prepare people of all ages for an increasingly digital future,  and specifically the importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and  Mathematics) competences to help all children reach their potential. We organize and  sponsor numerous initiatives that aim to share our enthusiasm for and expertise in  technology to inspire all generations. We partner with multiple organizations and  educational events that promote opportunities and potential of careers in technology. Our  employees act as role models and guides for these initiatives. The Education team works closely with schools and education programs in the communities where ASML has  operations. The Education team provides hands-on support and coordinates a network of ASML volunteers (our so- called ASML ambassadors) who visit schools and events, and support children and schools in their curricula, some as  part-time ('hybrid') teachers, some as tutors of disadvantaged children, and some as technology and STEM promoters.  Our intensive STEM education program aims to boost interest in technology among young people and increase the  local and regional talent pool. We also raise awareness of career prospects in a sector offering many development  opportunities. 2. The ASML Foundation is an independent foundation, but has strong ties to ASML. It operates at arm’s length and has  its own board and budget. It aims to increase the self-sufficiency of disadvantaged children around the world through  educational initiatives that develop their talent and help unlock their potential. For more, see section ASML Foundation. STEM education  program  Netherlands In the Eindhoven area, ASML participated in a mini edition of the Night of the Nerds online  event during Dutch Technology Week (DTW). An online offering for secondary school  students was set up to create awareness around technology and technology studies. Promote STEM  initiatives worldwide Netherlands To address the shortage of STEM teachers, we created the hybrid teaching program. We’re  not only growing our number of technology ambassadors but also enabling 100 engineers  in the Netherlands to become part-time or ‘hybrid’ teachers, paid by ASML. We plan to  expand it to the US and Asia.   We also partner with multiple educational events that promote opportunities and potential  of careers in technology, such as Dutch Technology Week (DTW) and FIRST.  As an example, we distributed 5,000 Blink Bug build your own bug kits to elementary  schools in the Brainport Eindhoven region to get kids connected to technology. Asia ASML is proud to sponsor the Taiwan Railways Fair of Popular Science. This national  project, held by the Ministry of Science and Technology, aims to inspire and engage more  than 9,000 primary school students from 23 cities in Taiwan. We cooperated with 80 SPIE/ OSA Student Chapters from six universities in Taiwan to host a unique Optical Sciences  train cabin. US ASML San Diego supported the EXPO Day where employees helped promote STEM  education at Petco Park during the San Diego Festival of Science & Engineering by  showing kids how to program robots. Asia In Shanghai, ASML supported the 2nd ASML Youth Maker and Hacker Science &  Technology Innovation. Some 80 school children from 15 elementary and secondary  schools took part in the contest. The contest was designed to promote science education  and inspire more students to choose STEM in their future education and careers. We joined hands with Yuan T. Lee Science Education to launch a three-year 'ASML Taiwan  Science Rooting Project'. The project consists of a three-year seed teacher-training  program planned for three schools, funded by the ASML Foundation. It is estimated that  more than 1,500 Taiwanese students will learn basic scientific knowledge through hands- on experience over the next three years. The ASML Foundation, which funds projects to improve the lives of young  people with inclusive, quality education, is our charity of choice. In 2020,  the Foundation donated around €1 million, supporting 22 projects in 11  countries. Although closely linked to our company, the ASML Foundation  operates independently. Over the last three years, we have reached over  17,000 children. Through funding and partnerships, the ASML Foundation aims to help disadvantaged children become more self- sufficient by supporting educational initiatives that develop their talent and unlock their potential. We promote the  sustainable development of less-privileged children around the world by supporting inclusive and quality education for all  and promoting lifelong learning. By doing this, we aim to make a sustainable impact on SGD 4 Quality Education, and  contribute to SDG 5 (Gender Equality) and SDG 10 (Reduce Inequalities). We want to make a difference in the community in the locations where we operate. As such, we mainly support projects  and initiatives in ASML countries in Asia, Europe and the US. These projects address the specific needs in that region. In  the US, for example, projects focus mainly on preventing school dropouts in less-privileged areas, and on promoting  STEM, especially for girls. Projects in Asia differ per country. In developing areas in Asia, for example, there is a focus on  education for girls to reduce inequality and also to prevent child marriages. In China, the focus is on STEM for girls in rural  areas. In Europe and in the Netherlands, the foundation focuses on education for disadvantaged children, and children  lacking in education, providing help that suits their specific needs. Tackling illiteracy in the Brainport region also became a  key focus area for the ASML Foundation in 2020. ASML employees support the ASML Foundation financially when they purchase goods from the ASML employee store  and through donations. ASML Foundation is also responsible for ASML’s volunteering program: it coordinates the  volunteering activities and  keeps track of the volunteering hours that ASML employees contribute to education initiatives  and other causes. ASML employees are allowed to take eight hours per year to do volunteer work; many volunteers also  donate their own time. In 2020, we maintained our focus on education, as well as helping and financially supported our current partners needing  to, for example, convert education efforts from physical classes to virtual learning. STEM - Girls Can Do It  (China) The STEM - Girls Can Do It project focuses on young people – especially girls – in rural China, near ASML’s  offices in Chengdu and Xi’an. It aims to promote more gender-balanced STEM education. The project  will expose about 1,200 young people, of which 70% are girls, to STEM, and teach them coding and  programming. Employees from the local ASML offices have been actively involved in the partnership as  volunteers, hosting, for example, in-person events at ASML’s offices, and involving female engineers as  role models. We are planning to continue this volunteer partnership through an online program to enable  interaction with the girls. Friendship Bangladesh  (Bangladesh) Friendship Bangladesh provides access to healthcare, education and other necessities to people –  especially children – in the country's remote northern island region. As there are few to no qualified teachers  available, the Friendship Secondary Education Program, supported by the ASML Foundation, provides  education to children in these remote communities through ICT. Thousands of hours of educational videos  were made by highly qualified teachers living in Dhaka. The program also serves a secondary purpose: it  gives girls from underserved communities an alternative to early marriage by enabling them to continue  their education. The Foundation has supported Friendship Bangladesh since 2015 and funded their digital  education pilot. It has been so successful that during the lockdown period, the Bangladeshi government  reached out to Friendship Bangladesh for help and insight into best practices for online learning. In this way,  Friendship Bangladesh was able to expand its scope to state schools, YouTube, and television. Trudo Weekend School   (Netherlands) In the Netherlands, the ASML Foundation has adopted a class of students for three years through Trudo  Weekend school, located in the Brainport region. Trudo Weekend school is a ‘school’ for children, aged  10-14, from lower socioeconomic neighborhoods in Eindhoven who are motivated to invest in themselves.  The school offers these children the opportunity to reach their potential by attending classes every Sunday  for three years. The program covers science, society, culture and art education, as well as interpersonal and  social skills. We also provided the children in their final year with laptops, needed when starting secondary  schooling. Girls Inc. of the PNW- Portland, OR  (US) In Portland, Oregon, near our offices in Hillsboro, we are supporting the girls-empowerment NGO Portland  Girls Inc. We fund a five-year program that supports girls from disadvantaged backgrounds and focuses  on instilling an interest in STEM. In addition, we are making progress in launching a volunteering program  involving ASML employees, including female engineers, who will give of their time as role models and  mentors. The ASML Foundation is currently supporting 125 girls for a five-year period. For more information, visit www.asmlfoundation.org The COVID-19 pandemic affected every age group, and every aspect of the lives and the world we live in -  health, education, work, and so on. It is our duty to reach out and help our communities, and we're  committed to supporting them during the pandemic. ASML also supports the coordinated actions of the  national and regional authorities, as well as the efforts of other local organizations. Engineering support  Netherlands May 2020 - We made a €100,000 donation into a small start-up relief fund, in partnership  with Brainport partners and the province. The Bright Move fund provides financial support. Social support Netherlands April 2020 - We donated 400 tablets to nursing homes in the Brainport Eindhoven region.  We also donated ‘hero hospital gowns’ to the children's wards of four hospitals, in  collaboration with PSV and Brainport Eindhoven. Education support Netherlands March 2020 - We provided 500 laptops to help ensure that students in the Brainport  Eindhoven region could continue their schooling online. TechMeUp  (Netherlands) Together with many technology education providers, we decided to support TechMeUp. Its purpose is  to make education accessible to everyone. The organization aims to invest in people's opportunities by  providing interest-free loans to support those who would like or need to retrain for a job in technology, but  don’t have the means to do so. These loans need to be repaid in monthly installments once the student has  found a job. Medical supplies  Netherlands April 2020 - We used our network to ensure the shipment of more than 300,000 face masks  to hospitals and other care institutions. Together with our logistic partners, we helped with  the shipment of two face-mask production machines to a Dutch supplier to boost face- mask production. Asia November - December 2020 - ASML Singapore donated over €900,000 to the following  five Singaporean charities: Children’s Aid Society; SPD (door-to-door transport services  for the disabled); AMKFSC Community Services; Food from the heart; Metta Welfare  Association. US March - June 2020 - In San Diego, employees and family/friends took part in a bike tour  and raised $5,000 for Multiple Sclerosis research and funding. In the spring of 2020, the  Silicon Valley and Wilton teams organized virtual food drives for local food banks during the  pandemic. Between the two drives, they donated a total of $39,000 to help families in need.  We have donated €5,000 to Food bank San Diego. Asia May 2020 - Since 2017, ASML Korea employees have hosted several science events for  children from disadvantages backgrounds. This year, the Science Camp Korea program  went online so the science camps could continue. Asia April 2020 - We donated 200 care packages to medical frontline workers. US April 2020 - We donated $250,000 worth of critical personal protective equipment to  several Connecticut hospitals. To help with humanitarian activities in California, we donated  300 face masks to first responders of the California Army National Guard. Our people KPIs  The table below shows the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the related 2025 targets. In 2019, we adopted a new  sustainability strategy - as a result no comparative results for 2018 are available for new performance indicators. See Non- financial statements - Non-financial indicators for our performance indicators (PIs) and related results. Contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals Our ambitions, commitments and programs as described in this chapter contribute to the following SDGs. For more  information on the performance, see section Non-financial statements - Non-financial indicators. In 2019, we redesigned our employee engagement survey (previously me@ASML) and changed the frequency from every 18 months to annual. 2. Employer brand ranking from Universum: engineering students.

Our supply chain At ASML, we rely heavily on our supplier network to  achieve the innovations we strive for. Our goal is to ensure  we get the products, materials and services we need to  meet our short- and long-term needs. This supports our  operations from the earliest moment of development to the  end-of-life stages of our systems. ASML invests considerable resources to develop and  introduce new systems and system enhancements, such  as EUV lithography, e-beam metrology and holistic  lithography. As these are complex technologies, ASML  focuses on a high value-added integration role to maximize  the total system competence and shorten cycle times. To  enable this focus on system-integration, ASML relies on an  extensive supply base of around 780 Product Related (PR)  suppliers and around 3,970 Non-Product Related (NPR)  suppliers. Long-term relations, close cooperation and  transparency with suppliers and partners are key to  success. Our supply landscape With around 4,750 suppliers in our total supplier base, we  distinguish between product-related and non-product  related suppliers. Product-related suppliers provide  materials, equipment, parts and tools used directly to  produce our systems. This category comprises 780  suppliers and represents the highest percentage of our  procurement volume, accounting for 68% of our total  spend. From this total number of product-related suppliers,  188 suppliers are critical suppliers, accountable for 95% of  the product-related spend. Non product-related suppliers are goods and services  suppliers, providing products and services supporting our  operations, varying from temporary labor to logistics and  from cafeteria services to IT services. With around 3,970  suppliers, this group represents nearly 85% of our total  supplier base in terms of the number of suppliers. We invest in developing our supply landscape to help  suppliers meet our requirements with regard to quality,  logistics, technology, cost and sustainability. Our supply €7.6bn Sourcing and supply chain strategy ASML's continued growth, in combination with our  ambitions, requires us to significantly improve our key  business processes. To help achieve our strategic  objectives, we decided to combine the activities of  Strategic Sourcing & Procurement and Supply Chain  Management into a single new sector, called Sourcing and  Supply Chain (S&SC). This took effect on May 1, 2020. Jan  Keller, a member of the ASML's Executive Committee and  of the Operations Management Team, was appointed  Executive Vice-President to lead this new sector. The aim  of this new organization is to deliver the best possible  supply chain for ASML, to have one ASML voice for our  chain strategy includes six priorities regarding the  capabilities of our suppliers and how we work with them:  we enable the product roadmap through the development  and maintenance of best-in-class competencies and  capabilities; efficient and dedicated operations that enable  cost-per-wafer economics for our customers, having  resilient suppliers able to adjust to volatile market cycles;  close cooperation to secure early supplier involvement in  the new product introduction process; a commitment to  quality and expectation that our suppliers will proactively  invest in and maintain a state-of the-art quality  management system, and active contribution to our  sustainability strategy. ASML acquisition of Berliner Glas Group On October 30, 2020, ASML acquired all shares of Berliner  Glas Group, a key supplier to ASML for many years.  Berliner Glas Group is one of the world’s leading providers  of optical key components, assemblies and systems, high- quality refined technical glass as well as glass touch  assemblies. Berliner Glas Group is headquartered in Berlin  and has facilities at five locations throughout Germany,  Switzerland and China. With the acquisition of Berliner Glas  Group, we acquired technical capabilities that are critical to  secure the future roadmap for our EUV and DUV products  and will provide increased value to ASML's customers  through strengthened collaboration and bundling our  competences to accelerate our innovation. At the start of the COVID-19 crisis, we rapidly established  crisis management protocols. We created a global cross- sector team tasked with securing continuity of supply. We  set up daily communication to inform our suppliers on  ASML's COVID-19 restrictions and requirements. The team  aimed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on suppliers by  identifying and implementing solutions to secure supply to  global ASML factories and field warehouses. The team  reviewed, on a daily basis, supply shortages or pending  restrictions that would affect our supply. We implemented  solutions in close collaboration with our suppliers where  required.  Through the dedication of our suppliers and our  people, we experienced only temporary shortages, and  these were resolved before they could impact our 2020  output. In 2019, we indicated that we would expand our Re-use  program. In 2020, we introduced a dedicated cross-sector suppliers, and united representation within ASML to secure  preconditions for suppliers' quality, logistics, technology,  cost and sustainability (QLTCS) performance. Continuously improving our suppliers’ performance and  capabilities is at the heart of our sourcing strategy. We have  a framework to communicate process requirements and  compliance expectations to suppliers. One example is our  supplier-profiling methodology, consisting of a supplier  performance dashboard, a supplier capability self- assessment and a risk profile. The framework outlines our  approach to supplier management and development  towards the desired ASML supplier landscape. This  provides an enhanced knowledge base to improve our  dialogue with suppliers around their performance and  development potential. ASML always strives to select the best supplier that meets  our requirements on all five capability dimensions. We  monitor supplier performance in terms of quality, logistics,  technology, cost and sustainability. When performance  drops below annually set thresholds and does not recover  upon request and within a reasonable time frame, ASML  will take action to secure reliable future supplies. When one of our critical EUV suppliers had to lock  down their entire facility following California’s Shelter at  Home order (in March 2020), it threatened to severely  impact our supply chain. To reopen, our supplier, which  produces many of the essential assemblies for the  NXE top module, needed to establish that they are an  essential business supporting a critical infrastructure  industry and put in place all adequate measures to  secure a safe environment to their employees. They  managed to do this in only a few days, thanks to the  ASML Sourcing and Legal teams, which quickly gathered  the appropriate information. With the facility now working again, our Supply Chain  Management team continues to closely monitor the  supply versus demand picture, expediting materials  where necessary so they do not constrain output. This  approach requires close daily cross-sector management  to avoid disruptions. Our risk-management approach  We rely on our suppliers to develop, manufacture and  deliver the innovative and unique parts used in our  lithography systems. Due to the highly specialized nature  of many of our parts and modules, as well as limited set  size, it is not always economical to source from more than  one supplier. Our sourcing strategy therefore (in many  cases) prescribes 'single sourcing, dual competence'. Our  reliance on single sourcing requires us to proactively  manage supplier performance and risk. To that end, Sourcing conducts continuous performance  and risk management of the supply base with the purpose  to: i) Assure and improve performance, ii) Secure continuity  of supply, iii) Protect our intellectual property and maintain  a leading technology position, and iv) Prevent reputational  damage. Five risk domains are assessed (Calamity,  Ownership, Financial, IP & Information Security, and  Compliance). In cases where risk exceeds the agreed  threshold, mitigation measures are taken. As suppliers operating in the same industry or market are  typically exposed to similar risk, we evaluate suppliers’ risk  and performance within the context of their supply market  category. We will adjust our category strategies where  required to meet ASML's short and long-term business  needs. In 2020, we continued to focus on improving business- recovery capabilities through the review of business- continuity plans focusing on increasing the quality of  preventive measures and improving financial transparency  through more frequent assessment of financial health for  the most critical suppliers. In addition, we continued to  expand our information security and cyber-resilience  program with suppliers. To improve business-recovery capabilities, we require  suppliers to have business-recovery capabilities in line with  the ISO 22301 standard. Supplier-recovery plans are  requested, evaluated and, where needed, improved to  prevent potential business disruptions. In 2020, we  included 188 business critical product-related suppliers in  our business-continuity program, and extended the scope  with 34 non-product related suppliers. Suppliers with access to top secret information or with  privileged access to our IT systems are asked to improve  information security through the ISO 27001 standard. In  2020, we included 143 suppliers in our information security  program. ASML uses the ISO 27001 framework to support  suppliers in a standardized way in their efforts to raise  cyber resilience. Going forward, the maturity of our  ecosystem will be further reinforced by establishing a  'circle of trust', a network of suppliers that jointly embrace  the information security standards and raise their  performance against these standards. Re-use department, representing Factory, Customer  Support, S&SC, D&E, Program and Finance. This  department is hosted by Sourcing & Supply Chain. The Re- use team will establish an end-to-end process that  supports the increase of parts, tools and packaging re-use,  set-up of local and global repair centers, and improve the  learning loop. Re-use strongly contributes to a circular  economy and the reduction of operating costs. For more  information, see Circular economy - Accelerating re-use of  parts, tools and packaging and materials. Other examples of successful risk mitigations are: getting long-term supplier agreements (LTSAs) and/or continuous  supply agreements in place, ensuring the availability of IP in escrow, requiring suppliers to put their inventory in separate  locations, requiring suppliers to implement fire prevention controls, and increasing buffer stock. For a further description of  our risk management, see How we manage risk. Responsible supply chain At ASML, we are committed to conducting our business in a caring and accountable manner, and being recognized as a  responsible business partner. RBA Code of Conduct commitment Since 2011, we have been a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the world’s largest industry coalition  dedicated to corporate social responsibility in global electronics supply chains. We have adopted the RBA Code of  Conduct (Code), which is a  standard to ensure that working conditions in the electronics industry or industries in which  electronics is a key component and its supply chains are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that  business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. We promote the principles contained in the RBA Code to our suppliers and subcontractors, and expect key suppliers to  participate in this common effort, by acknowledging and adopting the RBA Code. We screen our supplier base on  sustainability performance using this standard from the RBA. It is our policy to discuss all high-risk findings with the supplier in scope. In 2020, the RBA SAQ indicated a high risk on the  elements labor and ethics for one supplier. We evaluate all RBA SAQs, and based on this evaluation and engagement with  the supplier, we determined that the risk did not relate to actual breach or incident and no improvement plan was needed. Labor To uphold the human rights of all workers (direct and  indirect), and to treat them with dignity and respect as  understood by the international community, including the  International Labor Organization's (ILO) eight fundamental  conventions. Health and Safety To minimizing the incidence of work-related injury  and illness and to ensure a safe and healthy working  environment. Communication and education is essential  to identifying and solving health and safety issues in the  workplace. Environment Environmental responsibility is integral to producing  world-class products and services. Adverse effects on the  community, environment and natural resources are to be  minimized while safeguarding the health and safety of the  public. Ethics To meet social responsibilities and to achieve success in  the industry, the highest standards of ethics should be  upheld, including but not limited to business integrity,  anti-bribery and corruption, antitrust and competition,  protecting privacy. Members and participants are committed to establishing a management system to ensure:  • compliance with applicable laws, regulations and customer requirement;  • conformance with the Code standards;  • identification and mitigation of operational risks; and  • facilitate continual improvement. Our annual Suppliers’ Day helps us foster strong relationships with suppliers. To ensure we could continue to do so even with  COVID-19 restrictions, we organized a hybrid event, which featured a virtual event attended by over 250 supplier representatives  and a live event with 16 strategic suppliers.  The event was an opportunity for our suppliers to familiarize themselves with our strategy and targets through senior leadership  presentations. The live and virtual Q&A session allowed suppliers to pose questions to senior management, including our Chief  Strategy Officer and Chief Technology Officer. During the cyber resilience satellite session, a total of 30 CIOs and IT directors of our suppliers discussed the increased focus  on cyber resilience, which has become a top priority for companies. The event closed with an awards presentation to recognize  several suppliers for their work with ASML, including two awards for valuable contributions to ASML’s circular-economy ambitions. To underpin our commitment to a sustainable and resilient  supplier network, we expect our key suppliers and their  suppliers to comply with the RBA Code of Conduct as well.  This requirement is included in our long-term product- related suppliers’ contracts. We encourage our suppliers to  develop their own sustainability strategies, policies and  processes, and actively pursue our suppliers’ adherence to  this code. Sustainability risk approach We assess compliance with the RBA Code of Conduct  through a risk-based approach. We scan all new suppliers  for potential high risks and work with them during the  onboarding process to remedy any issues we identify. We  expect our strategic and high-risk suppliers to complete  the RBA Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) each year  to validate their compliance with the RBA Code of Conduct  and to determine a supplier’s potential gaps in relation to  the standards set forth in the RBA Code of Conduct. In general, the RBA SAQ results show a relatively low risk  level in our supply base, as most of our suppliers operate  in countries with a strong rule of law and are law abiding. Managing high-risk suppliers A key performance indicator of our approach to ensuring a  sustainable supply chain is the percentage of suppliers in  scope who complete the RBA SAQ. In 2020, we expanded  the scope of our RBA assessment to include non-product  related suppliers and high-risk regions covering 80% of our  total supply base spend. In 2020, 88% of the major  suppliers in scope completed this questionnaire. Our target  is to achieve a 90% completion rate by 2025, which puts  us well ahead of our ambitions. If a supplier does not  conform to our required standards, our policy is to discuss  mitigating measures. Our second key performance Applied to business-critical  suppliers of strategic  importance  €7.6bn total spend 4,749 suppliers indicator is to have 100% improvement plans in place for  high-risk suppliers, as identified by the RBA self- assessment. We also conduct supplier audits to address risks we  identify in our regular risk assessments. These audits  intend to verify supplier self-assessment and completion of  improvement plans. However, in 2020 we did not conduct  on-site supplier audits on sustainability criteria due to travel  limitations and the focus on securing continuity of our  supply chain as a result of the global impact of the  pandemic. Assessing human-rights risks Our robust risk-based assessment and audit process for  suppliers covers human rights issues. In our due diligence  process, we use the RBA Risk Assessment Platform to  identify inherent risks in labor (including human rights),  ethics, health & safety and environmental standards across  our full supply base. In the event of a medium or high risk  relating to labor being identified, we engage with the  supplier and conduct a more detailed analysis. For major  product-related and non-product related suppliers covering  80% of our spend, we expect them to complete the annual  RBA SAQ. This SAQ covers more than 400 risk elements  related to labor (including human rights), ethics,  environmental and safety factors, control elements and  management systems, including their performance. It helps  us to determine a supplier’s risk profile on sustainability.  When we identify compliance gaps, we engage with the  supplier to determine corrective action plan(s). In the 2020 RBA SAQ program, we identified one supplier  with high risk on labor. This related to management  systems rather than actual breaches of human rights. Circular procurement As part of ASML’s commitment to enhancing sustainability,  we want to play our part in realizing a circular economy  model. We do this by reusing parts, increasing energy  efficiency in our processes, and reducing scrap where  possible. We see this as a responsibility to be shared  between ourselves and our customers and suppliers. Our procurement team plays an important role in  implementing circular economy principles by promoting  circular procurement at all times. We aim to raise  awareness of circularity among our procurement  managers, so they incorporate re-use and recycling in their  way of thinking and procurement practices. Our ambition for 2025 is to increase our circular- procurement practice. In 2020, we started a process of  defining key performance indicators to measure progress  in our circular procurement. The cross-sector Re-use  program in ASML aims to re-use parts and materials  valued around €75 million. A key development is the setup  of new circular processes and contracting with the majority  of our first-tier supply base and align incentives for  maximizing re-use value. Our focus for 2021 and beyond is  to further expand our circular-procurement efforts. For  more information about our approach to the circular  economy policy and programs, see What we achieved in  2020 - Circular economy. Conflict minerals Like many companies in the electronics industry, our  products contain minerals and metals essential to the  manufacturing process. Examples of these are tantalum,  tungsten, tin and gold (3TG), so-called conflict minerals.  Although we do not use a significant amount of these  minerals, we need certain 3TG minerals to make our  products, and for them to function. Gold, for example, is  used in coating critical electronic connectors, and tin is  used for welding electronic components and creating EUV  light. At ASML, we are committed to a conflict-free minerals  policy regarding the responsible sourcing of materials in  our supply chain. We support international efforts to ensure  the mining and trading of 3TG minerals from high-risk  locations does not contribute to conditions of armed  conflict and/or serious human-rights abuses in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or its neighboring  countries. We have adopted a series of compliance  measures based on industry best practices. These include: • ASML has established a due diligence process and  closely monitors the use of conflict minerals in our  supply chain. • Our processes are based on the due diligence  framework set by the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD).  • We are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance  (RBA).  As such, we support initiatives which foster  better working conditions and raw material production. • We support the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI),  including the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process  (RMAP) and Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). • Annually, we ask our suppliers in scope to complete  a Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT). This  allows us to validate compliance with our conflict-free  minerals sourcing policy. • The requirement for suppliers to comply with our policy  is included in our supplier Code of Conduct and supplier  handbook. • We require our suppliers and sub-suppliers to have  relevant policies in place, and take due diligence  measures enabling us to investigate if products and  components supplied to us contain conflict minerals. We comply with Section 1502 of the US Dodd-Frank Act  and its application rules from the US Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC). We are committed to  publicly disclosing information related to the use of these  minerals in our products. For more information, see www. asml.com for our Conflict Minerals Statement and Conflict  Minerals Report. As we rely on our suppliers to develop, manufacture and  deliver the unique parts and modules used in our  lithography systems, the sourcing of these minerals goes  beyond our Tier 1 suppliers. There are several tiers of  suppliers between ASML and any smelter or refines of  conflict minerals, and even more when tracing a mineral all  the way back to the mines. This means that we do not  have a direct purchasing relationship with mines, smelters  or refiners. Despite continuous efforts, we are unable to determine the  precise origin of the 3TG minerals included in our products.  This is due to several reasons: 3TG supply-chain  complexity, the number of tiers of suppliers to trace the  source, and the limited number of certified conflict-free  smelters for all conflict minerals. To obtain correct data  from our supply chain is a challenge, but we continue our  efforts in this regard. In 2020, we started a project to  refresh our responsible minerals sourcing policy and due  diligence processes. Although we are not subject to these  particular directives, we aim to incorporate EU regulations  concerning supply chain due-diligence obligations  regarding 3TG minerals. Our supply chain KPIs The table below shows the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the related 2025 targets. In 2019, we adopted a new  sustainability strategy – as a result no comparative results for 2018 are available for new performance indicators. See Non- financial statements - Non-financial indicators for our performance indicators (PIs) and related results. This indicator shows the percentage of major suppliers in scope that completed the annual RBA self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ). 2. One supplier was identified with a high risk on sustainability elements. Based on the evaluation of the risk no improvement plan is necessary. Contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals Our ambitions, commitments and programs as described in this chapter contribute to the following SDGs. For more  information on the performance, see section Non-financial statements - Non-financial indicators. SDG target 8.8 - Protect labor rights and promote safe and secure working  environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women  migrants, and those in precarious employment SDG target 12.2 - By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient  use of natural resources  • Promote circular procurement Minimizing waste, maximizing resources to extract the maximum  value from the materials we use and repurpose our products  across their life cycles. Circular economy As we move away from the linear ‘take, make, dispose’  model, we believe the circular economy is key to  ensuring the future success and competitiveness of the  semiconductor equipment industry. We are committed to minimizing waste and maximizing the  use of resources, and believe that by doing so we not only  limit our environmental impact but also generate business  value. The modular design of our products lets us extract  the most value we can from the materials we use, and  repurpose our products across their life cycles. While continuously innovating, we also want to ensure the  increasingly sustainable use of materials across our  processes and value chain to reduce our environmental  footprint. Our commitment We are committed to circularity in our operations and our  products. We do this by responsibly managing waste  throughout our operations and maximizing the lifetime of  materials in our systems, so extending their lifespans. this end, we also work closely with our value chain.  Transforming our economy to a circular model and  promoting a conducive mindset is the joint responsibility of  ASML, our customers and suppliers. Given the modular designs of our products, we ensure that  those in use at our customers’ sites can be upgraded to a  higher performance level without having to replace the  entire product. After use in the most advanced chip- making factories, we further extend the lifetime of our  products by refurbishing systems and repurposing them for  other customers and semiconductor environments. Our initiatives in the service and upgrading of parts ensure  that modules can be restored to and qualified as ‘as-new’  for re-use within our systems. This re-use practice is  becoming increasingly important in our efforts to transition  to a circular business model. In 2020, we set up a specific  cross-sectoral Re-use department with full ownership of  this objective to broaden and accelerate initiatives to re- use parts, tools, modules and packaging while reducing  our total operational cost. We are committed to reducing, reusing and recycling our  waste as much as possible, rather than sending it on to an  incineration plant or landfill. Based on Lansink’s Ladder  Waste hierarchy, we manage our waste through proper  classification, separation and safe disposal. For more  information on our re-use of parts and materials, read  in What we achieved in 2020 - Circular economy -  Accelerating re-use of parts, tools and packaging and  materials. Reducing our environmental footprint is a shared  responsibility between our operations and supply chain. To  this end, we are raising awareness of our circular economy  principles with our procurement managers and engaging  with suppliers. Reduce waste Reducing our environmental footprint and managing our  waste – both from our operations and products – is key to  ASML’s circular economy approach and our sustainability  practices. There are several waste sources within our  operations: these include office, packaging, and hazardous  waste from the chemicals we use in our processes.  Another source is product waste from parts resulting from  upgrades or defective spare parts. We highlight the environmental impact of waste in our  sustainability strategy for the period 2019-2025. Our target  is to reduce our ‘waste intensity’ – the amount of measured  waste in kg per € million revenue – by 50% compared to  baseline year 2019, and increase material recycling to 85%  by 2025. These targets include hazardous and non- hazardous waste.   To achieve these targets, we are focusing on reusing parts  and components in our systems, packaging and tools,  non-product related waste such as IT hardware, office  materials, canteen waste and construction waste from our  real estate portfolio. We will also continue to carefully  monitor the hazardous waste we generate in our  manufacturing processes. Waste-management challenges Managing waste from our operations is a complex issue  and relies on having detailed and accurate insight into  waste streams to and from ASML. While we’ve developed  procedures to monitor and measure waste that leaves our  premises, including packaging materials and organic waste  from our cafeterias, it’s much harder to gain insight on the  waste streams of our customers. Our focus in 2020 was to gain better insight into all relevant  waste streams, including assessing what happens with our  waste at customer sites. We also conducted a feasibility  study into whether it makes sense to send used packaging  back to our manufacturing sites for re-use, comparing the  carbon footprint of transporting this used packaging  against the environmental gain of re-using it. The study  showed that the weight of the packaging is the most  relevant environmental aspect during transportation. These  assessments led to a lifecycle assessment model for  calculating the impact of waste and waste-reduction  activities that we will start applying in 2021. We use the European Union’s waste-classification system  to determine what constitutes waste. The COVID-19  pandemic led to waste reduction in our cafeteria as more  people were working from home. This waste category  represents just a small percentage of our overall waste  production, however, so the decrease did not significantly  change our overall waste generation. Hazardous waste We use hazardous substances to produce and operate our  products and systems. This makes us subject to a variety  of governmental regulations relating to environmental  protection (as well as employee and product health and  safety), including the transport, use, storage, discharge,  handling, emission, generation, and disposal of hazardous  substances. With an eye towards a more sustainable future, the department will increase our re-use efforts through their dedicated  groups for re-use in D&E, Sourcing & Supply Chain, Customer Support and the Factories, and dedicated repair centers in  Manufacturing and Customer Support. These will focus on extending local repair centers for service parts, tools and  materials, and set up global repair centers to repair field and factory materials and to function as repair competence  centers. Designing for re-use in the product design phase is also a key component of preventing waste and helps  us  meet our long-term goals. It is not only about making sure that the sectors learn how to re-use and prevent scrap, but also about teaching them how  to adopt re-use into their normal ways of working. The department’s end-goal is to ensure re-use is a default activity  across everything that we do. Our dedicated cross-sector leadership will report into sector heads, who in turn will report to  a newly set up Re-use Board, chaired by our Chief Operations Officer and our Chief Technology Officer. cleaning wipes and filters. Liquids, including acetone and sulfuric acid, are among the most important of our waste  streams. Most of these materials are recovered through recycling. In 2020, we completed the first phase of an  investigation into solutions for sulfuric acid re-use. Based on this investigation, we’ve designed and built an installation for  pilot testing. We will conduct the second phase of the investigation and testing in 2021. We are committed to reducing our hazardous waste, aiming to draw as much as possible from materials, and using no  more than we need. The scope of our 2025 target to cut our waste intensity by 50% includes both hazardous and non- hazardous waste. Waste-management initiatives To achieve our target of cutting our waste per revenue by 50% by 2025, we plan to launch new initiatives in 2021. In 2020,  we achieved waste reduction through several ongoing programs as listed in the table below. One of these programs  consisted of a series of local waste-reduction initiatives, initiated by our employees, including plastic recycling, working  with re-usable gloves in cleanrooms, and reducing the number of single-use coffee cups. Accelerating re-use of parts, tools and packaging and materials We are committed to re-using parts, tools and packaging whenever possible in our value chain to reduce and prevent  waste, reduce costs, and accelerate learning. Working together with our customers and suppliers, we aim to  remanufacture used system parts, re-using as if they were new parts and preventing unnecessary waste. We strongly accelerated our efforts in 2020, working towards formalizing and structuring this process, with the long-term  ambition of having the circular use of parts fully embedded in our business by 2025. We extended the re-use policy to all  parts and tools, and created a dedicated cross-sector Re-use department to drive material re-use on a global scale. We  apply re-use to all product-related parts and materials that come back from the field, from well-functioning used parts, to  defective parts and unused parts. We include parts that we can repair, harvest, upgrade, downgrade, and parts that are  reusable as 'As-New' parts after qualification. Programs Examples Local waste-reduction  programs • Reduce single-use coffee cups • Plastic recycling • Reusable cleanroom gloves Circular IT Lifecycle • After four years of use, all functioning computers and laptops are given a second life. Around 6,500  laptops, representing 64,000 kg materials, were re-used in 2020. • Defective computers are recycled in clean, separated  streams of recycled plastic, iron, steel, copper,  aluminum, glass, and precious metals. We recycled nearly 24,000 kg materials in 2020. Real-estate portfolio  management • BREEAM score ‘Excellent’ for Campus 2.0 • Recycling construction waste Return4Re-use • Re-use parts and transportation packaging. This program led to nearly 4,000,000 kg of materials re-used  in 2020.  • The Reclaim program at our facility in the US focuses on re-using a constant flow of returned parts. This  program includes design for reclaim, improving the ability to re-use and recondition the assemblies to  enable further increase of circularity of parts and materials, so it can either be re-used for spare parts  or incorporated into new system builds. This program has been successfully running for more than a  decade. Flexible cleanrooms • Our new ‘flex’ cleanrooms can move between locations and be assembled quickly, while providing  the same standards and performance as our current fixed cleanrooms. More than 95% of materials  in the flex cleanroom system are re-usable, and has a lifespan of >30 years. In 2020 we used the flex  cleanroom two times. Creating a learning organization Learning is also an important aspect of our Re-use  department: by designing for re-use, and improving  processes, we aim to close the learning loop and ultimately  prevent waste in the future. To achieve this, we need to leverage our organization to  start working on re-use everywhere, in both big and small  ways. For example, by replacing scrap beds in our  factories with what we now call ‘re-use collection corners’,  we encourage employees to think of used parts as having  potential rather than being seen as waste. Our re-use ambitions require a change of mindset.  Communication is key to this, through a top-down and  bottom-up approach. Setting the right example, talking to  teams, attending all-hands meetings, leveraging our Re- use representatives across the sectors, and providing  support where necessary. Senior management also play a  crucial role in getting the message across, both to their  internal colleagues and to our suppliers. Customer Support triage process  In 2020, we added an important step – a Customer  Support triage process – to the steps we follow when  handling used parts. We piloted this in the field in South  Korea and in our factories in Veldhoven, and plan to roll this  out in 2021. This triage involves a new process to deal with a part that  is not working, either because it’s worn out or defective. In  the past, our teams would evaluate what was wrong with  the part, note the results down through material  notifications, and, where appropriate, send it back to the  relevant suppliers. The new focus is on processing the defective parts and  thinking more critically about their potential. For parts that  are not scrap, this means thinking about what we can do  with them, either repairing them locally or sending them to  the next level of triage. Repair centers We are increasing ASML’s re-use efforts by extending local  repair centers for service parts and materials, and setting  up global repair centers for factory materials. We currently have local repair centers in South Korea and  Taiwan and will be rolling out to China in 2021. Our  ambition is to increase the re-use rate of our parts to 85%  by 2025. One of the ways to achieve this is by establishing more  local repair centers, with each region getting its own. There  are several benefits to enabling ‘simple’ repair and re-use  activities in the field, including reduced logistics time,  prevention of stocking of parts, and reduction of our  environmental impact. We will also be setting up global  repair centers in each factory hub in Wilton, San Diego,  Linkou, and Veldhoven. Maintaining As-New quality We set high quality standards on As-New parts and expect  suppliers to be involved to meet these standards. This  qualification standard and requirement is identical to new  parts, meaning that the same specifications, performance  requirements, warranty, and so on, apply. We allow our  customers to audit the quality of As-New modules. Our ambition is to increase the usage of As-New modules  in our systems, to prevent unnecessary scrapping of well- functioning parts and modules. In 2020, we took an  important step forward in our procedures by extending the  program to service parts, taking us into the next phase of  the As-New program. We are in the process of adopting this next phase, but this  will take time given that the qualification standards and  requirements are identical to new parts. We are looking at  our processes critically with the aim of simplifying them  while still ensuring high-quality standards. As-New has been well received by our business sectors.  There’s been an active pull on the program by the  manufacturing lines wanting to see more parts qualifying  for As-New. Our activities are closely linked to our supply chain. We are  efficient at shipping new parts to the field for service and  for new systems, but we need to place more attention on  improving the return flow. To tackle this, we have set up a  supply chain re-use team, which looks at re-use planning  and reverse logistics to improve the flow of the part. We  also operate a re-use supplier network, connecting with  suppliers on re-use. Overall, ASML is taking ownership of repairs, not only  looking to the original owner, the supplier, but taking  ownership if a supplier is not able to carry out repairs. The first As-New SMASH pilot was successfully built  and shipped in mid-2020, a major milestone for both  the SMASH project and the overall As-New program.  SMASH is one of the advanced alignment sensors in our  scanners. Depending on the configuration, the recovery  value ranges from €35,000 to €60,000 per sensor.  Following a second pilot, this project moved to high- volume manufacturing in Q3 2020.  The SMASH As-New project is an early pilot for our  As-New program, helping to define what is needed  to requalify a module. The Wilton cross-sector team,  including Optical Fabrication, Planning, Logistics,  Warehousing, Technicians, Production Engineering,  Product Lifecycle Management and D&E have worked  together to implement the As-New processes and  procedures over a two-year period. We believe our approach supports our customers' ambition  to extend their installed base lifespan, draw the best value  from their capital, and underpins our broader circular  economy approach. Re-use challenges and roadmap We made good strides on re-use and are committed to  continuing to reduce waste streams. To fully embed our  Re-use vision however, there are several challenges to  overcome and processes to be defined. These include: • Configuration control: To re-use As-New parts in a  system requires traceability of those parts. This means  we need to be able to trace its history, where it comes  from, and know how many times it was used and  repaired. • Organization: Across our operations, there are a variety  of separate processes related to return and re-use. Our  Re-use department has been tasked with addressing  this, with a spotlight on aligning the overall end-to-end  process flow. • Repair engineering and processes: Part of our new  focus is to create awareness on design for re-usability,  and define processes around how to include re-use in  redesigns and engineering changes. In 2020, we have also added re-use to the different  milestones in the product generation process (PGP). This  means that re-use requirements are now part of the design  specs. In the ramp-up phase, we want to plan with re- usability in mind when we order new parts. And in the  volume release phase, we want to make sure the repair  procedures are also reduced for volume, and not just the  build procedures. Lifetime extension of mature  products Our refurbished products business, known as MPS (Mature  Products and Services), refurbishes and upgrades our  older lithography systems to extend their lives and offer  associated services. MPS’ customer base is wide and  active in a variety of markets, especially in the More than  Moore space. MPS focuses on the refurbishment of three product  families: the ‘classic’ PAS 5500 (around 2,000 systems and  customers worldwide), the first generation TWINSCAN AT  systems, and the first generation TWINSCAN XT systems.  Given the growing market and wider application space of  our PAS platform, ASML will invest significantly to extend  the lifetime of our PAS platform to at least 2030. For  TWINSCANs, we focus on measures to proactively  manage the announced end of life by guaranteeing the  availability of spare parts through 2021, with a program to  extend that as long as possible on a best-effort basis. Life cycle management Managing the continued availability of spare parts is key to  the extended lifetime service we offer. A well-maintained  ASML lithography system can last for decades and be  used by more than one fab. Many ASML lithography  systems start out in cutting-edge fabs – once that fab  needs to upgrade, the lithography systems are given a new  lease of life in a fab where the manufacturer requires  comparatively less sophisticated chips, such as  accelerometers or radiofrequency chips. Almost every  lithography system that we’ve ever shipped is still in use at  a customer fab today. We are making significant investments to ensure continued  supply for our PAS platform, either through redesigns, a  parts harvesting strategy or finding an alternative with  same form, fit and function. If this does not work, we are  generally able to secure components through Last Time  Buy – a supplier's 'last call' for a part or component before  production switches to its successor. Over time, when that  is no longer workable, we redesign parts. Additionally, we track the spare parts we have in our  portfolio, see how they are being used, and when we  expect to run out of these parts. For the PAS systems, we  use this information to update our priorities for redesigning  parts. For the AT systems, we try to continue supplying  parts by harvesting them from systems that are  decommissioned by our customers. Customers are continuing to use the current PAS 5500  installed base to produce devices on 200 mm wafers and  below, and we foresee this demand growing. We set  ourselves the ambition and target to provide our customers  with a guaranteed service roadmap until at least 2030. To  this end, we guarantee our customers that all support, and  the necessary services and spare parts they need to  maintain their systems, will be available for at least the next  10 years. Lithography is applied in a wide range of life-changing  medical device research to manufacture implantable  devices. And more companies are getting active in this  market – one that is expected to reach more than one  million implants per year by 2030. These companies  are using our technology because of the superior stage  control for stitching accuracy, 3DAlign, and High Bow  Wafer handling in our design. Among these are neuroprobes, that can interface with  a human brain. Neuroprobes are being manufactured  using a PAS 350 by a startup company that will mass  produce brain machine interfaces (BMI). BMIs use brain  activity to control external devices, that will help people  with paralysis and inventing new technologies that will  expand our abilities, our community and our world. Dedicated resources MPS has a dedicated worldwide customer support network, which includes our own resources for field refurbishment and  D&E. Our competence center in Linkou, Taiwan, concentrates mature product knowledge in one place. We have more  than 250 specialized engineers in the field, working together with our customers. Our service engineers are an integral part of our customer-engineering teams, which jointly execute service tasks, as well  as being specialized in the more complex service activities that take place less often. These service engineers report back on what they see happening in the field. We use this intelligence to keep our  customers informed and establish if we need to devise a service product. Based on this, we continuously update our  redesign plans. As ASML’s technology and innovations evolve, the servicing of 20-year-old systems, and older, calls for expertise that is  not always readily available. In some cases, customer and ASML engineers with PAS 5500 expertise are retiring, while,  internally, engineers are attracted to our newer technology. It can be a challenge to maintain the competence of PAS 5500  service engineers, with expertise on the PAS systems, in the field. We seek to achieve this by developing a knowledge  base, training and job rotation. Ultimately, all ASML’s systems will become legacy products. So MPS is a key part of ASML’s offering, enabling our  customers to get the best value from their capital investment and at the same time support the circularity principles we  aspire to around the globe. Circular economy KPIs The table below shows the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the related 2025 targets. In 2019, we adopted a new  sustainability strategy - as a result no comparative results for 2018 are available for new performance indicators. See Non- financial statements - Non-financial indicators for our performance indicators (PIs) and related results. Construction waste is excluded from the calculation of this indicator, because this waste is not resulting from the daily operations of ASML. The amount of construction waste  tends to fluctuate over the years and can therefore make the trend of the indicator unclear.   2. Due to a definition change in 2020, the KPI is based on PAS5500 systems sold. For other PAS systems it is not possible to determine the status of use mainly because  service contracts have been terminated.  Contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals Our ambitions, commitments and programs as described in this chapter contribute to the following SDGs. For more  information on the performance, see section Non-financial statements - Non-financial indicators. SDG target 12.2 - By 2030, achieve the sustainable management and efficient  use of natural resources  • Material recovery • Promote circular procurement SDG target 12.4 - By 2020, achieve the environmentally sound management of  chemicals and all wastes throughout their life cycle, in accordance with agreed  international frameworks, and significantly reduce their release to air, water  and soil in order to minimize their adverse impacts on human health and the  environment SDG target 12.5 - By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through  prevention, reduction, recycling and re-use • Waste reduction • Increase re-use of parts and modules in our  products  • Lifetime extension of used systems • Re-use of packaging Climate change has become an urgent matter around the  world. It affects every country on every continent. It’s a  challenge that requires global responsibility to limit a  temperature rise worldwide to well below 2°C. It poses  risks, but also opportunities for all companies. At ASML, we’re committed to decreasing our greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere and reducing  our carbon footprint across our operations, as well as in  our value chain by enhancing the energy efficiency of our  products and utility installations that operates our  manufacturing building and offices. We aim to invent, develop and manufacture our products in  a more environmentally friendly way, striving to ensure that  our products are manufactured and can be operated  responsibly across their entire life cycle. Our renewable energy strategy sets out our ambition to  achieve zero emissions across our operations. We aim at  optimizing the efficiency of our utility installations in our  buildings as well as our manufacturing process. While  we’re increasing the productivity of our products, we're  also working towards reducing their energy consumption  to enhance our energy efficiency. Climate change risk and opportunities Climate change is a global challenge that requires urgent  action by everyone. This also impacts ASML. We identify  and assess the impact of climate-related risks and  opportunities through an Enterprise Risk Management  model. We assess risks both top-down (company-level)  and bottom-up (organization and process-level). Read  more in: How we manage risk - How we manage risk, How  we manage risk - Risk factors. We assess the risk related to climate change and its  impact, using the assessment guidelines of the Task Force  on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We  defined climate-related risks relevant to us, as well as risks  related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy. As  national governments respond to the threat of climate We are taking every step to lower our footprint to achieve zero emissions  across our operations. While increasing productivity of our products, we are also working towards enhancing the energy efficiency of our products. -30.8% Net emissions footprint (scope 1 & 2) change, political and regulatory risk increases. Our TCFD  Recommendations: climate-related disclosure is available  on www.asml.com. We have seven manufacturing sites around the world.  Veldhoven is the largest of these, representing 76% of our  total gross greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1 and 2  emissions). A signatory to the Paris Agreement, the  Netherlands has set its goal to reduce emissions by 49% in  2030, and expects a considerable contribution from  industry to achieve this. Should carbon pricing be  implemented, the financial cost of our energy consumption  will increase. The physical risks of climate change – e.g. extreme  weather conditions, chronic heat waves (drought) and the  rise of sea level (floods) – that could disrupt our operations  and/or damage our assets are evaluated regularly in our  Enterprise Risk Management process. The impact of these  risks is deemed limited, as our main facilities and suppliers  are not located in high-risk areas.   In addition, climate change may trigger issues concerning  the availability of natural resources, and energy or health  and safety matters. It may also indirectly impact the  political situation in a country, which may cause supply- chain disruption in first tier and beyond. We see that these  risks already exist in our industry. We monitor these, as  changes can occur at any time.  With increased global awareness of climate change,  managing the environmental impact of products is a  concern for our customers and other stakeholders, and  their preference may shift towards lower carbon-footprint  products. While helping the semiconductor industry to  continue to realize Moore’s Law, we are committed to  taking every step to lower our carbon footprint. 0.6 kt Value chain emission intensity (scope 3) Energy efficiency of our products Growing consumer demand for faster, ever-more  sophisticated devices in our increasingly interconnected  world fuels the need for constant innovation and  development in the semiconductor industry. Lithography is  one of the driving forces in creating more powerful, faster,  and cheaper chips. But just as the demand for enhanced  chip functionality increases, so does the complexity of our  lithography systems. Gross energy consumption of both  lithography-equipment manufacturers and chip  manufacturers is expected to rise, due to increasing IC  demand and energy consumption of the systems needed  to enable the production of higher-capability chips while  consuming less energy per chip while in use. asset installations. Climate change and the increase in  outside temperature will also force us to monitor the  cooling capacity in our factory locations. If necessary, we  may need to install more efficient and effective cooling  systems, which will reduce overall energy consumption of  the installed cooling capacity. We are committed to taking every step required to lower  our carbon footprint. Our sustainability strategy sets out  our ambition to achieve zero net emissions across our  operations by 2025. Read more in: Carbon footprint of our  operations. Climate and energy is a major focus area in our  sustainability strategy to combat climate change. Being at  the front end of the semiconductor value chain, our direct  contribution and influence on low carbon end-use products  is indirectly visible. Nevertheless, we recognize our  responsibility in this entire value chain ecosystem. Read  more in: What guides us, The role of lithography. By providing more innovative leading-edge lithography  systems to the IDMs and foundries, we contribute to a  more sustainable semiconductor production process (clean  tech). Besides the production process, our technology  enables our customers to design and manufacture more  powerful chips that consume less energy (low carbon) for  the end-markets. Not only are we focused on the end  products of our customers, we also a focus on energy  efficiency in their semiconductor manufacturing facilities. The Netherlands is part of the UNFCCC and a signatory  to the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement’s central  aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat  of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise  this century well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels  and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase  even further to 1.5°C. The Dutch government has set  a goal to reduce its GHG emissions by 49% in 2030.  Dutch industry's ultimate aim is to be circular and to emit  virtually no greenhouse gas by 2050. Factories will then  run on sustainable electricity from the sun and wind, or  energy from geothermal energy, hydrogen and biogas.  By 2030, the industry must already emit considerably  less CO2. That is an intermediate step on the way to  full sustainability. Politicians can implement measures  to achieve these goals, such as implementing carbon- pricing mechanisms to reduce GHG emissions. To enable this, chip manufacturers look to us to continue to  achieve lithography-enabled shrink with the aim of  producing higher-density chips. This translates into stricter  requirements for our systems, which means they use more  power to run. By increasing the productivity of ASML’s  lithography tools and with the higher resolution, more  products can be printed on a wafer. In addition, by  enhancing the resolution with EUV and High-NA, together  with scaling of overlay and pattern fidelity control, we  enhance energy efficiency of the produced chips while in  use. Our ongoing challenge is to meet our customers’  expectations of increasing the performance of our products  while also reducing their energy consumption. Our product-efficiency strategy Our product-efficiency strategy is based on making our  systems more efficient and improving the conversion  efficiency of wall-plug power into EUV light, while ensuring  we use energy in the most efficient way. Our focus areas  include: We want to increase throughput, both by increasing a  system’s source power and its efficiency by optimizing  sequences, control schemes and other components, such  as higher reflectivity mirrors and faster stages. The benefit  to our customers is the ability to produce more wafers per  day, as well as increasing capacity with the same number  of systems. This enables customers to increase  productivity without building a new fab, which translates  into less overall energy use. Most of these enhancements  are also offered as upgrades for the installed base tools.   A way to enhance energy efficiency in EUV relates to the  conversion efficiency of laser radiation into EUV. Most  energy is used in the conversion process, and it’s the key  focus area for our design efforts to make our systems more  efficient. If we can increase our conversion efficiency, we  can decrease a system’s energy consumption at constant  wafer output. Making this happen, while at the same time  limiting the energy loss by reducing the collector  degradation, pellicle transmission and mask defectivity are  the key challenges for our R&D teams. Managing our energy efficiency With our EUV systems now being used in high-volume  manufacturing at customer sites, reducing their energy use  has become a priority for us, our customers and suppliers. In 2020, we measured the energy efficiency of our EUV  3400C, which showed significant improvement compared  to its predecessor, the EUV 3400B. The energy  consumption decreased from 1.4 MW to 1.3 MW thanks to  more energy-efficient prevac systems, while productivity at  30 mJ resist dose increased from 107 wafers per hour  (wph) in 2018 to 136 wph in 2020.  We achieved a faster  run rate (higher throughput) for the system by significant  improvements in the transmission of the optical column  and improved wafer management, reducing the so-called  scanner overhead. In 2020, we also completed a pilot project at our factory in  Veldhoven aimed at reducing the energy used for the  hydrogen abatement system. Our systems need hydrogen  for protecting the optics in the scanner and the EUV  source. We tested more efficient vacuum pumps that  remove hydrogen from our systems, so our customers can  install them as well. We also found ways, together with suppliers, to use cooling  water of a higher temperature to remove the heat in the  lithography scanner and its source. This will reduce the  amount of energy needed to cool the system. In 2020, we  began investigating how this more energy-efficient cooling  method can be applied with the drive laser and started to  engage with our customers on it. As this involves  significant changes to the hardware of our suppliers and  installation in our customer fabs, this project is part of our  long-term plan to reduce the wall-plug power needed per  wafer pass by 60% by 2025 (baseline year 2018). If EUV  systems can operate in slightly higher temperatures, our  customers can save energy in cooling their factories.  Implementing energy-reduction and energy-efficiency  measures needs to be done carefully to limit the impact on  the uptime and productivity of our customers’ systems. Energy-efficiency challenges By 2025, we aim to reduce the energy use per wafer pass  of our future-generation NXE systems by 60% compared  to the previous model, the NXE:3400B (baseline 2018). To achieve this, we need to overcome several strategic  technical challenges. These include: ways to create EUV  plasma in the most efficient way; developing materials and  coatings dealing with higher EUV intensities; and improving  the heat management of optical components, including the  heat management of the wafer itself, which heats up  through the exposure light during the production process. These technical challenges are particularly tough to solve,  given that there is no precedent anywhere in the world. At  ASML, we need to find these solutions ourselves and this  type of experimentation presents all sorts of challenges.  Solving these challenges requires ongoing innovation and  relies heavily on the increased collaboration within our  ecosystem of customers, suppliers and knowledge  institutions. EUV and energy use EUV is characterized by single exposure. This means  several exposures can be replaced by one single exposure  (patterning of a chip). With EUV, the number of non-litho  processing steps can be reduced by up to three to five  times; this reduces the production cycle time significantly.  The fab also benefits from reduced energy use for the  deposition, etching and cleaning steps. Therefore, when  our customers use EUV systems to create faster and more  energy-efficient chips, the total energy consumption of the  fab might remain about the same as before, but with a  larger portion of the energy being used by (EUV)  lithography creating faster and more energy-efficient chips. Our next-generation EUV systems, High-NA (0.55NA), will  enable further shrink and partly eliminate complicated  exposure schemes involving several 0.33NA exposures by  a single 0.55NA exposure. With High-NA, the number of  non-litho processing steps can therefore also be reduced.  This will effectively limit the energy consumption per wafer  further. A semiconductor fabrication plant, commonly known  as a fab, is a factory where devices such as integrated  circuit (IC) chips are manufactured. These are the chips  we find in everyday electrical and electronic devices.  The making of a semiconductor device involves a  multiple-step lithography sequence to create a pattern  in the photoresist, as well as chemical processing,  during which electronic circuits are gradually created  on a silicon wafer. These steps include etching, ion  implantation, deposition and photoresist coating. ICs are made of layers, from about 0.005 to 0.1 mm  thick, that are built on the semiconductor substrate one  layer at a time, with perhaps 50 or more layers in a final  chip. After adding a layer, so-called deposition, the layer  is etched, using lines and geometric shapes in the exact  locations where the material is deposited. The entire manufacturing process, from start to  packaged chips ready for shipment, takes six to eight  weeks. All fabrication takes place inside the cleanrooms  of these fabs. In more advanced semiconductor devices,  such as modern 7 nm nodes, fabrication can take  between 11-13 weeks on average. The heart of a fab is the cleanroom, an area where  the environment is controlled to eliminate dust on a  nanoscale. All fabrication steps take place here. It also  houses the lithography system and other machinery  required for IC production. Under the desk floor is the so- called sub fab, which contains auxiliary equipment such  as the drive laser. The utility fab – where the pumping  and abatement systems for vacuum and cooling are  located – is usually found one floor below this. Note: 'dose energy in mJ' refers to the power density per second of expose per cm2. The  number of 'wafers per day' calculated assumes 100%  uptime and 100% utilization.   Preliminary results show that the total energy consumption of a patterning strategy with EUV is not necessarily higher than  that of the most complex multi-patterning DUV strategies.  The tables below provide an overview of our system performance achievements in terms of output and energy usage to  achieve this output.

We are doing this by enhancing the energy efficiency of our buildings and, where possible, shifting to  renewable energy. We also aim to reduce emissions in our value chain. We manage the environmental impact of our activities through a strong governance structure, chaired by our Chief  Operating Officer, and our ISO14001 certified management system. This is further supported by ASML’s sustainability  strategy, and our Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) policy. We review our environmental risks each year through our Enterprise Risk Management and business continuity processes.  Read more in: Howe we manage risk. We also assess the risks related to climate change, using the guidelines of the Task  Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). Read more in: Climate change risk and opportunities. Our TCFD  disclosure document is available on www.asml.com. Scope 1 emissions Compared to our peers in the semiconductor industry, our  energy consumption and related carbon footprint is  relatively low. As a manufacturer of lithography equipment,  our main direct CO2 emissions come from the fossil fuels  we use in the testing phase after the assembly of our  immersion lithography systems. This means our  lithography systems do not run full field in our operations. Scope 2 emissions Electricity accounts for nearly 80% of the energy we use at  ASML. Most of our electricity consumption relates to the  manufacturing of chip-making equipment – from assembly  to testing lithography and other systems – and maintaining  consistent climate conditions, such as constant  temperature, humidity and air quality. Achieving energy efficiency We view 2020 as a landmark year, achieving our goals set  out in our multi-year energy master plan for the period  2016-2020, and raised the bar for the next energy master  plan for 2021-2025. Despite the increase in number of  facility cleanrooms in recent years, we realized a 10%  energy saving compared to the 2015 energy-consumption  baseline. This translates to an achievement of 114 TJ  savings by year-end 2020, which is above our target of 111  TJ savings. We also reached our goal to use 100%  renewable electricity (scope 2). In doing so, we confirmed our commitment to minimizing the impact of our activities  on the environment by reducing our environmental footprint  and extending our commitment to renewable energy. Over the past 10 years, we have executed nearly 100  energy saving projects worth cumulatively over 260 TJ  savings, representing 28% of our energy footprint since  2010. Over the same period, our natural gas consumption  has dropped in absolute term from 382 TJ to 293 TJ as a  result of energy savings measures – and this despite the  growth and constructions of new facilities (cleanrooms and  offices). Projects we have run over the past few years to achieve  further energy savings are, for example, more energy- efficient technical installations and improvements in the  production process. These included measures such as the  recovery of exhaust heat, and efforts to reduce the energy  consumption of our cleanrooms, where maintaining the  right conditions is energy intensive. The projects were  completed and implemented in our operations in 2020,  with energy savings taking effect. Following on from the closure of the energy master plan  2016-2020, we developed a Climate & Renewable Energy  Sustainability program 2021-2025. Our target is to achieve  carbon neutrality in our operations for both scope 1 and  scope 2. While developing this plan, we reassessed in 2019 the scope of our energy and emissions reporting by  assessing materiality per real estate location, and the  environmental impact of activities at these locations. From this assessment, we concluded we needed to  expand the scope of reporting in terms of active locations:  from four main manufacturing sites in the 2016-2020  reporting years, to all industrial sites and offices with more  than 250 FTEs. This will result in an increase in our  reporting from 20 locations in 2020 to 57 locations in 2021.  This will increase our scope of reporting to over 95% of our  worldwide CO2 emissions. One of the ambitions in the field  of emissions and energy is to achieve direct energy savings  of 100 TJ by 2025. Renewable energy strategy In 2020, we achieved our goal of using 100% renewable  electricity through a combination of buying green  electricity and financing renewable electricity-generating  projects. Our ambition is to increase the share of direct  green energy purchases (so-called bundled renewable  electricity) from renewable electricity produced close to our  premises in the Netherlands, and reduce the share of  certificates. For the US and Asia, our ambition is to  purchase renewable energy attribute certificates  (respectively RECs and I-RECs) and monitor the evolution  of the renewable in those countries. All three hydro-energy plants in Norway that we co- financed through our GO2 project over the past few years  were finalized and in operation in 2020. They generate  26,000 MWh of energy per year, which is fed into the Dutch  grid. In 2021, we plan to install 4,700m2 solar panels on our  campus in Veldhoven, which are expected to provide the  equivalent of 3 TJ/yr capacity production. Optimizing our real-estate portfolio As we grow as a company, we strive to optimize our real- estate portfolio. The marked increase in working from  home following Dutch containment measures also  prompted us to take a closer look at the need for office  space and determine whether we may need less space  than anticipated. Optimizing the use of every square meter  in our portfolio contributes to reducing our environmental  footprint: each square meter saved is a square meter we  don’t need to heat, cool, ventilate or light up. Through the GO2 project, ASML has co-financed the  construction of three small hydropower plants in the  rugged countryside north and south of Bergen, Norway.  The Sandvik, Valdra and Nottveit installations are run- of-river power plants, which capture energy from fast- moving rivers and have a low local ecological impact. The last of the three power plants, the Nottveit plant,  became operational in 2020. Together, the plants have a  production capacity of 26,000 MWh of green electricity  annually, which is fed into the NorNed cable between  Norway and the Netherlands. Reviewing our value-chain carbon  footprint   We recognize that environmental impact goes beyond our  operations. In general, most of the environmental impact of  energy consumption in our industry comes from the use of  products, and the greenhouse gas emissions in the  downstream and upstream value chain. We use the guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol –  the organization that provides widely used international  standards for emissions reporting – for the calculation of  these scope 3 emissions. In 2019, we conducted our first  inventory of scope 3 emissions. In 2020, we focused on  maturing the data used and parameter assumptions  applied. Results shows that the indirect emissions (scope 3) from  upstream and downstream value chains account for  around 98% of the total emissions footprint (scope 1, 2  and 3). Of this, indirect emissions in the value chain, the  category ‘downstream' – use of sold products at our  customers’ sites – accounts for 60%, and the category  ‘upstream' – emissions related to the goods and services  we buy – accounts for 30%. The remaining 10% of our  scope 3 emissions relates to, among other things, activities  linked to transportation, business travel, and commuting. In 2020, we defined our scope 3 target for 2025. In this  process, we gave our best estimate for projecting  upstream and downstream emissions, guided by our  financial growth expectations. For more information, see  section Financial performance. Taking into account the change in product mix (an increase  in units of EUV systems), and the fact that our output in  terms of unit product manufactured is expected to  increase, the overall emissions in the entire value chain is  expected to rise. By executing our sustainability strategy  successfully, we can reduce the intensity of our scope 3  carbon footprint. The intensity is measured by the total  scope 3 emissions (in kton) normalized to the total  revenues (in € million). Recognizing that we depend on our suppliers, and that  most suppliers have not yet established greenhouse gas  inventory mechanisms, we also encourage our value chain  partners to work with us to jointly reduce greenhouse gas  emissions. In 2020, we introduced rail freight for shipments to Asia to  reduce CO2 emissions and costs. As a result of global  travel restrictions, the number of business travel decreased  significantly in 2020. When building new offices and manufacturing sites, we  take the opportunity to make our buildings as  environmentally sound as possible. With an eye on future  growth, for example, our new campus in Veldhoven is  designed with a strong sustainability focus. Its design and  use of materials will be assessed on sustainability  performance using BREEAM guidelines: we aim to achieve  a BREEAM score of ‘excellent’. From 2020 onwards, we  plan to adhere to BREEAM guidelines for all our new  buildings. Our environmental management system   We are committed to having an environmental  management system (EMS) in place that helps us monitor  our energy and emissions, improve performance, and  enhance efficiency. Our EMS is integrated into our  combined environmental, health and safety (EHS)  management system. All our facilities operate on the basis  of this EHS management system. Our EHS management  system is ISO:14001 certified, and structured in  accordance with ISO:45001 requirements. On November  2020 we received ISO:14001 re-certification for the next  three years. This certification gives our stakeholders  confidence in our commitment to achieving our  environmental goals. We measure progress in our emissions reductions by  monitoring our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, representing  three key performance indicators. Our participation in the  annual assessment by the Carbon Disclosure Project,  (CDP) a non-profit global disclosure program, also helps  steer our environmental initiatives. Our score in the most  recent CDP Climate Change 2020 assessment is C, which  is the same level as the sector average. In 2020, we received a fine for a missing environmental  permit for our facility in Beijing. We are in the process of  resolving the issue and obtaining the correct permit.  Nevertheless, no environmental incident occurred. Our plan to introduce product transportation by rail  freight accelerated, resulting in the delivery of a ‘move  set’ (the packaging and tools needed to relocate a  machine) from Veldhoven to China by rail for the first  time. Rail freight also debuted in Japan. Our supply chain team  ruled out ocean freight due to the lengthy six- to seven- week travel time, but realized that a hybrid option –  including rail – was a significantly better alternative. The  goods traveled from the Netherlands to China by train,  from China to Japan by ship, and finally to the supplier’s  location by truck. The total transport time was three and  a half weeks. Water management Semiconductor manufacturing processes use a lot of  water. It’s a scarce resource and availability is a global  challenge. Although water is an essential resource in the  semiconductor manufacturing process of our customers,  water use in our own operations is limited. ASML’s  products are designed to use water according to a ‘closed- loop’ (recycling) system. The aim of using water in our  manufacturing process is to keep the system cool against  the heat released during the exposure process. Water consumption at ASML is more than 20 times less  than most companies in the semiconductor industry.  Nevertheless, we promote the responsible use of water  throughout our company. Our water consumption in 2020  increased slightly to 860,000 cubic meters from 838,000  cubic meters in 2019, attributed to the expansion of the  manufacturing facility in Veldhoven and an increase in  product output. We use water from the municipal water  supply. While disruptions in access to water may represent a  significant risk for some of our customers, water-related  risk for ASML is limited. We have seven manufacturing  sites, of which the four main facilities are Veldhoven (NL),  San Diego (US), Wilton (US), Linkou (TW). Our main  facilities are not located in water high or extreme stress  areas as classified by the World Resources Institute (WRI).  Our San Diego site, however, is in a region where access to  water can pose a risk. The other facilities are located in  Beijing (CN), Pyeongtaek (KO) and San Jose (US). Activities  in these locations relate to the assembly of modules for our  lithography systems. 7,600 1.00 Climate and energy KPIs The table below shows the key performance indicators (KPIs) and the related 2025 targets. In 2019, we adopted a new  sustainability strategy - as a result no comparative results for 2018 are available for new performance indicators. See Non- financial statements - Non-financial indicators for our performance indicators (PIs) and related results. The 2018 measurement of the NXE:3400B is the baseline for the KPI target. No new systems have been introduced in 2019.   2. System-energy efficiency is measured according to the SEMI S23 standard, and scaled to 100% availability of our systems. Market-based conversion factors are used to calculate the scope 1 and scope 2 CO2 emissions in kton. The consolidation approach of emissions: financial control (as outlined  in the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’).  4. The guidance from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – the organization that provides widely used international standards for emissions reporting – is used for the  calculation of the scope 3 emissions. Contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals Our ambitions, commitments and programs as described in this chapter contribute to the following SDGs.

We have  experienced limited impact on our manufacturing  capability, although there have been additional challenges  with absenteeism, transportation and support logistics that  we have had to manage. Some of the quarantine  requirements have had an impact on our efficiency, while  travel restrictions posed challenges at times for our service  organization. Additionally, some of our suppliers  experienced temporary closures resulting from  governmental lockdowns in the first half of the year.  Despite all of these challenges, we successfully worked  with our customers and suppliers to find creative solutions  to support our operations. Customer demand remained strong throughout the year,  seen through a strong order intake and record sales. Many  investments of our customers are strategic and support  their technology roadmaps. However, we did experience  some impact in parts of the year. In the first half of the year,  some customers asked us to expedite the delivery of EUV  systems by shipping the systems before the normal  Factory Acceptance Tests (FAT). This resulted in revenue  recognition being delayed from shipment until after a  successful Site Acceptance Test (SAT) at the customer site,  each of which was completed before the end of Q3.  Additionally, there have been some delays in fab readiness  at customers, which delays timing of our shipments. We successfully navigated these challenges, resulting in  net sales growing by €2.2 billion in 2020 to €14.0 billion,  higher than we expected at the beginning of the year, as a  result of increased sales in the Logic market, Memory  market, as well as our installed base management  business. Logic grew by €0.8 billion, or 13%, compared to  flat initial expectations This was due to customers  continuing to see strong demand for both advanced and  mature nodes in support of the build-up of the digital  infrastructure, which includes secular growth drivers, such  as 5G, AI and high-performance compute. We expect  Logic demand to remain healthy for both leading edge and Leading the semiconductor industry by innovation, we have the right tools in place to execute our long-term financial strategy and expect to achieve continued sustainable growth for the years ahead. €14.0bn Net sales €11.8bn Asia   €1.7bn US   €0.5bn EMEA 48.6% mature nodes, due to further broadening of the application  space fueled by the global digital transition. Memory grew  by €0.5 billion, or 20%, relative to our 30% growth  expectations. While the growth related to the recovery of  the Memory market was substantial as customers saw  improving demand in data centers and consumer  electronics, it was lower than expected as customers'  allocation shifted more towards Logic throughout the year.  We expect this recovery in Memory to continue into 2021  as lithography tool utilization is already high, while  customers indicate inventory levels continue to come down  with expected further tightening of supply throughout the  year. Net service and field option sales grew by €0.8 billion,  or 30%, relative to our 20% growth expectations, driven by  an increase in the sales of productivity and focus upgrade  packages, in combination with a growing installed base.  Our services and upgrades business will continue to scale  as our installed base grows, with increasing contribution  from EUV service revenue as these systems run more  wafers in volume manufacturing. We expect significant  demand for upgrades, as customers utilize upgrades to  increase capacity and improve imaging and overlay  performance required on future nodes. €2.3bn Capital return €1.2bn Share buyback €1.1bn Dividend paid €8.49 In EUV, although our systems are still climbing the maturity  curve, we continue to see increased customer confidence  in the technology, which is translating into expanding layer  counts in Logic and initial deployment of EUV in Memory.  This led to EUV system revenue of €4.5 billion in 2020, an  increase of €1.7 billion compared to 2019. We successfully  increased our manufacturing output in 2020 to 35 systems,  however due to fab readiness of our customers, we  shipped 32 of these systems, recognizing revenue for 31  systems. The remaining 3 manufactured systems will ship  in early 2021. In our DUV business, we shipped the first NXT:2050i and  NXT:1470 in 2020. The NXT:2050i is based on a new  version of the NXT platform, where the reticle stage, the  wafer stage, the projection lens and exposure laser all  contain performance enhancements. With these  innovations, the systems deliver increased customer value  via improved performance in overlay and productivity, and  are therefore critical in supporting their next node  introductions. The NXT:1470 is the first dry NXT system  building on the NXT immersion platform, enabling  significant improvements in matched machine overlay and  productivity. This will help our customers deal with the  increasing cost of complexity when introducing new nodes.  The higher output per fab area from an NXT system also  maximizes fab capacity and therefore improves customer  profitability. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from  44.7% in 2019 to 48.6% in 2020, mainly attributable to  expansion in our EUV profitability and growth in our service  and upgrade sales. We continue to drive profitability of our  EUV systems and service business, and as a result have  started to achieve over 40% system gross margin and  positive gross margin on our service business in 2020. We  will continue to drive margin improvement in both systems  and service via cost reduction and delivering more value  leading to higher selling prices. We expect EUV systems to  reach corporate gross margins in the course of 2021, while  we expect EUV service margins to improve towards  corporate margins over the coming years. We continue to invest in the future of ASML, with a  significant increase in 2020 capital expenditures to  €1.0 billion. The increase is in line with our roadmap to  increase the value of EUV in high-volume manufacturing,  the development of High-NA, investments in capital  expenditures at our partner Carl Zeiss SMT, as well as  programs supporting our holistic lithography solutions in  DUV and Applications. We incurred an increase in our effective tax rate to 13.7%,  which is more in line with our expected long-term effective  tax rate. Our effective tax rate was lower in 2019 due to  one-time restructuring benefits and US Tax Reform  regulations. Liquidity and free cash flow were focus areas in 2020,  similar to 2019, however in 2020 we faced additional risk  and uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which  forced us to implement various cash preservation  measures early in 2020 to mitigate this risk and uncertainty.  Apart from COVID-19 risk mitigation, we started to see the  benefits of our working capital improvement initiatives in  Q4 2020, allowing us to grow our free cash flow by €1.2  billion in 2020 in connection with our €1.0 billion increase in  net income. We achieved this growth while continuing to  invest significantly in capital expenditures and R&D in  support of our roadmap and planned capacity ramp, as  well as being able to return excess cash to our  shareholders through growing dividends and share  buybacks, totaling €2.3 billion this year. We expect strong  free cash flow, increasing investments in the future and  significant cash returned to shareholders for next year. Overall, it was another strong year for ASML, driven by  continued strength in Logic, the start of a recovery in  Memory, growth in our installed base management, the  positive momentum in EUV, and sustained strength in our  DUV business. The expanding end-market applications  that fuel demand for both advanced and mature nodes  provide a sound basis for continued growth, and we  continue to be excited about the future. As a percentage of total net sales. For a comparison of ASML’s operating results for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the year ended December 31,  2018, please see Item 5.A of ASML’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019. ASML operations update on key performance indicators The following table presents the KPIs used by our Board of Management and senior management to measure  performance. For our five-year financial summary, read Other appendices - Appendix - Selected financial data. As a percentage of total net sales.  2. Lithography systems do not include metrology and inspection systems. 3. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as net cash provided by operating activities (2020: €4,627.6 million and 2019: €3,276.4 million) minus purchase  of property, plant and equipment (2020: €962.0 million and 2019: €766.6 million) and purchase of intangible assets (2020: €38.8 million and 2019: €119.3 million). We  believe that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric for our investors, reflecting cash that is available for acquisitions, to repay debt and to return money to our  shareholders by means of dividends and share buybacks. Purchase of property, plant and equipment and purchase of intangible assets are deducted from net cash  provided by operating activities because these payments are necessary to support the maintenance and investments in our assets to maintain the current asset base.

We saw growth in both Logic and Memory markets, which is a reflection of our customers' drive to innovate and continue  to invest in future technology nodes. Logic demand for the most advanced lithography systems remains healthy, and  Memory demand picked up in 2020 after a decline in 2019. Customers have indicated they are seeing signs of recovery  driven by healthy demand in data centers and consumer electronics. Growing insertion of EUV into DRAM manufacturing  translated into recovery of the Memory market towards the second half of 2020. The increase in Net sales is driven by EUV and Service and field options. We recognized revenue for 31 EUV systems in  2020 compared to 26 EUV systems in 2019. In addition to the higher number of units, the average selling prices in EUV  increased as a result of the transition to the high productivity NXE:3400C model. In addition to the growth in EUV, Service and field options sales were also a key driver for our overall growth in net sales.  The increase is driven by an increase in the sales of productivity and focus upgrade packages, supported by a growing  installed base. EUV contributed in a more meaningful way to net service and field option sales as our installed base  continues to grow and our customers continue to run more EUV systems in their high volume production.  Our system sales across our DUV technologies increased from 203 units in 2019 to 227 units in 2020, however given the  mix of technologies, DUV Net sales decreased by €0.4 billion in 2020. We successfully introduced our NXT:2050i and  NXT:1470 in 2020, and DUV will continue to drive value for our customers and be used in production in most layers of their  chips. Gross profit Gross profit increased as a result of both an increase in  sales and profitability. Gross profit as a percentage of net  sales increased from 44.7% in 2019 to 48.6% in 2020,  mainly attributable to improvement in our EUV profitability  and growth in our service and upgrade sales. We continue  to drive profitability of our EUV systems and service  business through cost reduction and by delivering more  value for our customers. €5,280 44.7% 48.6% 2020 €13,978 €13,978 €13,978 Research and development costs R&D costs were €2,200.8 million in 2020 as compared to  €1,968.5 million in 2019. The increase is in line with our  roadmap to bring EUV to high-volume manufacturing, as  well as our continued investments into the future through  the development of High-NA. R&D costs for both 2020 and  2019 were primarily focused on programs supporting our  holistic lithography solutions in EUV, DUV and Applications.  In 2020, R&D activities mainly related to: • EUV - Continued investments to increase the value of  EUV in high-volume manufacturing, the development of  the NXE:3600D, and further improving availability and  productivity of our installed base systems. In addition,  our roadmap includes High-NA, our next generation  0.55NA systems to support our customers with 2 nm  logic and beyond.  • DUV - The development of our latest-generation  immersion system NXT:2050i, as well as our latest  generation ArF dry system NXT:1470. In addition, we are  completing industrialization of new modules and further  improving our roadmaps on alignment/overlay and  productivity. • Applications - HMI expansion, including multi-beam  introduction, and further development of YieldStar and  process window control solutions. Selling, general and administrative costs SG&A costs increased by 4.7% from 2019 to 2020 due to  an increase in the number of employees and investments  in digitalization to support our growth. However, our focus  on efficiency has led to a reduction of SG&A as a  percentage of net sales from 4.4% to 3.9%. Income taxes The effective tax rate increased to 13.7% of income before  income taxes in 2020, compared to 6.8% in 2019, in line  with our generally expected annualized rate. The lower rate  for 2019 was a result of discrete tax benefits relating to  restructuring of our HMI group companies and US Tax  Reform regulations. Net income Net income in 2020 amounted to €3,553.7 million,  or 25.4% of total net sales, representing €8.49 basic net  income per ordinary share, compared with net income in  2019 of €2,592.3 million, or 21.9% of total net sales,  representing €6.16 basic net income per ordinary share. 16.7% 15.7% €6.16 6.8% 4.4% 3.9% EPS # of share (millions) 13.7% €8.49 €552 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 totaled €4.6 billion, an increase of €1.4 billion compared to 2019, which  is primarily due to an increase in Net income of €1.0 billion and improvements in working capital. These improvements can  primarily be seen through an increase in down payments from customers and a reduction of outstanding Accounts  receivable despite higher sales. This is partially offset by the increase in our Inventories to meet the upcoming customer  demand and increase in Finance receivables to provide customers systems with a free-use period before payment, either  for evaluation purposes or to support the capacity ramp-up of EUV as part of the early-insertion life cycle of the  technology. Cash provided from operating activities includes the sale of Accounts receivable through factoring  arrangements in 2020 totaling €2.2 billion, compared to €1.3 billion in 2019. Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities During 2020 we used €1.4 billion of Net cash for investing activities, mainly for purchasing €1.0 billion of Property, plant  and equipment and Intangible assets. In addition we acquired Berliner Glas, during the fourth quarter for a purchase price  of €257.1 million, having a net impact on our investing activities of €222.8 million after netting the cash received and  contingent consideration. The remaining activity is due to the timing of maturities and reinvestment of short-term  investments. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities Net cash used in financing activities amounted to €0.8 billion in 2020. We continued to return a substantial amount of cash  to our shareholders as seen through the annual growth of our dividend, paid semi-annually totaling €1.1 billion in 2020, as  well as share buybacks made during the year of €1.2 billion. This cash used in financing activities is partially offset by the  completion of two bond offerings during 2020 for a total of €1.5 billion. Cash flow analysis This year has been exceptional for companies worldwide, including ASML. We faced increased risk and uncertainty,  especially in the first half of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, despite having a healthy balance sheet,  as well as flexibility in our cost structure, we felt it prudent to preserve cash to protect our own operations, but also in  order to be able to support our suppliers as best we can in these extraordinary circumstances. These measures included  the pause of our share buyback program in Q1, later resumed in Q4, as well as issuing €750 million of senior notes due in  2029 in May 2020 as part of our cash preservation measures. This offering was in addition to our previous issuance of  €750 million of senior notes due in 2030 in February 2020. Free cash flow in 2020 increased by €1.2 billion, driven by an increase in Net income of €1.0 billion and improvements in  our working capital. Historically our EUV contracts did not include down payments, and actually provided extended  payment terms for customers, given the maturity curve of our EUV systems. Now we are moving into a direction where we  ask for down payments of EUV tools, reflecting the long lead times and early supply chain commitments that ASML has to  enter into. We have started to see the benefits of this in 2020, and expect further improvement in 2021. We continue to heavily invest in our next generation technologies in order to secure future growth opportunities which  requires significant cash investment in net working capital, capital expenditures and R&D. However, our capital allocation  policy remains unchanged. Cash that will not be required to support the future growth of our business, will be returned to  our shareholders through growing dividends and share buybacks.

In addition, we may from time to time raise  additional funding in debt and equity markets. We seek to  ensure that our principal sources of liquidity will be  sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements at all times. We maintain an available committed credit facility, with a group of banks, of €700.0 million, under which no amounts were  outstanding at the end of 2020 and 2019. This facility has a maturity date of July 2025 with an uncommitted 1-year  extension option. We further maintain a local uncommitted credit facility with a bank in China ensuring local liquidity and  operational requirements are met at all times, also given existing regulatory restrictions regarding flexible intercompany  funding. Capital structure Our objectives when managing our capital structure are to safeguard our ability to satisfy our capital providers by  maintaining a capital structure that ensures liquidity and supports a solid investment grade credit rating. The capital  structure includes both debt and the components of equity, in accordance with both US GAAP and EU-IFRS. The capital  structure is mainly altered by, among other things, adjusting the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, the amount of  share buybacks or capital repayment, and any changes in the level of debt. Our capital structure is formally reviewed with  the Supervisory Board each year in connection with our updated long term financial plan and relevant scenarios. The  outcome of this year’s review confirmed to maintain our historical financing policy in relation to our capital structure. Our current credit rating from Moody’s is A3 (stable) and from Fitch is A- (stable), which is consistent with the credit ratings  as of December 31, 2019.

Although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the  timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash  generated from operations, together with our other sources  of liquidity are sufficient to satisfy our expected  requirements, including our expected capital expenditures,  research and development expenses and debt servicing. We invest our cash and cash equivalents and short-term  investments in short-term deposits with financial  institutions, governments and government related bodies  that have investment grade credit ratings and in money  market and other investment funds that invest in high-rated  short and medium-term debt securities. Our investments  are mainly denominated in euros and to some extent in US  dollars and Taiwanese dollars. We have Eurobonds with an outstanding principal of €4.5 billion, having the following maturities: Cash return policy ASML aims to distribute a dividend that will be growing  over time, paid semi-annually. On an annual basis, the  Board of Management, upon prior approval from the  Supervisory Board, submits a proposal to the AGM with  respect to the amount of dividend to be declared with  respect to the prior year, taking into account any interim  dividend distributions. The dividend proposal in any given  year will be subject to availability of distributable profits,  retained earnings and cash, and may be affected by,  among other things, our view of potential future liquidity  requirements including for investments in production  capacity, working capital requirements, the funding of our  R&D programs and acquisition opportunities that may arise  from time to time. In addition to dividend payments, we  intend to return cash to our shareholders on a regular basis  through share buybacks or capital repayment, subject to  our actual and anticipated level of liquidity requirements  and other relevant factors. 0.46 0.53 0.61 0.70 1.05 1.20 1.40 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 0.0 2.10 2.40 ASML intends to declare a total dividend in respect of  2020 of €2.75 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim  dividend of €1.20 per ordinary share paid in November  2020, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the General  Meeting of €1.55 per ordinary share. This is a 15% increase  compared to the 2019 total dividend of €2.40 per ordinary  share. On January 22, 2020 we announced a new three year  share buyback program, to be executed within the 2020- 2022 time frame pursuant to which ASML expects to  purchase shares up to  €6 billion, which includes a total of  up to 0.4 million shares to cover employee share plans.  ASML intends to cancel the remainder of the shares  repurchased. This program was temporarily paused in the first quarter of  2020 in order to address the uncertainty related to  COVID-19, and subsequently resumed in the fourth quarter  of 2020. In 2020 we repurchased 3,908,429 shares (2019:  1,948,808 shares) for a total consideration of €1,207.5  million (2019: €410.0 million). Our tax policy is an integral part of our  sustainability strategy, which in turn is part of  our business strategy. Tax is included in the  materiality assessment for sustainability  purposes and is an element of our Corporate  Citizenship (corporate social responsibility). The  taxes we pay are an important part of ASML’s  contribution to the economies we operate in.  Tax is of continued interest to our stakeholders,  so we strive for transparency in the way we  report and pay our taxes in accordance with the  letter and the spirit of tax laws and regulations. Our policy is based on a well-defined set of principles and  internationally accepted standards. We support and adhere  to the principles on tax transparency and responsible tax  management as set out in the OECD Action Plan on Base  Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) and the EU Anti-Tax  Avoidance Directives (ATAD I and II). Tax governance Our globally organized tax department is responsible for  tax management. It falls under the supervision of our Board  of Management via the CFO, who is ultimately responsible  for the tax strategy. Our integrated global tax department is  spread over three hubs in the three regions in which ASML  operates and aligns on cross-border tax matters. ASML’s  global tax department is well connected to ASML’s  operations worldwide. This helps to ensure compliance  with applicable local tax laws and regulations. Tax filing  obligations are monitored via a central tax compliance  dashboard. Controls are implemented and executed via  our SOx and Internal Control Frameworks. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board (SB)  reviews our tax strategy and annually confers with our tax  professionals to discuss tax policies and the impact of tax  laws and regulations on ASML. ASML ANNUAL REPORT 2020 82 • We act in accordance with the letter and the spirit of tax laws and regulations. • We report taxable income in a jurisdiction commensurate with the added value of the business activities in that jurisdiction. • ASML’s profit allocation methods are based on internationally accepted standards as published by the OECD, as well as relevant  rules and regulations in the local jurisdictions we operate in. • We pursue an open and constructive dialogue with the tax authorities in the jurisdictions we operate in, based on mutual respect,  transparency and trust, disclosing all relevant facts and circumstances. We do not use tax structures intended for tax avoidance,  nor will we engage in the artificial transfer of profits to low tax jurisdictions. • We do not use tax havens (as defined by the European Commission’s ‘blacklist’) for tax-avoidance purposes. • We make tax disclosures in accordance with reporting requirements, US GAAP and IFRS.  Our tax principles We base our tax principles on our Code of Conduct. It guides us in how we report and pay tax in the countries we operate in. Our tax strategy ASML aims to report on and pay taxes in accordance with  all relevant tax laws and regulations. We commit to not only  comply with the letter of these laws and regulations, but  also with their intent. Training programs are in place in order to ensure that  global tax department members stay aligned and up to  date with latest developments in the global tax landscape.  Additionally, tax department members regularly provide tax  awareness sessions for stakeholders from business and  other finance departments. We aim to be clear about all aspects of our tax position and  to share these in a transparent manner, fostering a  relationship of honesty, transparency and trust with the tax  authorities. The latter is reflected in the number of bilateral  advance pricing agreements (BAPA) we have with the tax  authorities in our significant jurisdictions. ASML’s technology is driving our profitability. Around  90% of our income is taxable in the Netherlands as most of  our value creation through research, design and  manufacturing activities is based there. The income from  other activities, such as regional equipment sales and after- sales support, is subject to taxation in the countries where  these activities take place – the main ones being China,  South Korea, Taiwan and the US. To drive innovation, Dutch corporate income tax law  provides for the so-called Innovation Box facility. Based on  this facility, qualified income associated with R&D is  subject to an effective tax rate of 7% (increased to 9% as  of 2021), as compared to the Dutch statutory rate of 25%.  For more information see note 21 in the Consolidated  financial statements. Disclosures are provided in our financial statements and  cover tax payments in our main markets. We provide  country-by-country tax reporting in a transparent and  accurate manner to the tax authorities. A high level  overview of income taxes paid during 2020 is set out below  (in millions). Risk profile ASML is active in over 60 offices located in 16 countries.  The tax regulations in these countries are subject to  change, among others due to recent developments in the  international tax arena (e.g. BEPS 2.0). The tax regulations  are often complex and subject to interpretation. Failure to  comply with these tax regulations may lead to additional  tax assessments, including penalties. ASML ANNUAL REPORT 2020 83 €395.7 Asia United States Europe €190.1 €64.4 ASML’s tax strategy is aimed at maintaining a low tax-risk  appetite, for which it has set up a comprehensive tax risk- management framework. As such, via the organizational  structure of the global tax department, clear segregation of  roles and responsibilities as well as a strict internal review  and approval processes for tax filings, mitigates risks and  facilitates alignment with external parties. Tax Risk Management framework We aim to file all the required tax-relevant returns with the  appropriate tax authorities in a correct, timely and  complete manner. To ensure this happens, tax-compliance  & reporting processes are monitored through ASML’s  comprehensive corporate (SOx and Internal Control) and  tax control framework. The control frameworks are  regularly reviewed, tested and challenged by the ASML  Risk & Business Assurance department. Additionally, in  various areas automation is used for efficient and effective  monitoring of tax compliance obligations, validation of tax  relevant data and execution of tax compliance & reporting  processes. In these ways, we continue to focus on further  improvement and automation going forward. We discuss potential tax risks and our tax positions with  the Audit Committee on a regular basis. Additionally, in the  Netherlands, we participate in a cooperative compliance  program with the Dutch tax authorities.  Internal control on tax reporting is included in the overall  internal control statement, which is part of the  management report on internal control over financial  reporting. Trend information We expect 2021 to be another growth year supported by  healthy Logic demand and growth in the Memory market.  The expected growth is primarily driven by increasing EUV  sales, as well as growth in our installed base business. The  positive industry momentum around innovation and  expanding new markets further strengthen our confidence  in the 2021 outlook and our 2025 growth scenarios. In Logic, we see the major innovation drivers that fueled  increased demand for leading edge nodes in 2020,  continuing to drive demand in 2021. This is evident in  several customer announcements regarding ramp-up plans  for 7 and 5 nm nodes. In Memory, customers have indicated systems are  operating at higher utilization levels. As customers are  making the technology transition to support projected  growth, additional capacity additions are expected to be  required. Subsequently, this is expected to trigger  equipment demand. As a result, it seems likely that we will  see stronger lithography equipment demand from the  Memory market in 2021. Customers adopted EUV, and with increasing customer  confidence in EUV, this is translating into more layers in  their next nodes, for Logic production as well as the  adoption in Memory. We continue to see demand building  up for next years' shipments and expect a healthy order  flow to continue. Due to this demand increase, we expect  EUV revenue to increase around 30% in 2021. We expect further growth in our Installed Base  Management business as the demand for services will  continue to expand as our installed base grows.  Additionally, we anticipate an increased contribution to  service sales from EUV as more and more systems start  running wafers in volume manufacturing, as well as expect  significant demand for upgrades, particularly in EUV, as  customers utilize upgrades as a quick way to increase  capacity. • Total net sales of between €3.9 billion and €4.1 billion • Gross margin of between 50% and 51% • R&D costs of €620 million • SG&A costs of €165 million • Effective annualized tax rate of between 14% and 15% The trends discussed above are subject to risks and  uncertainties. See Special note regarding forward-looking  statements. Outlook 2025 In November 2018, we presented our long-term growth  opportunity up to 2025 in which we modeled revenue  scenarios within the context of different business  sensitivities. We recognize our growth opportunity is  primarily sensitive to market growth, with a projected  annual revenue for 2025 between €15 billion in a low- market scenario and €24 billion in a high-market scenario. Our next Investor Day is currently planned to take place on  June 23, 2021 in London, where we will update our 2025  expectations for the market developments since 2018. Our revenue potential is primarily based on organic growth.  We continuously review our product roadmap and have,  from time to time, made focused acquisitions or  equity  investments to enhance the industrial synergy of our  product offering. Based on such reviews and the  assessment of clear potential product and value synergies,  we may also evaluate and pursue focused merger and  acquisition activities in the future. Within this growth  ambition, we expect to continue to return significant  amounts of cash to our shareholders through a  combination of growing annualized dividends and share  buybacks. Dynamics in the global semiconductor industry present both opportunities and risks. ASML manages risk through  an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that integrates risk management into our daily business  activities and strategic planning. Enterprise Risk Management We deploy our ERM framework through a well-defined governance structure and a robust ERM process. The Risk and  Business Assurance function drives the ERM process and associated activities across ASML and its affiliates. It takes a  systematic approach to identify, manage and monitor risks in pursuit of our business objectives by setting standards and  enabling management to make ASML's governance, risk management, internal control and compliance more efficient and  effective. The function also helps to identify opportunities that allow us to achieve our objectives and enable continuous  sustainable growth. ERM is a continuous process. Its related activities are periodically repeated to identify and address risks in a timely  fashion, and its results remain relevant for decision-making purposes. Our Vice President of Risk and Business Assurance  is responsible for leading the development and maintenance of the ERM framework and makes sure the ERM process is  carried out. ASML has adopted the ISO 31000:2018 standard as the foundation of its enterprise risk management. In  addition, the Vice President of Risk and Business Assurance, reporting to ASML's CFO, is responsible for leading the  security, and internal control function and for the development and maintenance of the compliance process. Supervisory Board and Audit Committee  The Supervisory Board provides independent oversight on management’s response to mitigating critical risk areas based  on regular risk reviews. The Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee provides independent oversight on the ERM process  and the timely follow-up on priority actions based on quarterly progress updates.  Board of Management The Board of Management is responsible for managing the internal and external risks related to our business activities and  for making sure we comply with applicable legislation and regulations. The Board of Management has delegated its risk  oversight to ASML’s Corporate Risk Committee. Corporate Risk Committee The Corporate Risk Committee is a central risk oversight body, which reviews, manages and controls risks in the ASML  Risk Universe, including information security. It also approves the risk appetite, risk-management policies and risk- mitigation strategies. The Corporate Risk Committee is chaired by the CFO and comprises senior management  representatives from all sectors at ASML,  including the CEO, CSO and COO. Disclosure Committee  The Disclosure Committee assists the Board of Management in overseeing ASML’s disclosure activities and compliance  with applicable disclosure requirements arising under Dutch and US law and applicable stock exchange rules, and other  regulatory requirements. Internal Control Committee   The Internal Control Committee, which includes two members of the Disclosure Committee, advises the Disclosure  Committee and the CEO and CFO in their assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosures,  under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Chair of the Internal Control Committee updates the Audit Committee, the CEO and  CFO on the progress of this assessment. The Chair also includes this update in the report to the Audit Committee. Risk owners  Risk owners monitor the development of risks in the ASML risk universe and drive risk response across the ASML  organization according to requirements that are defined by the Corporate Risk Committee. ASML risk universe The ASML risk universe is a consolidated overview of the risks that may have a material adverse effect in achieving our  business objectives. It consists of 38 risk categories grouped into six risk types. This allows us to have a consistent view  across ASML when assessing risks. We take into account a broad range of internal and external information sources such as macroeconomic and industry  trends, relevant guidelines and legislation, and stakeholders’ needs and expectations in all areas. The risk universe is  reviewed, updated and approved on a yearly basis, or more frequently in case of significant internal and/or relevant  external developments. Enterprise Risk Management process Our ERM process provides a holistic approach combining both top-down (company-level) and bottom-up (organization-  and process-level) perspectives. This helps us to ensure that risk identification, evaluation, and management are  performed at the right level. The results from periodic risk-assessments and potential impact of external trends are captured in the ASML risk  landscape. As we operate in a dynamic environment, risk exposures are subject to change. The ASML risk landscape is  reviewed, updated and discussed by the Corporate Risk Committee each quarter. The execution of the risk assessments is done according to the risk management plan and any additional engagement  approved by the Corporate Risk Committee. We define strategies to address relevant risks and take these into account  when we define the corporate priorities. ASML defines risk responses with the aim to mitigate the risks up to the level  defined by the risk appetite. Risk appetite  Our risk appetite depends on the nature of the risk. ASML’s risk appetite – the level of risk ASML is willing to accept to  achieve its objectives – may vary based on the specific risk and is divided in five levels: Averse, Prudent, Moderate, High  and Extensive. Our approach is geared towards mitigating the risks to the level defined in our risk appetite. Risk developments The table below presents examples of external developments that have affected the exposure of a series of risk categories  in 2020, including examples of our responses. The list of risks and risk responses below is not exhaustive. Examples of such risks are: • Our employees may face health risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.  • The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the level of remote working within our  organization, which impacts productivity, may delay our roadmap, increase the risks of  cybersecurity incidents and may impact our control environment.  • We are dependent on our suppliers, so disruptions to their operations as a result of the  COVID-19 pandemic impact us and our ability to produce, deliver and service tools.  • Market demand for semiconductors and therefore our tools and services can change. • An important part of our business involves installing and servicing tools at customer  premises around the globe. Current travel restrictions impact that activity. The full impact of this pandemic on ASML will depend on future developments. This includes  its continued severity, and the actions taken to contain the pandemic or address its impact  which are outside of our control.  So far, the COVID-19 pandemic had limited impact on our results of operations. • Code of Conduct and Business Principles • Corporate policies such as Anti-bribery & corruption, Anti-fraud, Antitrust, Insider trading, Tax and Export control • Speak Up policy and system • Implementation of global compliance program  • Establishment of Privacy Office and implementation of personal data protection program including, among others, the following  elements: governance, systems & procedures, disciplinary actions, audits. COVID-19 has spread globally, leading to quarantines, travel and workplace restrictions,  business shutdowns and restrictions, supply chain interruptions, labor shortages, changes of  legislation and overall economic and financial market instability.      The pandemic has a significant impact on the global economy. Going forward, there is  uncertainty on how the pandemic will develop, and its impact on global GDP development,  (end) markets, and our manufacturing capability and supply chain. The longer the pandemic  lasts, the greater the risks. Rules and regulations are becoming more complex, in particular those relating to trade,  national security, tax, exchange controls, reporting, anti-corruption laws, climate change, data  protection, product safety.  We are committed to full compliance with relevant laws and regulations. Export restrictions are rising and global trade is shifting from globalization to regionalization,  particularly between China and US. This may lead to a decoupled ecosystem. Trade and  export barriers have impacted our ability to sell and maintain systems to certain customers  and impact our business by limiting our ability to sell our products and services in certain  jurisdictions or to certain customers.     Geopolitical tensions also result in movement restrictions of the employees across countries.  Protectionism and bureaucracy are increasing, as well as restrictions impacting international  knowledge workers from certain countries, (e.g. restricted technology access, visa/travel  restrictions).    We aim to serve and support all our customers around the world to the best of our ability,  while being compliant with laws and regulations set by the jurisdictions where we operate. There is an increased pressure on know-how and IP protection for ASML and its open  innovation partners. ASML’s existence is based on people and knowledge. Unauthorized  disclosure of information of ASML, its customers or suppliers may benefit competitors,  negatively affect ASML’s ability to file patents or affect cooperation with customers and  suppliers.     We are experiencing an increasing number of cyberattacks on our information technology  systems as well as the information technology systems of our suppliers, customers and other  service providers.    We are committed to protect our information assets and those of our partners. from the pandemic. In conducting our business, we face many risks that  may interfere with our business objectives. It is  important to understand the nature of these risks. We  assess our risks by using the ASML risk universe,  consisting of six risk types (Strategy and Products,  Finance and reporting, Partners, People, Operations,  Legal and compliance). The risk categories related to  the Risk factors below. Any of these risks and events or  circumstances described therein may have a material  adverse effect on our business, financial condition,  results of operations and reputation. These risks are  not the only ones that we face. Some risks may not yet  be known to us, and certain risks we do not currently  believe to be material could become material in the  future. Many of the risks described below may be  exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, global  measures taken in response, and any worsening of the  global business and economic conditions resulting Our success in developing new technologies, products,  and in enhancing our existing products, depends on a  variety of factors. These include the success of our and our  suppliers’ R&D programs and the timely and successful  completion of product development and design relative to  competitors. Our business will suffer if the technologies we  pursue to assist our customers in producing smaller and  more energy-efficient chips are not as effective as those  developed by competitors, or if our customers do not  adopt technologies that we develop or adopt new  technological architectures that are less focused on  lithography products. The success of our EUV technology,  which we believe is critical for keeping pace with Moore’s  Law, remains dependent on continuing technical advances  by us and our suppliers. We invest considerable financial  and other resources to develop and introduce new  technologies, products and product enhancements. If we  are unsuccessful in developing (or if our customers do not  adopt) new technologies, products and product  enhancements such as High-NA and multi-beam, or if  competitors successfully introduce alternative technologies  or processes, our competitive position and business may  suffer, and we may be unable to recoup some or all of the  investments that we have made. We may incur costs related to inventory obsolescence, as  a result of technological changes. Such costs may increase  as the complexity of technology increases. Due to the highly complex nature and costs of our  systems, including newer technologies, our customers may  purchase existing technology systems rather than new  leading-edge systems, or may delay their investment in  new technology systems to the extent that such  investment is not economical or required given their  product cycles. Global economic conditions affect our Our lithography systems and applications have become  increasingly complex, and accordingly, the costs and time  period to develop new products and technologies have  increased. We expect such costs and time periods to  continue to increase. In particular, developing new  technology, such as High-NA and multi-beam, requires  significant R&D investments by us and our suppliers to  meet our and our customers’ technology demands. Our  suppliers may not have, or may not be willing to invest the  resources necessary to continue the (co-)development of  the new technologies to the extent that such investments  are necessary. This may result in ASML contributing funds  to such R&D programs or limiting the R&D investments that  we can undertake. Furthermore, if our R&D programs are  not successful in developing the desired new technology  on time or at all, we may be unsuccessful in introducing  new products and unable to recoup our R&D investments. The lithography equipment industry is highly competitive.  Our competitiveness depends upon our ability to develop  new and enhanced lithography equipment, related  applications and services that are competitively priced and  introduced on a timely basis, as well as our ability to  protect and defend our intellectual property rights. We  compete primarily with Canon and Nikon in respect of DUV  systems. Both Canon and Nikon have substantial financial  resources and broad patent portfolios. Each continues to  offer products that compete directly with our DUV systems,  which may impact our sales or business. In addition,  adverse market conditions, industry overcapacity or a  decrease in the value of the Japanese yen in relation to the  euro, could further intensify price-based competition,  resulting in lower prices, and lower sales and margins. We may also face competition from new competitors with  substantial financial resources, as well as competitors  driven by the ambition of self-sufficiency in the geopolitical  context. Furthermore, we face competition from alternative customers’ investment decisions, leading to uncertainties  on the timing around the introduction of and demand for  new leading-edge systems. Some of our customers have  experienced and may continue to experience delays in  implementing their product roadmaps. This increases the  risk of slowing down the overall transition period (or  cadence) for the introduction of new nodes, and therefore  new systems. We are also dependent on our suppliers to maintain their  development roadmaps to enable us to introduce new  technologies on a timely basis. If they are unable to keep  pace, whether due to technological factors, lack of financial  resources, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or  otherwise, this could prevent us from meeting our  development roadmaps. technological solutions or semiconductor manufacturing  processes, particularly if we are unsuccessful in developing  new EUV technology, products and product enhancements  in a timely and cost competitive manner. We also compete with providers of applications that  support or enhance complex patterning solutions, e.g.  Applied Materials Inc. and KLA-Tencor Corporation. These  applications effectively compete with our Applications  offering, which is a significant part of our business. The  competition we face in our applications business may be  higher than for our systems, as there are more competitors  and potential competitors in this market. As a supplier to the global semiconductor industry, we are  subject to the industry’s business cycles, of which the  timing, duration and volatility are difficult to predict. The  semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical.  Newer entrants in the industry, including Chinese entrants,  could increase the risk of cyclicality in the future. Certain  key end-market customers – Memory and Logic – exhibit  different levels of cyclicality and different business cycles.  Sales of our lithography systems, services and other  holistic lithography products depend in large part upon the  level of capital expenditures by semiconductor  manufacturers. These in turn are influenced by industry  cycles and a range of competitive and market factors,  including semiconductor industry conditions and  prospects. The timing and magnitude of capital  expenditures of our customers also impact the available  production capacity of the industry to produce chips,  which can lead to imbalances in the supply and demand of  chips. Reductions or delays in capital expenditures by our  customers, including as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic, or incorrect assumptions by us about our  customers’ capital expenditures, could adversely impact  our business. Our ability to maintain profitability in an industry downturn  will depend substantially on whether we are able to lower  our costs and break-even level, which is the level of sales  that we must reach in a year to have positive net income. If  sales decrease significantly as a result of an industry  downturn and we are unable to adjust our costs over the  same period, our net income may decline significantly or  we may suffer losses. Furthermore, as the value per system  increases and we have grown, and continue to grow, in  terms of employees, facilities and inventories, it may be  more difficult for us to reduce our costs to respond to an  industry downturn. We derive most of our revenues from the sale of a relatively  small number of lithography systems: (258 units in 2020  and 229 units in 2019). As a result, the timing of shipments,  including any delays, and recognition of system sales for a  particular reporting period from a small number of systems  may have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial condition and results of operations in that period.  This risk is increasing due to the higher average sales price  of EUV systems as compared to DUV systems. We rely on intellectual property rights such as patents,  copyrights and trade secrets to protect our proprietary  technology and applications. However, we face the risk  that such measures could prove to be inadequate and we  could suffer material harm because, among other things: • Intellectual property laws may not sufficiently support  our proprietary rights or may change in the future in a  manner adverse to us;  • Patent rights may not be granted or interpreted as we  expect;  • Patents will expire which may result in key technology  becoming widely available that may harm our  competitive position;  • The steps we take to prevent misappropriation or  infringement of our proprietary rights may not be  successful; and  • Third parties may be able to develop or obtain patents  for similar competing technology. In addition, legal proceedings may be necessary to enforce  our intellectual property rights, to determine the validity and  scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend  against claims of infringement. Any such proceedings may  result in substantial costs and diversion of management  resources, and, if decided unfavorably to us, could result in  significant costs or have a significant impact on our  business. We are increasingly subject to attempted misappropriation  attacks, including theft of our trade secrets, proprietary  customer data, intellectual property or other confidential  information by third parties or our own employees. For  example, in the past we have been subject to the  misappropriation of our software by certain employees. In the course of our business, we are subject to claims by  third parties alleging that our products or processes  infringe upon their intellectual property rights. If successful,  such claims could limit or prohibit us from developing our  technology, manufacturing and selling our products. In addition, our customers or suppliers may be subject to  claims of infringement from third parties, alleging that our  products used by such customers in the manufacturing of  semiconductor products and / or the processes relating to  the use of our products infringe on one or more patents  issued to such third parties. If such claims are successful,  we could be required to indemnify our customers or  suppliers for some or all of any losses incurred or damages  assessed against them as a result of such infringement. In addition, we aim to derive more revenue from servicing  and upgrading our installed base. However, we may not be  able to increase revenues to the extent we planned as, for  example, customers may perform more of these services  themselves or find other third party suppliers for that  service. We also may incur substantial licensing or settlement costs  to settle disputes or to potentially strengthen or expand our  intellectual property rights or limit our exposure to  intellectual property claims of third parties. We were subject to a number of patent infringement claims  by Nikon between 2017 and 2019. While we settled the  litigation with Nikon in 2019, we continue to face the risk  that we may be subject to claims alleging the infringement  of others’ patents or intellectual property rights or involved  in patent litigation to defend our intellectual property rights. Patent litigation is complex and may extend for a  protracted period of time, giving rise to the potential for  both substantial costs and diverting the attention of key  management and technical personnel. Potential adverse  outcomes from patent litigation may include payment of  significant monetary damages, injunctive relief prohibiting  our manufacturing, exporting or selling of products, and /  or settlement involving significant costs to be paid by us. Global trade issues and changes in and uncertainties with  respect to multilateral and bilateral treaties and trade  policies, including the ability to obtain required licenses and  approvals and the effects of trade sanctions, export  controls, tariffs and similar regulations and international  trade disputes, impact our ability to produce and deliver  our systems and services internationally. Certain of our manufacturing facilities as well as customers  are located in Taiwan. Customers in Taiwan represented  33.8% of our 2020 total net sales and 45.3% of our 2019  total net sales. Taiwan has a unique international political  status. The People’s Republic of China asserts sovereignty  over Taiwan and does not recognize the legitimacy of the  Taiwanese government. Changes in relations between  Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China, Taiwanese  government policies, and other factors affecting Taiwan’s  political, economic or social environment could have a  material adverse effect on our business, financial condition  and results of operations. Furthermore, certain of our  facilities as well as customers are located in South Korea.  Customers in South Korea represented 29.7% of our 2020  total net sales and 18.6% of our 2019 total net sales. There  are tensions with the Democratic People’s Republic of  Korea (North Korea), which have existed since the division  of the Korean Peninsula following World War II. A  worsening of relations between those countries or the  outbreak of war on the Korean Peninsula could have a  material adverse effect on our business, financial condition  or results of operations. We have a presence or do business in a number of  jurisdictions, including the People’s Republic of China and  Russia. In particular, our business in People’s Republic of  China has increased in recent years and is expected to  increase further. Such increased presence increases the  risks we face, including risks relating to compliance with  multilateral and bilateral treaties, delays in receipt of  appropriate permits, compliance with anti-corruption and  anti-bribery laws and regulations, our ability to effectively  manage and control our growing business, attracting and  retaining sufficiently qualified personnel, the protection of  our intellectual property and information technology From time to time we acquire, and may in the future  acquire, businesses or technologies to complement,  enhance or expand our current business or products or  that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. For  example, we recently completed the acquisition of Berliner  Glas, a privately held manufacturer of ceramic and optical  modules to support the future roadmap for our EUV and  DUV products. Any such acquisitions could lead to failure  to achieve our financial or strategic objectives, to perform  as we plan or disrupt our ongoing business and adversely  impact our results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to  complete such transactions may be hindered by a number  of factors, including potential difficulties in obtaining  government approvals. Any acquisition that we make could pose risks related to  the integration of the new business or technology with our  business and organization. We cannot be certain that we  will be able to achieve the benefits we expect from a  particular acquisition investment. Such transactions may  also strain our managerial and operational resources, as  the challenge of managing new operations may divert our  management from day-to-day operations of our existing  business. Furthermore, we may be unable to retain key  personnel of acquired businesses or may have difficulty  integrating employees, business systems, and technology.  The controls, processes and procedures of acquired  businesses may also not adequately ensure compliance  with laws and regulations, and we may fail to identify  compliance issues or liabilities. systems, and restrictions on repatriation of cash abroad.  For example, we have experienced, and are continuing to  experience, delays in processing work permits for foreign  nationals, which could potentially delay development and  support provided to customers. The US administration has enacted trade measures,  including import tariffs and restrictions on conducting  business with certain Chinese entities, restricting our ability  to provide products and services to such entities without a  license. The list of Chinese entities impacted by trade  restrictions, as well as the export regulation requirements  are subject to change. Our business involves the sale of  systems and services to customers in a number of  countries, including China, where our business has grown  in recent years, and includes sensitive technologies that  may be the subject of increased export regulations,  policies or practices. These and further developments in  multilateral and bilateral treaties, national regulation, and  trade, national security and investment policies and  practices have affected and may further affect our  business, and the businesses of our suppliers and  customers. Such developments can impact our ability to  obtain necessary permits, including permits for use of US  technology and for employees producing and developing  such technology. Such developments could also lead to  long-term changes in global trade, competition and  technology supply chains, which could adversely affect our  business and growth prospects. assets or other conditions that could make it difficult for us  to integrate the businesses that we acquire. Furthermore,  as the industry is becoming more consolidated, anti-trust  and national-security clearances may become harder to  obtain, which could inhibit future desired acquisitions. As a result of acquisitions, we have recorded, and may  continue to record, a significant amount of goodwill and  other intangible assets. Current accounting guidelines  require, at least annually and potentially more frequently,  assessment of whether there are indicators that the value  of goodwill or other intangible assets has been impaired. Companies across all industries are facing increasing  scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Investors and other  stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG practices  and, in recent years, have placed increasing importance on  the implications and social cost of their investments. In  particular, within the semiconductor industry, there is focus  on contribution to society and minimizing environmental  and social impacts of products throughout all life cycle  stages. Failure to achieve our ESG objectives and meet the  emerging ESG expectations of our stakeholders could  negatively affect our brand, reputation and license to  operate, and may also increase our vulnerability to ESG- related risks, such as risks associated with climate change  in the medium- to long-term. Furthermore, our ability to  achieve our product-related environmental objectives (such  as energy efficiency) may be affected by the complexity of  our technology and products, and the technological and  other capabilities of ourselves and our suppliers. A global transition to a lower carbon economy and / or  climate change may result in the imposition of increased  environmental regulations that could lead to technology  restrictions, modification of product designs, an increase in  energy prices and the introduction of energy or carbon  taxes, pollution requirements, required remediation  equipment, or other requirements. A variety of regulatory  developments have been introduced that focus on  restricting or managing the emission of carbon dioxide,  methane and other greenhouse gases. This could result in  a need to purchase at higher costs new equipment or raw  materials with lower carbon footprints. We are a global company and are exposed to a variety of  financial risks, including liquidity risk, interest rate risk,  credit risk and foreign exchange risk. Liquidity risk: Negative developments in our business or  global capital markets could affect our ability to meet our  financial obligations or to raise or re‐finance debt in the  capital or loan markets. Interest rate risk: We are exposed to interest rate risks.   Our Eurobonds bear interest at fixed rates. Our cash and  investments as well as our revolving credit facility bear  interest at a floating rate. Failure to effectively hedge this  risk could impact our financial condition and results of  operation. In addition, we could experience an increase in  borrowing costs due to a ratings downgrade (or  expectation of a downgrade), developments in capital and  lending markets or developments in our businesses. Counterparty credit risk: We are exposed to  counterparty credit risks, in particular with respect to  financial counterparties with whom we hold our cash  and investments as well as our customers. As a result  of our limited number of customers, credit risk on our  receivables is concentrated. Our three largest customers  (based on total net sales) accounted for €2,757.0 million,  or 80.1%, of accounts receivable and finance receivables  at December 31, 2020, compared with €2,191.8 million,  or 77.2%, at December 31, 2019. Accordingly, business  failure or insolvency of one of our main customers could  result in significant credit losses. Currency risk: We are exposed to currency risks. Our  Financial Statements are expressed in euros. Accordingly,  our results of operations are exposed to fluctuations in  exchange rates between the euro and other currencies.  Changes in currency exchange rates can result in losses in  our Financial Statements. We are particularly exposed to  fluctuations in the exchange rates between the US dollar  and the euro, and to a lesser extent to the Japanese yen,  the South Korean won, the Taiwanese dollar and Chinese  yuan, in relation to the euro. We incur costs of sales  predominantly in euros with portions also denominated in  US and Taiwanese dollars. A small portion of our operating  results are driven by movements in currencies other than  the euro, US dollar, Japanese yen, South Korean won,  Taiwanese dollar or Chinese yuan. In general, our customers run their businesses in US  dollars and therefore a weakening of the US dollar against  the euro might impact the ability or desire of our customers  to purchase our products at quoted prices. We rely on outside vendors for components and  subassemblies used in our systems, including the design  thereof. These components and subassemblies are  obtained from a single supplier or a limited number of  suppliers. As our business has grown, our dependence on  single suppliers or a limited number of suppliers has  grown, as the highly specialized nature of many of our  components, particularly for EUV systems, means it is not  economical to source from more than one supplier. Our  sourcing strategy therefore (in many cases) prescribes  'single sourcing, dual competence'. Our reliance on a  limited group of suppliers involves several risks, including a  potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required  components or subassemblies, in a timely manner or at all,  additional costs resulting from switching to alternate  suppliers and reduced control over pricing and quality.  Delays in supply of these components and subassemblies,  which could occur for a variety of reasons, such as  disruptions experienced by our suppliers, including work  stoppages, fire, cyberattacks, energy shortages, pandemic  outbreaks such as COVID-19, flooding or other natural  disasters, can lead to delays in delivery of our products  which would impact our business. For example, certain of  our suppliers experienced disruptions in their operations as  a result of COVID-19. A prolonged inability to obtain  adequate deliveries of components or subassemblies, or  any other circumstance that requires us to seek alternative  sources of supply, could significantly hinder our ability to  deliver our products in a timely manner, which could  damage relationships with our customers and materially  impact our business. The number of lithography systems we are able to produce  may be limited by the production capacity of one of our  key suppliers, Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH, which is our sole  supplier of lenses, mirrors, illuminators, collectors and  other critical optical components (which we refer to as  optics). If Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH is unable to maintain and  increase production levels, we could be unable to fulfill  orders, which could have a material impact on our  business and damage relationships with our customers. If  Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH were to terminate its supply  relationship with us or if Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH is unable to  maintain production of optics over a prolonged period, we  would effectively cease to be able to conduct our business. In addition, some of our key suppliers, including Carl Zeiss  SMT GmbH, have a limited number of manufacturing  facilities, the disruption of which may significantly and  adversely affect our production capacity. Lead times in obtaining components have increased as our  products have become more complex, and a failure by us  to adequately predict demand for our systems or any  delays in the shipment of components can result in  insufficient supply of components, which can lead to  delays in delivery of our systems and can limit our  capabilities to react quickly to changing market conditions.  Conversely, a failure to predict demand could lead to  excess and obsolete inventory. Historically, we have sold a substantial number of  lithography systems to a limited number of customers.  Customer concentration can increase because of  continuing consolidation in the semiconductor  manufacturing industry. In addition, although the  applications part of our holistic lithography solutions  constitutes an increasing portion of our revenue, a  significant portion of those customers are the same  customers as those of our systems. Consequently, while  the identity of our largest customers may vary from year to  year, sales may remain concentrated among relatively few  customers in any particular year. The recognized total net  sales to our largest customer from each year accounted  for €4,394.8 million, or 31.4% of total net sales in 2020,  compared with €4,688.6 million, or 39.7% of total net sales  in 2019 and €2,476.8 million, or 22.6% of total net sales in  2018. The loss of any significant customer or any  significant reduction or delay in orders by a significant  customer may have a material adverse effect on our  business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business and future success significantly depends  upon our employees, including a large number of highly  qualified professionals, as well as our ability to attract and  retain employees. Competition for such personnel is  intense and has increased in recent years, and we may not  be able to continue to attract and retain such personnel.  Our R&D programs require a significant number of qualified  employees. If we are unable to attract sufficient numbers of  qualified employees, this could affect our ability to conduct  our R&D on a timely basis. In addition, if we lose key  employees or officers to retirement, illness or otherwise,  particularly a number of our highly qualified professionals  and / or senior management, we may not have sufficient  time to find a suitable replacement. Moreover, as a result of  the uniqueness and complexity of our technology, qualified  engineers capable of working on our systems are scarce  and generally not available (e.g. from other industries or  companies). As a result, we must educate and train our  employees to work on our systems. Therefore, a loss of a  number of key professionals and / or senior management  can be disruptive, costly and time consuming. Our R&D  activities with respect to new technology systems, such as  High-NA and for further development of EUV technology,  and our service activities have increased our need for  qualified personnel. We are also dependent on suppliers to develop new  models and products and to meet our development  roadmaps. To the extent our suppliers do not meet our  requirements or timetable in product development, our  business could suffer. employees and suppliers leading to an inability to decrease  cycle times and may result in the occurrence of significant  additional costs. Our suppliers face similar risks in  attracting qualified employees, including attracting  employees in connection with R&D programs that will  support our R&D programs and technology developments.  To the extent that our suppliers are unable to attract  qualified employees, this could impact our R&D programs  or deliveries of components to us. In recent years, our organization has grown significantly. As  a result of this growth in a short period of time, we may be  unable to effectively manage, monitor and control our  employees, facilities, operations and other resources. Bringing our products to high-volume production at a  value-based price and in a cost-effective manner, depends  on our ability to manage the industrialization of our  products and our ability to manage costs. Customer  acceptance of our products depends on performance of  our products in the field. As our products become more  complex, we face an increasing risk that products that we  develop may not meet development milestones or  specifications and that our products may not perform  according to specifications, including quality standards. If  our products do not perform according to specifications  and performance criteria or if quality or performance issues  arise, this may result in additional costs, reduced demand  for our products, and our customers being unable to meet  planned wafer capacity. Transitioning our newly developed products to full-scale  production requires the expansion of our infrastructure,  including enhancing our manufacturing capabilities,  increasing supply of components and training qualified  personnel, and may also require our suppliers to expand  their infrastructure capabilities. If we or our suppliers are  unable to expand infrastructure as necessary, we may be  unable to introduce new technologies, products or product  enhancements or reach high-volume production of newly  developed products on a timely basis or at all. New technologies might not have the same margins as  existing technologies and we might not be able to adjust  value-based pricing and or cost in an effective manner. In  addition, the introduction of new technologies, products or  product enhancements also impacts ASML’s liquidity, as  new products may have higher cycle times to produce  resulting in increased working capital needs. This impact  on liquidity increases as our products become more  complex and expensive. The capability, capacity and costs associated with  providing the required customer support function to cover  the increasing number of shipments and servicing a  growing number of EUV systems that are operational in the  field could affect the timing of shipments, and the efficient  execution of maintenance, servicing and upgrades, which  is key to the systems continuing to achieve the required  productivity. All of our manufacturing activities, including subassembly,  final assembly and system testing, take place in cleanroom  facilities in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, in Berlin, Germany,  in Wilton, Connecticut, US and in San Diego and San Jose,  California, US, in Pyeongtaek, South Korea, in Beijing,  China, in Linkou and Tainan, Taiwan. These facilities may  be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including  work stoppages, fire, energy shortages, pandemic  outbreaks such as COVID-19, flooding or other disasters,  natural and otherwise. We cannot ensure that alternative  production capacity would be available if a major  disruption were to occur. As our organization grows, we are not able to fully insure  our risk exposure. In addition, not all disasters are  insurable. As we are unable to duly insure against potential  losses, we are subject to the financial impact of uninsured  losses, which can have an adverse impact on our financial  condition and results of operation. Hazardous substances are used in the production and  operation of our products and systems, which subjects us  to a variety of governmental regulations relating to  environmental protection, and employee and product  health and safety, including the transport, use, storage,  discharge, handling, emission, generation, and disposal of  toxic or other hazardous substances. In addition, operating  our systems (which use lasers and other potentially  hazardous systems) can be dangerous and can result in  injury. The failure to comply with current or future  regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed  on us, suspension of production, alteration of our  manufacturing and assembly and test processes, damage  to our reputation, and/or restrictions on our operations or  sale or other adverse consequences. Additionally, our  products have become increasingly complex. The  increasing complexity requires us to invest in continued  risk assessments and development of appropriate  preventative and protective measures for health and safety  for both our employees (in connection with the production  and installation of our systems and field options and  performance of our services) and our customers’  employees (in connection with the operation of our  systems). Our health and safety practices may not be  effective in mitigating all health and safety risks, including  such risks resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Failing  to comply with applicable regulations or the failure of our  implemented practices for customer and employee health  and safety could subject us to significant liabilities. We rely on the accuracy, availability and security of our  information technology systems. Despite the measures  that we have implemented, including those related to  cybersecurity, our systems could be breached or damaged  by computer viruses and systems attacks, natural or man- made incidents, disasters or unauthorized physical or  electronic access. We are experiencing an increasing number of cyberattacks  on our information technology systems as well as the  information technology systems of our suppliers,  customers and other service providers, whose systems we  do not control. These attacks include malicious software  (malware), attempts to gain unauthorized access to data,  and other electronic security breaches of our information  technology systems. They also include the information  technology systems of our suppliers, customers and other  service providers that have led and could lead, for us, our  customers, suppliers or other business partners - including  R&D partners - to disruptions in critical systems,  unauthorized release, misappropriation, corruption or loss  of data or confidential information (including confidential  information relating to our customers, employees and  suppliers). In addition, any system failure, accident or security breach  could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual  property, trade secrets (including our proprietary  technology), unauthorized access to, or disclosure of,  customer, personnel, supplier or other confidential  information, corruption of our data or of our systems,  reputational damage or litigation. Furthermore, computer  viruses or other malware may harm our systems and  software and could be inadvertently transmitted to our  customers' systems and operations, which could result in  loss of customers or litigation. We may also be required to  incur significant costs to protect against or repair the  damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches  in the future, including, for example, rebuilding internal  systems, implementing additional threat protection  measures, providing modifications to our products and  services, defending against litigation, responding to  regulatory inquiries or actions, paying damages, or taking  other remedial steps with respect to third parties. These cybersecurity threats are constantly evolving. We,  therefore, remain potentially vulnerable to additional known  or yet unknown threats, as in some instances, we, our  customers, and our suppliers may be unaware of an  incident or its magnitude and effects. We also face the risk  that we expose our customers to cybersecurity attacks  through the systems we deliver to our customers, including  in the form of malware or other types of attacks as  described above, which could harm our customers.  Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the  level of remote working within our organization, which  increases the risks of cybersecurity incidents. In addition, from time to time, we implement updates to our  information technology systems and software, which can  disrupt or shutdown our information technology systems.  We may not be able to successfully launch and integrate In recent years, our business has grown significantly in  terms of sales, operations, employees and our business  infrastructure. As a result, the complexity of complying with  rules and regulations has increased. Furthermore, as we  have expanded our business in countries where we did not  previously operate, we have become increasingly subject  to compliance with additional rules and regulations in such  jurisdictions, including anti-corruption, anti-bribery and  human rights standards, which can be complex. We are  also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by  authorities in such jurisdictions regarding compliance with  rules and regulations, including tax laws. Furthermore, the existing rules and regulations that we are  subject to, including regulations relating to trade, national  security, tax, exchange controls, reporting, anti-corruption  laws, data protection, are becoming more complex and the  trade and national security environment has resulted in  increasing restrictions. We also face the risk that trade and  security regulations could limit our ability to sell our  products and services in certain jurisdictions. Such changes in the regulation that applies to our business  can increase compliance costs and the risk of non- compliance. Noncompliance can result in fines and  penalties and regulation could impact our ability to sell our  products and services. We are subject to income taxes in the Netherlands and  numerous other jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate has  fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future. Changes in tax legislation in the countries where we  operate can affect our effective tax rate. For example, in  past years the OECD has implemented measures against  so-called Base Erosion and Profit Shifting or BEPS and is  currently working on additional proposals to avoid tax  evasion and enhance tax transparency. Based on the  BEPS reports the EU has proposed directives to counter  base erosion and profit shifting which in turn have resulted  in legislative proposals in EU member states. Similar  legislative initiatives inspired by the BEPS reports have  been taken in Asian jurisdictions in which we operate.  These initiatives have resulted in increased compliance  requirements for ASML. In September 2020, the previously proposed reduction in  the general Dutch corporate income tax rate was reversed.  Furthermore, an increase from 7% to 9% as of 2021 to the  favorable Dutch corporate income tax rate for innovation  was adopted. We continuously monitor and assess the  impact of developments in tax legislation on ASML.   these new systems as planned without disruption to our  operations. For example, we are currently implementing a  new ERP system and infrastructure (ONE program). As a  result of this system implementation or otherwise, have  and could continue to experience disruptions in our  operations. Changes to tax legislation of jurisdictions we operate in,  may adversely impact our tax position and consequently  our net income. Our worldwide effective tax rate is heavily  impacted by R&D incentives included in tax laws and  regulations in the countries we operate in. An example is  the so-called innovation box tax legislation in the  Netherlands (mentioned above). In case jurisdictions alter  their tax policies in this respect, this may have an adverse  effect on our worldwide effective tax rate. In addition,  jurisdictions levy corporate income tax at different rates.  The mix of our sales over the various jurisdictions in which  we operate may vary from year to year, resulting in a  different mix of corporate income tax rates applicable to  our profits, which can affect our worldwide effective tax  rate and adversely impact our net income. Other risk factors The COVID-19 pandemic may impact our operations The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented  to address this pandemic globally continue to impact our  business and our suppliers and customers. The pandemic  has already had a significant impact on the global  economy, which can potentially impact our end markets.  There is significant uncertainty about how the current  COVID-19 pandemic will impact global GDP development,  end markets, our manufacturing capability and supply  chain, and the longer this pandemic lasts the greater are  the risks. The full impact of this pandemic on ASML will  depend on future developments, including continued  severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the actions to  contain the outbreak or address its impact which are  outside of our control. Restrictions on shareholder rights may dilute voting  power Our Articles of Association provide that we are subject to  the provisions of Dutch law applicable to large  corporations, called 'structuurregime'. These provisions  have the effect of concentrating control over certain  corporate decisions and transactions in the hands of our  Supervisory Board. As a result, holders of ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the  face of actions by members of our Supervisory Board than  if we were incorporated in the US or another jurisdiction. Our authorized share capital also includes a class of  cumulative preference shares and we have granted  Stichting Preferente Aandelen ASML, a Dutch foundation,  an option to acquire, at their nominal value of €0.09 per  share, such cumulative preference shares. Exercise of the  Preference Share Option would effectively dilute the voting  power of our outstanding ordinary shares by one-half,  which may discourage or significantly impede a third party  from acquiring a majority of our voting shares. See Leadership and governance - Corporate governance -  Board of Management and Supervisory Board, and  Consolidated Financial Statements - Notes to the  Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 22 Shareholders’  equity. We may not declare cash dividends and conduct share  buyback programs at all or in any particular amounts in  any given year  We aim to pay a semi-annual dividend that is growing (on  an annualized basis) over time, and we conduct share  buyback programs from time to time. The dividend  proposal and amount of share buybacks in any given year  will be subject to the availability of distributable profits,  retained earnings and cash, and may be affected by,  among other factors, the Board of Management’s views on  our potential future liquidity requirements, including for  investments in production capacity and working capital  requirements, the funding of our R&D programs and for  acquisition opportunities that may arise from time to time,  and by future changes in applicable income tax and  corporate laws. We may also suspend buyback programs  from time to time, which would reduce the amount of cash  we are able to return to shareholders. Accordingly, the  Board of Management may decide to propose not to pay a  dividend or pay a lower dividend and may suspend, adjust  the amount of or discontinue share buyback programs or  we may otherwise fail to complete buyback programs. We are a global leader in the semiconductor  industry. As the innovator that makes vital  systems for the chip industry, we have a  responsibility to lead by example. Our purpose  is clear, ‘to unlock the potential of people and  society by pushing technology to new limits’,  and we want our values to reflect in everything  we do to pursue our purpose. Anywhere we  operate, we believe that conducting our  business with honesty and acting with the  highest standards of integrity is essential to our  value creation for our stakeholder groups, and  the long-term success of our company. We are committed to conducting our business in  compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all the  countries we operate in. We promote and uphold ethical  behavior, fostering a culture where speaking up is  encouraged and appreciated. Guided by feedback from employees on ASML’s first-ever  Global Ethics Survey in 2019, we took the opportunity in  2020 to improve our ethics organization. Among other  activities, we set out to grow and professionalize our  network of Ethics Liaisons, highlight the role of the Ethics  Office, revise the Code of Conduct to align more clearly  with ASML’s values, and raise awareness around how the  company responds to questions related to ethics. Business ethics and Code of  Conduct We live our values – Challenge, Collaborate and Care – a  shared belief system at ASML that defines who we are.  These values are reflected in our Code of Conduct. It sets  clear expectations and guiding principles on the way we  conduct our business and serves to foster a culture of  integrity, ethics and respect. Together with a set of practical  guidelines, it helps our employees make smart decisions  that will benefit all stakeholders and puts integrity at the  center of what we do. ASML relies heavily on the skills, commitment and behavior  of its employees for its continued success as a company,  and for its positive contribution to society. That’s why we  expect all employees to fully live up to the company’s  values and to act with integrity and respect at all times. We  ask all our employees to acknowledge our Code, and we  expect our business partners to respect our Code. As a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA),  we have adopted the RBA Code of Conduct, which is a  common set of social, environmental and ethical industry  standards. Our Code is in line with the RBA Code of  Conduct. To reinforce our commitment to the supplier  network, we expect our key suppliers (representing around  80% of our total spend) and their suppliers to comply with  the RBA Code of Conduct and to develop their own  strategies, policies and processes to follow it. This  requirement is included in our long-term product-related  suppliers’ contracts. For more information, see What we  achieved in 2020 - Our supply chain. Our Ethics Board, chaired by our CEO and reporting  to the Board of Management, is responsible for  policymaking and the supervision of ASML’s compliance  with legal and ethical requirements. The Ethics Board  meets regularly to give guidance on relevant issues. Our Ethics Committee investigates significant  notifications about potential breaches of ASML's Code  of Conduct worldwide. Our Ethics Office is responsible for overseeing  and implementing our Ethics program. All reports of  a possible breach of ASML's Code of Conduct are  screened by one of the Ethics Officers and all significant  reports are discussed with the Ethics Committee. Our ethics organization includes employees who, in  addition to their regular roles at ASML, act as Ethics  Liaisons in all the countries we operate in. They serve as  trusted representatives, and act as the first local point  of contact for employees with questions and concerns  related to ethics. Our Code of Conduct is available on our website (www.asml.com), our intranet and in our Employee app. Promoting ethical behavior We provide a dedicated Ethics Program, which offers the  necessary support, advice, training and communication to  enable employees and others to understand and follow our  Code. It does this by building awareness through various  communication channels to foster a culture of integrity. It  also helps create an open and honest culture where the  instinct to do the right thing, and to comply with the law  and ASML policies, is embedded across the organization. Fostering a culture of integrity starts with management  setting the right example. To support managers to be  leaders who act with integrity, we’ve developed a practical  handbook with guidelines, tips about dealing with specific  situations, and tools they can use in daily operations. In every location where we operate, we have Ethics  Liaisons. They serve as trusted representatives and act as  the first local point of contact for employees with questions  and concerns related to ethics. They support management  in managing ethical risks, and employees can go to them  to speak up in good faith. In 2020, we developed a new ethics training curriculum,  which introduces and raises awareness about the Code  and related topics in an interactive and inspiring way. The  curriculum includes five modules for all employees, and a  separate module for managers that needs to be completed  over a period of two years. The modules cover our Code  and other compliance-related topics, and raise awareness  around the importance of ethical behavior and our Speak  Up policy. It also provides information and guidance on  dealing with topics such as personal relationships at work,  conflicts of interest, navigating cultural differences, and We protect our assets ASML’s most valuable assets are its people and knowledge, both of which are highly valued and  protected. Our ‘assets’ include intellectual property (IP), which refers to intangible assets such as  technical know-how, products data, business data, and personal data, as well as physical assets such  as products, tooling, funds and computers for conducting ASML business. Our company expects  anyone entrusted with ASML assets to keep them safe from loss, damage, misuse or theft. We respect people ASML is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy working environment, respecting human  rights in line with international laws and regulations and industry standards such as the RBA Code of  Conduct. Diversity of cultures, education and talent makes us a stronger, more creative and innovative  company. By working together and using these values to guide us, we create an environment based  on mutual respect – one that leads to better results than any of us can achieve alone. A strong culture of integrity and compliance underpins ASML’s business success. We define ‘integrity’  as acting with honesty, sincerity, care and reliability. Compliance not only means complying with laws  and regulations, but also with our high ethical standards. Our reputation for integrity is a valuable  asset. It is essential for us to demonstrate personal and business integrity at all times. Technology reaches all parts of society. By helping to make chips more affordable and more  powerful, ASML has an important role to play – not only by reputation and results but in relation to  the environment too. This is why ASML is committed to conducting business responsibly, enabling  sustainable growth while fulfilling legal and moral obligations. We aim to achieve our business  objectives in a caring and responsible manner as outlined in the key principles. To fulfill our commitment to upholding the high standards of integrity described in this Code,  communication is key. We strive for a working environment that encourages open dialogue among  employees, as well as between employees and third parties, where employees feel comfortable  and respected, and that they can trust each other to do the right thing. If you observe or suspect a  violation, we encourage you to speak up. ethical aspects around ancillary activities or other positions  outside of ASML. The Ethics Program includes our annual Ethics Awareness  Week, where we address a specific theme around ethics.  In 2020, due to the volume of new information we wanted  to share with employees, we expanded the week-long  event, running a series of activities over the whole of  November. At this time, we launched the new Code and  the updated training curriculum. The refreshed online training goes to all new employees  within the first three months of starting at ASML. The first  module covers the Code, and this will be followed by other  modules addressing different topics, as well as those  connected to the Code, over the next two years. We also expanded our network of Ethics Liaisons globally  in 2020 (up to 55 from 42 in 2019), ensuring even more  global coverage. We also increased the number of areas  Ethics Liaisons come from, so encouraging people from all  over the business to become involved and increasing  diversity in this area. Our liaisons were especially important during the  COVID-19 pandemic when travel was not possible. We  relied on them to keep channels of communication open  and to help us better understand the types of issues our  employees were facing across the globe. This, and growing  our capability in terms of Ethics Investigators – the people  looking into the most serious kinds of ethics complaints –  are just two of the ways we have been professionalizing the  Ethics Office. Encouraging people to speak up  We encourage everyone, including external business  partners, such as suppliers, contractors and other workers,  to express, in good faith, any concerns they might have  regarding possible violations of our Code, our company’s  policies, or the law. Our Speak Up policy, which includes our Whistleblower  policy and our Ethics Investigation procedure, outlines the  steps employees are encouraged to take if they experience  or suspect a breach of our business ethics. These policies  and procedure reassure employees that they can report a  breach without fear of repercussions. For employees or  external stakeholders who prefer to remain anonymous, we  have a Speak Up system available to report breaches  anonymously. This is run by an independent, external  service company. We look into all Speak Up messages. The role of the Ethics  Office is to assess each Speak Up message, and bring it to  the attention of the relevant employee, team or committee,  so that remediation actions can be taken by the  appropriate body. We group Speak Up messages in three categories:  questions, concerns and complaints. With regard to  concerns and complaints, this could include a shortfall in a  procedure or a policy that is possibly not being applied as  it should be or has been misinterpreted. We discuss the  issue with the policy owner or those working in the  particular area as to how it could be better handled or  improved. A complaint is the most serious type of case the  Ethics Office deals with. To be categorized as a complaint,  there must be an alleged breach or a violation of the Code,  which cannot be resolved by line managers or HR. If we reach the stage where an allegation remains beyond  this point, it is referred to our Ethics Committee, which  investigates significant cases of potential breaches of  ASML's Code worldwide. We have established an  Investigation Procedure policy, which describes the steps  to be followed in the event of an investigation into an ethics  complaint. This ensures ethics complaints are dealt with  fairly, independently, and in an impartial and unbiased  manner as set out in ASML’s Speak Up policy. The  investigation procedure has three phases – an initial review  phase, a fact-finding and assessment phase, and a  decision phase. The aim is to bring closure within two  months, and, once a decision is made, we are committed  to implementing an appropriate remedy. We registered 229 Speak Up messages from employees in  2020. As in previous years, many of these related to issues  resulting from cultural differences, leading to discrimination,  and challenges with the style and language of  communication between employees. Other messages  concerned issues such as alleged bullying and conflicts of  interest, including, for example, if employees are allowed to  accept gifts from customers. We have looked into and  addressed all Speak Up messages. As in previous years, we did not incur any fines for  breaches of ethical regulations. Anti-bribery and anti-corruption The role of our Legal Compliance function is to make sure  we conduct business in compliance with all relevant  national and international laws and regulations, as well as  professional standards, accepted business practices and  our own internal standards. Our Legal Compliance function oversees adherence to a  wide variety of regulatory compliance-related areas and  advises management about the regulatory framework,  including changes in legislation and regulations. Examples  of such regulatory compliance areas are our securities and  insider trading, competition law (antitrust), and anti-bribery  and anti-corruption. When needed, Legal Compliance  takes charge of any regulatory investigations. We are committed to personal and business integrity and  avoiding improper influence on others or ourselves. In  2020, we have updated our Anti-bribery and anti- corruption policy. Our Anti-bribery and anti-corruption  policy details our commitment and the measures we take  to prevent bribery and corruption at ASML. It also ensures  compliance with applicable laws prohibiting domestic and  foreign bribery and corruption as well as the ASML Code of  Conduct. For more information or download of the policy,  please visit www.asml.com. There were no breaches of our Anti-bribery and anti- corruption policy in the reporting year. Competition Law Compliance policy We are committed to the principles of fair competition and  fairness in dealing with our business partners, including  suppliers, co-developers, customers and other industry  peers. As such, ASML does not condone any form of  conduct that is considered illegal under applicable  competition laws or is contrary to our Code of Conduct. Our Competition Law Compliance policy demonstrates our  ongoing commitment to ensuring compliance with  applicable competition laws and our Code of Conduct. For  more information or download of the policy, please visit  www.asml.com. Privacy protection We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy  rights of employees, customers, suppliers and everyone  we do business with. Personal data is managed in a  professional, lawful and ethical way, in line with our Code  of Conduct and in compliance with applicable laws and  regulations. We have technical and organizational measures in place to  prevent the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,  alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to  personal data. Our Privacy policy sets the minimum  requirements from the perspective of ASML as a global  organization. The policy is binding for all ASML employees  and applies to the processing of personal data of our staff,  job applicants and business partners such as customers,  suppliers, visitors and other individuals. A dedicated privacy and personal data protection program  ensures we adhere to the ASML Privacy policy. Our privacy  program includes, among others, the following elements: • Governance: At the senior management level, the  Corporate Risk Committee is responsible for oversight  of the topic of privacy, while the Privacy Office manages  the privacy framework and provides assistance and  guidance. Each employee is responsible for reading  and understanding the content and implications of the  Privacy policy. • Systems and procedures: The Privacy Controls  framework consist of 130 privacy activities including  privacy impact assessments and data protection  impact assessments. The Privacy Controls framework is  included in our ERM process. • Disciplinary actions: We investigate all  incidents,  concerns and registered reports of potential breaches  that are registered in our Privacy portal as outlined in our  personal data breach procedure. We take appropriate  control measures and disciplinary actions to prevent  reoccurrence. • Audit: Privacy is included in our internal audit program.  Our privacy notices for both business partners and  recruitment are derived from our Privacy policy. They  explain why personal data is collected and how ASML  uses it. In 2020, we updated our Global Privacy Notices for  workers, job applicant, business partners and visitors. The  new privacy notices reflect the latest processing of  personal data within ASML, and meet both the  requirements of GDPR (Europe) and CCPA (US). Respecting human rights We conduct business on the basis of fairness, good faith,  and integrity and we expect the same from all those we  work with. To this end, we also believe that we have the  responsibility to respect human rights and contribute to  positive impact. We are committed to respecting universal human rights  and honoring the value of ethics as expressed in our Code  of Conduct. We support the principles laid down in the  OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, United  Nations Guiding Principles (UNGP) on Business and  Human Rights and those in the International Labor  Organization’s (ILO) Tripartite Declaration of Principles  concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy. We  have established a Human Rights policy, which is publicly  available on www.asml.com. Our Human Rights policy complements our ASML Code of  Conduct and the RBA Code of Conduct we adhere to. It  expresses our commitment to human rights and  responsible labor practice in our operations and our supply  chain. The Human Rights policy applies to ASML and its  subsidiaries anywhere in the world. The overall  responsibility for identifying and managing human rights  issues in our direct operations falls under the remit of our  Executive Vice President HR. Responsibility for human  rights in our supply chain falls under the remit of our  Executive Vice President & Chief Strategy Officer. Our operations In 2019, we conducted a risk assessment to identify the  inherent risks related to human rights within our own  operations. The results of our analysis showed that the  inherent risk of human rights vulnerabilities in ASML's own  operations are working hours and overtime, health and  safety, and workplace harassment. The vulnerable rights- holder groups identified within ASML are contractors,  ethnic minorities and migrant workers. In addition, we also  conduct internal EHS audits regularly. Read more in:  Ensuring employee safety. Working hours and overtime The standard weekly working hours in the locations where  we operate are on average 40 hours. Our company  standards are based on the International Labor Standards  of the International Labor Organization (the Forty-Hour  Week Convention) and the RBA norms. A workweek must  not exceed the maximum set by local law and a workweek  should not be more than 60 hours per week, including  overtime, except in an emergency or unusual situation. We  pay constant attention to protecting our employees from  working overtime during peak periods. As overtime  remains an important attention point for management, we  keep monitoring the use of overtime and take appropriate  measures to manage the situation. Health and safety It is our obligation to provide safe and healthy working  conditions for all our employees and others working on our  premises. In our products and processes, we think about  how to make ASML a safe place to work. We put  significant effort into creating awareness and to have a  proactive safety culture within ASML. Read more in:  Ensuring employee safety. Workplace harassment We are a global company with operations in more than 60  locations in 16 countries. We have a culturally diverse  workforce, employing 120 nationalities. This leads to a  higher inherent risk around the issue of workplace  harassment in human rights. Read more in: Encouraging  people to speak up, Promoting diversity and inclusion.  Through our Ethics Program, we raise awareness around  the importance of ethical behavior and our Speak Up  policy. It also provides information and guidance on dealing  with topics such as personal relationships at work, conflict  of interest, dealing with cultural differences, and ethical  aspects around ancillary activities or other positions  outside of ASML.  company's activities or business relationships. We  assessed possible impacts on people’s human rights  across our value chain. We focused our efforts on seeking  stakeholder input on the one hand and performing due  diligence in relation to our initial salient issues on the other  hand. Our commitments to address and engage actively in  our salient human rights issues are highlighted in our Code  of Conduct, Human Rights policy and RBA Code of  Conduct for suppliers. We identify and manage human  rights issues in various ways, for example stakeholder  engagement, internal human rights assessment in our  operations, and suppliers' due diligence and sustainability  risk management. Read more in: Responsible supply  chain). We received no grievance on breaches on human rights in  2020. Our supply chain We assess risks related to human rights in our supply chain  through a risk-based approach. In our due diligence  process, we use the RBA Risk Assessment Platform to  identify inherent risks in labor (including human rights),  ethics, health & safety and  environmental standards  across our full supply base. In the event of a medium or  high risk relating to labor being identified, we engage with  the supplier and conduct a more detailed analysis. For  strategic suppliers covering around 80% of our product- related spend, we expect them to complete the annual  RBA SAQ. This SAQ covers more than 400 risk elements  related to labor (including human rights), ethics, environmental and safety factors, control elements and  management systems, including their performance. It helps  us to determine a supplier’s risk profile on sustainability.  When we identify compliance gaps, we engage with the  supplier to determine corrective action plan(s). The salient issues we have defined relate to working  conditions (forced and bonded labor), health and safety,  and trade union rights. However, operating in the high-tech  industry the majority of our suppliers operate in countries  with a strong rule of law and are law abiding. We view this  inherent risk as low. Read more in: Responsible supply  chain. We endorse the importance of good corporate  governance, of which independence,  accountability and transparency are the most  significant elements. These are also the  elements on which a relationship of trust  between us and our stakeholders can be built. ASML Holding N.V. is a public limited liability company  operating under Dutch law. ASML’s shares are listed on  Euronext Amsterdam and NASDAQ. We have a two-tier board structure, consisting of a Board  of Management responsible for managing the company,  and an independent Supervisory Board which supervises  and advises the Board of Management. For the fulfillment  of their duties, the two Boards are accountable to the  General Meeting, the corporate body representing our  shareholders.  Our governance structure is based on ASML’s articles of  association, Dutch corporate and securities laws and the  Dutch Corporate Governance Code. Because we are listed  on NASDAQ, we are also required to comply with the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the NASDAQ Listing Rules, and the  rules and regulations promulgated by the US Securities  and Exchange Committee. Board of Management ASML’s Board of Management is responsible for managing  ASML. Its responsibilities include establishing a position on  the relevance of long-term value creation for ASML and its  business, defining and deploying ASML’s strategy,  establishing and maintaining effective risk management  and control systems, managing the realization of ASML’s  operational and financial objectives and the corporate  social responsibility aspects relevant to ASML. In fulfilling  its management tasks and responsibilities, the Board of  Management is guided by the interests of ASML and its  business and takes into consideration the interests of our  stakeholders. The current Board of Management is comprised of six  members. It has a dual leadership structure, under the  chairmanship of the President and CEO, and the vice  chairmanship of the President and Chief Technology Officer. The Board of Management has adopted a division  of tasks, charging individual members with a specific part  of the managerial tasks, but the Board of Management  remains collectively responsible for the management of  ASML. The Board of Management is supervised and advised by  the Supervisory Board. The Board of Management  provides the Supervisory Board with all the information, in  writing or otherwise, necessary for the Supervisory Board  to properly carry out its duties. Besides the information  provided in the regular meetings, the Board of  Management provides the Supervisory Board with regular  updates on developments relating to our business,  financials, operations, and industry developments in  general. Certain important decisions of the Board of  Management require the approval of the Supervisory  Board, see the Supervisory Board section of this Corporate  Governance chapter. This section of the report addresses our corporate  governance structure and the way ASML applies the  principles and best practices of the Dutch Corporate  Governance Code. It also provides information required by  the Decree adopting further rules related to the content of  the management report and the Decree implementing  Article 10 of the Takeover Directive. In accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code  (https://www.mccg.nl/english), other parts of this Annual  Report address our strategy and culture aimed at long- term value creation, our values and Code of Conduct, as  well as the main features of our internal control and risk  management systems. See the Our strategy, How we  create value, Our company and How we manage  risk sections in this annual report. We are subject to the relevant provisions of Dutch law  applicable to large corporations (structuurregime). These  provisions have the effect of concentrating control over  certain corporate decisions and transactions in the hands  of the Supervisory Board. Procedures for the appointment  and dismissal of Board of management and Supervisory  Board members are based on the structuurregime. Further information regarding the general responsibilities of  the Board of Management, the relationship with the  Supervisory Board and various stakeholders, the decision- making process within the Board of Management, and the  logistics surrounding the meetings can be found in the  Board of Management’s rules of procedure. These are  published in the Governance section on our website.  Appointments  Members of the Board of Management are appointed by  the Supervisory Board on the recommendation of the  Selection and Nomination Committee and upon notification  to the General Meeting. Members of the Board of  Management are appointed for a term of four years.  Reappointment for consecutive four-year terms is possible. Since 2013, the relationship between a member of the  Board of Management and a listed company can no longer  qualify as an employment relationship.

The agreements between ASML and the Board of  Management members contain specific provisions  regarding severance payments. If ASML terminates the  agreement for reasons which are not exclusively or mainly  found in acts or omissions of the Board of Management  member, a severance payment not exceeding one year’s  base salary will be paid. Furthermore, current agreements  stipulate that a member of the Board of Management,  when giving notice of termination pursuant to a change of  control, will be entitled to a severance amount. Given that  such a resignation is specifically linked to a change of  control, ASML does not consider this provision a deviation  from the Code.

Supervisory Board Our Supervisory Board supervises the Board of  Management and the general course of affairs of ASML  and its subsidiaries. The Supervisory Board also supports  the Board of Management with advice. In fulfilling its role  and responsibilities, the Supervisory Board takes into  consideration the interests of ASML and its subsidiaries, as  well as the relevant interests of its stakeholders. In the two- tier structure, the Supervisory Board is a separate and  independent body from the Board of Management and  from ASML. No member of the Supervisory Board  personally maintains a business relationship with ASML,  other than as a member of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board currently consists of nine members,  with the minimum being three. In performing its task, the Supervisory Board focuses on,  inter alia, ASML’s corporate strategy aimed at long-term  value creation and the execution thereof, the staffing of and  succession planning for the Board of management, the  management of risks inherent to its business activities, the  financial reporting process, compliance with applicable  legislation and regulations, ASML’s culture and the  activities of the Board of Management in that regard,  the  relationship with shareholders and other stakeholders, and  corporate social responsibility issues important for ASML. Important management decisions, such as setting the  operational and financial objectives, the strategy designed  to achieve these objectives and the parameters to be  applied in relation thereto, major investments, budget and  the issue, repurchase and cancellation of shares, require  the Supervisory Board’s approval. The Supervisory Board is governed by its rules of  procedure. Items covered in these rules include the  responsibilities of the Supervisory Board and its  committees, the composition of the Supervisory Board and  its committees, logistics surrounding the meetings, the  meeting attendance of members of the Supervisory Board,  the rotation schedule for these members and the  Committee charters. The Supervisory Board’s rules of  procedure and the committee charters are regularly  reviewed and, if needed, amended. The Audit Committee  charter is reviewed annually to check whether the charter  still complies with the applicable rules and regulations,  especially those relating to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For detailed information on the meetings and activities of  the Supervisory Board in 2020, see Leadership and  governance - Supervisory Board report - Meetings and  attendance. Appointments The members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by  the General Meeting based on binding nominations  proposed by the Supervisory Board. When nominating  persons for (re)appointment, the Supervisory Board checks  whether the candidates fit the Supervisory Board's profile.  The profile is available in the Governance section of our  website. The General Meeting may reject binding  nominations of the Supervisory Board by way of a  resolution adopted with an absolute majority of the votes  cast, representing at least one-third of ASML’s outstanding  share capital. If the votes cast in favor of such a resolution  do not represent at least one-third of the total outstanding  capital, a new shareholders’ meeting can be convened, at  which the nomination can be overruled by an absolute  majority. The Supervisory Board generally informs the General  Meeting and the Works Council about upcoming  retirements by rotation at the Annual General Meeting of  Shareholders (AGM) in the year preceding the actual  retirement(s) by rotation. This ensures they have sufficient  opportunity to recommend candidates for the upcoming  vacancies. The Supervisory Board has the right to reject  the proposed recommendations. Furthermore, the Works  Council has an enhanced right to make recommendations  for one-third of the members of the Supervisory Board.  This enhanced recommendation right implies that the  Supervisory Board may only reject the Works Council’s  recommendations in limited circumstances: (i) if the  relevant person is unsuitable or (ii) if the Supervisory Board  would not be duly composed if the recommended person  were appointed as Supervisory Board member. Members of the Supervisory Board serve for a maximum  term of four years or a shorter period as per the  Supervisory Board’s rotation schedule. Supervisory Board  members are eligible for reappointment for another  maximum term of four years. After that, members may be  reappointed again for a maximum period of two years. This  appointment may be extended for a final term of no more  than two years. The rotation schedule is available in the  Governance section on our website. If the General Meeting loses confidence in the Supervisory  Board, it may, by an absolute majority of the votes  representing at least one-third of the total outstanding  capital, withdraw its confidence in the Supervisory Board.  This resolution shall result in the immediate dismissal of the  entire Supervisory Board. In such case, the Enterprise  Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal shall appoint  one or more members to the Supervisory Board at the  request of the Board of Management.  Supervisory Board committees The Supervisory Board, while retaining overall  responsibility, has assigned some of its tasks and  responsibilities to four committees: the Audit Committee,  the Remuneration Committee, the Selection and  Nomination Committee and the Technology Committee.

The  current Remuneration Policy was adopted by the General  Meeting in 2020. The remuneration of the Supervisory Board is based on the  Remuneration Policy adopted by the General Meeting. The   current Remuneration Policy was adopted by the General  meeting in 2020. The remuneration of the Supervisory  Board is not dependent on our (financial) results.

Diversity Until January 1, 2020, Dutch legislation provided for  statutory provisions to ensure a balanced representation of  men and women on the management boards and  supervisory boards of companies governed by this  legislation. Balanced representation of men and women  was deemed to exist if at least 30% of the seats were filled  by men and at least 30% were filled by women. Within the  meaning of this legislation, our Supervisory Board currently  qualifies as balanced. No seats are taken by women on the  Board of Management, which, as a result, would not qualify  as balanced. Currently, new Dutch legislation is being  prepared aimed at improving gender diversity in listed  companies, among others by imposing a quota of at least  one-third for both women and men on supervisory boards.  We are closely monitoring developments in this area. We recognize the importance of diversity and inclusion: a  diverse and inclusive workforce provides the necessary  mix of voices and points of view required to continue to  innovate and drive our business forward. Ensuring  balanced gender representation has proven to be  challenging in a technology environment such as the one  ASML operates in. Historically, there is a lower ratio of  women compared to men in technology and science- related studies and the labor market in STEM (science,  technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields. We run  an intensive technology promotion program aimed at  getting women more interested in a career in science,  engineering and technology, and at the same time  increasing our future talent pool, so that more women will  be available in the future for technical positions and (senior)  management positions, including the Board of  Management. Given the specific nature of our industry, this  is a challenging and long-term process. In 2020, we started the development of a detailed Diversity  & Inclusion strategy and action plan for the company, to  further enhance gender diversity as well as other  dimensions of diversity. In 2020, we made progress in gender diversity among all  employees and senior management. Female employees  now make up 17% of our workforce worldwide, having  gradually moved up from 10% in 2010. The percentage of  women in senior management positions increased from  9.6% in 2019 to 10.5% in 2020  to include greater gender  diversity. Yet we still have work to do in this area.  For more  information on our diversity and inclusion initiatives and  performance data, see What we achieved in 2020 - Our  people - Promoting diversity and inclusion and Non- financial statements - Non-financial indicators - Our  people. Conflict of interest Conflicts of interest procedures are incorporated in both  the Board of Management’s and the Supervisory Board’s  rules of procedure. These procedures reflect Dutch law and  the principles and best practice provisions of the Code  with respect to conflicts of interest.  There have been no transactions in 2020, nor are there  currently any transactions, between ASML or any of  ASML’s subsidiaries, or any significant shareholder and any  member of the Board of Management, officer, Supervisory  Board member or any relative or spouse thereof, other than  ordinary course compensation arrangements. Outside positions Pursuant to Dutch legislation, a member of the Board of  Management may not be a Supervisory Board member in  more than two other large companies or large foundations,  as defined in Dutch law. A member of the Board of  Management may never be the Chair of a Supervisory  Board of a large company. Board of Management  members require prior approval from the Supervisory  Board before accepting of another large company or  foundation. Members of the Board of Management are also  required to notify the Supervisory Board of other important  functions held or to be held by them. Dutch law stipulates that a supervisory board member may  not hold more than five Supervisory Board positions in  large companies or large foundations as defined in Dutch  law, with chairmanships counting double. During the financial year 2020 all members of the Board of  Management and the Supervisory Board complied with the  requirements described above. Shareholders and General Meeting A General Meeting is held at least once a year and  generally takes place in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. The  agenda for the AGM typically includes the following topics: • Discussion of the management report and the adoption  of the financial statements over the past financial year; • Discussion of the dividend policy and approval of any  proposed dividends; • Advisory vote on the Remuneration Report over the past  financial year; • The discharge from liability of the members of the  Board of Management and the Supervisory Board for  the performance of their responsibilities in the previous  financial year; • The limited authorization for the Board of Management  to issue (rights to) shares in ASML’s capital, and to  exclude preemptive rights for such issuances, as well as  to repurchase shares and to cancel shares • Any other topics proposed by the Board of  Management, the Supervisory Board or shareholders  in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of  association. Proposals placed on the agenda by the Supervisory Board,  the Board of Management, or by shareholders, provided  that they have submitted the proposals in accordance with  the applicable legal provisions, are discussed and resolved  upon. Shareholders representing at least 1.0% of ASML’s  outstanding share capital or representing a share value of  at least €50 million are entitled to place items on the  agenda of a General Meeting at the latest 60 days before  the date of the meeting. Extraordinary general meetings may be held when  considered necessary by the Supervisory Board or Board  of Management. In addition, an extraordinary general  meeting must be held if one or more ordinary or cumulative  preference shareholders, who jointly represent at least 10% Resolutions are adopted by the General Meetings by an  absolute majority of the votes cast (except where a  different proportion of votes are required by the Articles of  Association or Dutch law), and there are generally no  quorum requirements applicable to such meetings. Voting results from the AGM will be made available on our  website within 15 days of the meeting. The draft minutes of  the AGM are available on our website or on request no  later than three months after the meeting. Shareholders  have the opportunity to provide comments in the  subsequent three months, after which the minutes are  adopted by the Chairman and the Secretary of the  meeting. The adopted minutes are also available on our  website and on request. of the issued share capital, make a written request to that  effect to the Supervisory Board and the Board of  Management. The request must specify in detail the  business to be dealt with. Shareholders’ meetings are convened by public  announcement via the website of ASML no later than 42  days prior to the meeting, as stipulated by Dutch law. The  record date is set at the 28th day prior to the day of the  AGM. Persons who are registered as shareholders on the  record date are entitled to attend the meeting and to  exercise other shareholder rights. The Board of Management and Supervisory Board provide  the shareholders with the information relevant to the topics  on the agenda by means of an explanation to the agenda  and other documents necessary or helpful for this purpose.  The agenda indicates which agenda items are voting items,  and which items are for discussion only. All documents  related to the General Meeting, including the agenda with  explanations, are posted on our website. ASML shareholders may appoint a proxy who can vote on  their behalf at the AGM. We also use an internet proxy  voting system, facilitating shareholder participation without  having to attend in person. We also provide the option for  shareholders to issue voting proxies or voting instructions  to an independent civil law notary prior to the AGM. We do  not solicit from or nominate proxies for our shareholders. In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, we organized a hybrid  AGM in 2020, accommodating virtual attendance of the  AGM by enabling shareholders to follow the proceedings of  the meeting via webcast and to vote electronically during  the meeting. This opportunity to participate in the AGM  virtually was offered in addition to the existing possibilities  of attending and voting in person or voting in advance  via written or electronic proxy. As we highly value the  interaction with our shareholders, we invited shareholders  to submit questions about the agenda items prior to the  AGM and, in view of the unprecedented nature of the 2020  AGM, we also decided that follow-up questions in response  to the answers received, could be asked via the virtual  meeting platform. We received a total of 19 questions,  which were all answered during the AGM. ASML's authorized share capital amounts to €126.0 million and is divided into: 77,733,738 ordinary shares were held by 288 registered  holders with a registered address in the US. Since certain  of our ordinary shares were held by brokers and nominees,  the number of record holders in the US may not be  representative of the number of beneficial holders, or of  where the beneficial holders are resident. A total of 96,566,077 depository receipts for ordinary  shares were issued at the launch of the CCIP. This number  has since decreased with the sell-down by the relevant  customers following expiry of the lock-up. Each ordinary share consists of 900 fractional shares.  Fractional shares entitle the holder thereof to a fractional  dividend, but do not give entitlement to voting rights. Only  those persons who hold shares directly in the share register  in the Netherlands, held by us at our address at 5504 DR  Veldhoven, de Run 6501, the Netherlands, or in the New  York share register, held by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.,  P.O. Box 64506, St. Paul, MN 55164-0506, United States,  can hold fractional shares. Shareholders who hold ordinary  shares through the deposit system under the Dutch  Securities Bank Giro Transactions Act maintained by the  Dutch central securities depository Euroclear Nederland or  through the Depository Trust Company cannot hold  fractional shares. Powers In addition to the items submitted annually at the AGM, the  General Meeting also has other powers, with due  observance of the statutory provisions. These include  resolving: • to amend the articles of association; • to issue shares if and insofar as the Board of  Management has not been designated by the General  Meeting for this purpose; • to adopt the Remuneration Policies for the members of  the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. (Proposed) amendments of the Articles of Association  require the approval of the Supervisory Board. A quorum  requirement applies for the general meeting at which an  amendment of the Articles of Association is proposed:  more than half of the issued share capital is required to be The issued and fully paid up ordinary shares with a nominal value of €0.09 each were as follows: Year ended December 31 2018 2019 2020 Issued ordinary shares with nominal value of €0.09 421,097,729 419,810,706 416,514,034 Issued ordinary treasury shares with nominal value of €0.09 10,368,038 5,848,998 2,983,454 Total issued ordinary shares with nominal value of €0.09 431,465,767 425,659,704 419,497,488 Type of shares Amount of shares Nominal value Votes per share  Cumulative preference shares 700,000,000 €0.09 per share 9  Ordinary shares 699,999,000 €0.09 per share 9  Ordinary shares B 9,000 €0.01 per share 1 No ordinary shares B and no cumulative preference shares  have been issued. Special voting rights, limitation voting rights and  transfers of shares There are no special voting rights on the issued shares in  our share capital. Certain voting restrictions apply in respect of ordinary  shares issued in connection with the customer co- investment program, which ASML entered into in 2012 with  three key customers – Intel, TSMC and Samsung – to  accelerate ASML’s development of EUV. Under this  program, the participating customers funded certain  development programs and invested in ASML’s ordinary  shares. Currently, only one participating customer still  holds (directly or indirectly) ordinary shares. The voting  restrictions in respect of these ordinary shares are set out  in the underlying agreement between ASML and the  relevant customer. There are currently no limitations, either under Dutch law or  in ASML’s Articles of Association, on the transfer of  ordinary shares in the share capital of ASML. Pursuant to  ASML’s Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board’s  approval shall be required for every transfer of cumulative  preference shares. represented; the proposal requires a voting majority of at  least three-fourths of the votes cast. If the quorum  requirement is not met, a subsequent general meeting shall  be convened, to be held within four weeks of the first  meeting. At this second meeting, the resolution can be  adopted with at least three-fourths of the votes cast,  irrespective of the share capital represented. If a resolution  to amend the Articles of Association is proposed by the  Board of Management, the resolution will be adopted with  an absolute majority of votes cast irrespective of the  represented share capital at the General Meeting. A brief summary of the most significant provisions of our  Articles of Association is included as Exhibit 99.1 to our  form 6-K furnished to the SEC on February 8, 2013 (the  ‘Articles of Association’), which is incorporated by  reference herein. Issue and repurchase of (rights to) shares Our Board of Management has the power to issue ordinary  shares and cumulative preference shares insofar as it has  been authorized to do so by the General Meeting. The  Board of Management requires approval of the Supervisory  Board for such an issue. The authorization by the General  Meeting can only be granted for a certain period not  exceeding five years and may be extended for no longer  than five years on each occasion. If the General Meeting  has not authorized the Board of Management to issue  shares, the General Meeting will be authorized to issue  shares on the Board of Management’s proposal, provided  that the Supervisory Board has approved such proposal. Holders of ASML’s ordinary shares have a preemptive right,  in proportion to the aggregate nominal amount of the  ordinary shares held by them. This preemptive right may be  restricted or excluded. Holders of ordinary shares do not  have preemptive right with respect to any ordinary shares  issued for consideration other than cash or ordinary shares  issued to employees. If authorized for this purpose by the  General Meeting, the Board of Management has the power,  subject to approval of the Supervisory Board, to restrict or  exclude the preemptive rights of holders of ordinary shares. We may repurchase our issued ordinary shares at any time,  subject to compliance with the requirements of Dutch law  and our Articles of Association. Any such repurchases are  subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and the  authorization by the General Meeting, which authorization  may not be for more than 18 months. For details on our share buyback program, see the  Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 22 Shareholders’  equity. At our 2020 AGM, the Board of Management was  authorized from April 22, 2020 through October 22, 2021,  subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to  issue shares and / or rights thereto representing up to a  maximum of 5% of our issued share capital at April 22,  2020, plus an additional 5% of our issued share capital  at April 22, 2020 that may be issued in connection with  mergers, acquisitions and / or (strategic) alliances. Our  shareholders also authorized the Board of Management  through October 22, 2021, subject to approval of the  Supervisory Board, to restrict or exclude preemptive rights  with respect to holders of ordinary shares up to a maximum  of 10% of our issued share capital. At the 2020 AGM, the Board of Management was  authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to  repurchase through October 22, 2021, up to a maximum of  two times 10% of our issued share capital at April 22, 2020,  at a price between the nominal value of the ordinary shares  purchased and 110% of the market price of these securities  on Euronext Amsterdam or NASDAQ. ASML Preference Shares Foundation  The ASML Preference Shares Foundation (Stichting  Preferente Aandelen ASML), a foundation organized under  Dutch law, has been granted an option right to acquire  preference shares in the share capital of ASML. The  Foundation may exercise the Preference Share Option in  situations where, in the opinion of the Foundation’s Board  of Directors, ASML’s interests, ASML’s business or the  interests of ASML’s stakeholders are at stake. This may be  the case if: • a public bid for ASML’s shares is announced or made,  or there is a justified expectation that such a bid will be  made without any agreement having been reached with  ASML in relation to such a bid; or  • in the opinion of the Foundation’s Board of Directors,  the (attempted) exercise of the voting rights by one  shareholder or more shareholders, acting in concert,  is materially in conflict with ASML’s interests, ASML’s  business or ASML’s stakeholders. Objectives of the Foundation The Foundation’s objectives are to look after the interests  of ASML and the enterprises maintained by and/or  affiliated in a group with ASML, in such a way that the  interests of ASML, of those enterprises and of all parties  concerned are safeguarded in the best possible way, and  that influences in conflict with these interests, which might  affect the independence or the identity of ASML and those  companies, are deterred to the best of the Foundation’s  ability, and everything related to the above or possibly  conducive thereto. The Foundation aims to realize its  objects by acquiring and holding cumulative preference  shares in the capital of ASML and by exercising the rights  attached to these shares, particularly the voting rights. The Preference Share Option The Preference Share Option gives the Foundation the  right to acquire such number of cumulative preference  shares as the Foundation will require, provided that the  aggregate nominal value of such number of cumulative  preference shares shall not exceed the aggregate nominal  value of the ordinary shares issued at the time of exercise  of the Preference Share Option. The subscription price will  be equal to their nominal value. Only one-fourth of the  subscription price would be payable at the time of initial  issuance of the cumulative preference shares, with the  other three-fourths of the nominal value only being payable  when ASML calls up this amount. Exercise of the  preference share option could effectively dilute the voting  power of the outstanding ordinary shares by one-half. Cancellation of cumulative preference shares Cancellation and repayment of the issued cumulative  preference shares by ASML requires authorization by the  General Meeting, on a proposal to this effect made by the  Board of Management and approved by the Supervisory  Board. If the Preference Share Option is exercised and as a  result cumulative preference shares are issued, ASML will  initiate the repurchase or cancellation of all cumulative  preference shares held by the Foundation on the  Foundation’s request. In that case, ASML is obliged to  effect the repurchase and respective cancellation as soon  as possible. A cancellation will result in a repayment of the  amount paid and exemption from the obligation to pay up  on the cumulative preference shares. A repurchase of the  cumulative preference shares can only take place when  such shares are fully paid up. If the Foundation does not request ASML to repurchase or cancel all cumulative preference shares held by the Foundation  within 20 months of issuance of these shares, we will be required to convene a General Meeting for the purpose of  deciding on a repurchase or cancellation of these shares. Board of Directors The Foundation is independent of ASML. The Board of Directors of the Foundation is composed of four independent  members from the Netherlands’ business and academic communities. The Foundation’s Board of Directors is composed  of the following members: Mr A.P.M. van der Poel, Mr S. Perrick, Mr A.H. Lundqvist and Mr. Streppel. Other than the arrangements made with the Foundation as described above, ASML has not established any other anti- takeover devices. Major shareholders The Dutch Act on the supervision of financial markets and US securities laws contain requirements regarding the  disclosure of capital interests and voting rights in listed companies. The following table sets forth the total number of  ordinary shares owned by each shareholder that reported to the Dutch AFM or the US SEC a beneficial ownership of  ordinary shares that is at least 3.0% (5.0%, in the case of the SEC) of our ordinary shares issued and outstanding. Also  included in the table below is the total number of ordinary shares owned by our members of the Board of Management as  of December 31, 2020. The information set out below with respect to shareholders is based on public filings with the SEC  and AFM as of January 31, 2021. As reported to the AFM on February 28, 2020, Capital Research & Management Company ("CRMC") reports 572,929,434 voting rights, corresponding to 63,658,826 ordinary  shares (based on 9 votes per share), but do not report ownership rights related to those shares. Capital World Investors reported on a Schedule 13-G/A filed with the SEC  on February 14, 2020, that it is the beneficial owner of 34,865,768 shares of our ordinary shares as a result of its affiliation with CRMC. Capital International Investors, which  consists of  Capital International Investors divisions of CRMC and Capital Bank and Trust Company, as well as the following CRMC  subsidiaries: Capital International Limited,  Capital International Sarl, Capital International K.K. and Capital  International, Inc, reported on a Schedule 13-G/A filed with the SEC on February 14, 2020 that it is the  beneficial owner of 21,988,261 of our ordinary shares. We believe that some or all of these shares are included within the shares reported to be owned by Capital Research  and Management Company, as set forth above.  2. Based solely on the Schedule 13-G/A filed by BlackRock Inc. with the SEC on January 29, 2021; BlackRock reports voting power with respect to 28,755,630 of these shares.  A public filing with the AFM on November 9, 2020 shows an aggregate indirect capital interest of 5.68% and voting rights of 6.92%, based on the total number of issued  shares and voting rights at that time.  3. A public filing with the AFM on October 1, 2019 shows Baillie Gifford & Co have 147,694,140 voting rights, corresponding to 18,262,995 shares (based on 9 votes per share),  but no ownership rights related to those shares.  4. Does not include unvested shares granted to members of the Board of Management. For further information see Leadership and governance - Remuneration report. 5. No shares are owned by members of the Supervisory Board.  6. As a percentage of the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding (416,514,034) as of December 31, 2020, which excludes 2,983,454 ordinary shares which have  been issued but are held in treasury by ASML. The share ownership percentages reported to the AFM are expressed as a percentage of the total number of ordinary shares  issued (including treasury stock) and accordingly, percentages reflected in this table may differ from percentages reported to the AFM.

The financial  statements included therein are prepared in accordance  with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and EU- IFRS; • The Annual Report on Form 20-F, prepared in  accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act.  The financial statements included therein are prepared  in conformity with US GAAP. Both reports have the same qualitative base and describe  the same risk factors that are specific to the semiconductor  industry, ASML and ASML’s shares. We also provide  sensitivity analyses by providing: • A narrative explanation of ASML’s financial statements; • The context within which financial information should be  analyzed; • Information about the quality, and variability, of our  earnings and cash flow. With respect to the process of creating the Annual Report,  we have extensive guidelines for the content and layout of  our report. These guidelines are primarily based on the  applicable laws and regulations referred to above. With  respect to the preparation process of these and the other  financial reports, we apply internal procedures to safeguard  the completeness and accuracy of such information as  part of its disclosure controls and procedures. The  Disclosure Committee assists the Board of Management in  overseeing ASML’s disclosure activities and ensures  compliance with applicable disclosure requirements arising  under Dutch and US law, and other regulatory  requirements. These internal procedures are frequently  discussed by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory  Board. See also How we manage risk - Business risk and  continuity where ASML’s internal risk management and  control systems are discussed. The Supervisory Board has reviewed and approved, and all  Supervisory Board members signed, ASML’s 2020 financial  statements as prepared by the Board of Management.  KPMG has duly examined our financial statements, and  the Auditor’s Report is included in the Consolidated  Financial Statements. External Audit  In accordance with Dutch law, our external auditor is  appointed by the General Meeting, based on a nomination  for appointment by the Supervisory Board. The  Supervisory Board bases its nomination on the advice from  the Audit Committee and the Board of Management, who  annually provide a report to the Supervisory Board on the  performance of and relationship with the external auditor,  as well as its independence. ASML’s current external  auditor, KPMG, was first appointed by the General Meeting  in 2015 for the reporting year 2016, and has been  reappointed on a yearly basis since then. At the 2019  AGM, KPMG was appointed as the external auditor for the  reporting year 2020. Internal Audit The role of our Internal Audit function is to assess our  systems of internal controls by performing independent  procedures such as risk-based operational audits, IT audits  and compliance audits. The Internal Audit department  reports directly to the Audit Committee and the Board of  Management. The yearly Internal Audit plan is discussed  with and approved by the Audit Committee, the Board of  Management and the Supervisory Board. The follow-up on  the Internal Audit findings and progress made compared to  the plan are discussed on a quarterly basis with the Audit  Committee. The external auditor and Internal Audit  department have meetings on a regular basis. financial year. The audit plan also includes, among others,  the activities of the external auditor with respect to their  limited procedures on the quarterly results other than the  annual accounts. Proposed services may be preapproved  at the beginning of the year by the Audit Committee  (annual pre-approval) or may be pre-approved during the  year by the Audit Committee in case of a particular  engagement (specific pre-approval). The annual pre- approval is based on a detailed, itemized list of services to  be provided, which is designed to ensure there is no  management discretion in determining whether a service  has been approved, and to ensure the Audit Committee is  informed of each service it is pre-approving. Dutch and US rules require strict separation of audit and  advisory services for Dutch public-interest entities. Dutch  law prohibits the acceptance by the external auditor of  other services when an audit is performed. The Audit  Committee monitors compliance with Dutch and US rules  on services provided by the external auditor. The remuneration of external auditor is approved by the  Audit Committee on behalf of the Supervisory Board, and  after consulting the Board of Management. As the Audit  Committee has the most relevant insight and experience in  this area, the Supervisory Board has delegated these  responsibilities to the Audit Committee. For more  information on principal accountant fees and services see  Other appendices - Appendix - Principal accountant fees  and services. In principle, the external auditor attends all the Audit  Committee meetings. The external auditor’s findings are  discussed at these meetings. The Audit Committee reports  to the Supervisory Board on the topics discussed with the  external auditor, including the external auditor’s reports  with regard to the audit of the annual reports as well as the  content of the annual reports. Furthermore, the external  auditor also attends the Supervisory Board meeting in  which the annual external audit report is discussed. The  external auditor may also attend Supervisory Board  meetings in which the quarterly financial results are  discussed. The Audit Committee is informed by the external auditor  without delay in case the external auditor would discover  irregularities in the content of the audit of the financial  reports. The external auditor is present at our AGM to respond to  questions, if any, from the shareholders about the auditor’s  report on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate Information ASML Holding N.V. is a holding company that operates through its subsidiaries. We have operating subsidiaries in the  Netherlands, the United States, Italy, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, South Korea, Taiwan,  Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia and Israel. Our major operating subsidiaries, each of which is ultimately  wholly owned by ASML Holding N.V., are ASML Netherlands B.V., ASML Hong Kong Ltd. and ASML US LLC. See Exhibit  index - Exhibit 8.1 - List of main subsidiaries. US Listing Requirements As ASML's New York Shares are listed on NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (‘NASDAQ’), NASDAQ corporate governance  standards in principle apply to us. However, NASDAQ rules provide that foreign private issuers may follow home country  practice in lieu of the NASDAQ corporate governance standards subject to certain exceptions and except to the extent  that such exemptions would be contrary to US federal securities laws. Our corporate governance practices are primarily  based on Dutch requirements. The table below sets forth the practices followed by ASML in lieu of NASDAQ rules. Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code  We closely follow the developments in the area of corporate governance and the applicability of the relevant corporate  governance rules for ASML. Any substantial changes to ASML’s corporate governance structure or application of the  Corporate Governance Code will be submitted to the General Meeting for discussion. We are of the opinion that ASML fully complies with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.  The Board of Management and the Supervisory Board,   Veldhoven, February 10, 2021 Quorum ASML does not follow NASDAQ’s quorum requirements applicable to meetings of ordinary shareholders. In  accordance with Dutch law and generally accepted Dutch business practice, ASML’s Articles of Association  provide that there are no quorum requirements generally applicable to general meetings of shareholders. Solicitation of proxies ASML does not follow NASDAQ’s requirements regarding the solicitation of proxies and the provision  of proxy statements for general meetings of shareholders. ASML does furnish proxy statements  and solicit proxies for the General Meeting. Dutch corporate law sets a mandatory (participation  and voting) record date for Dutch listed companies at the 28th day prior to the date of the General  Meeting. Shareholders registered at such record date are entitled to attend and exercise their rights  as shareholders at the General Meeting, regardless of sale of shares after the record date. Distribution Annual  Report ASML does not follow NASDAQ’s requirement regarding distribution to shareholders of copies of an  annual report containing audited Financial Statements prior to our AGM. The distribution of our Annual  Reports to shareholders is not required under Dutch corporate law or Dutch securities laws, or by Euronext  Amsterdam. Furthermore, it is generally accepted business practice for Dutch companies not to distribute  annual reports. In part, this is because the Dutch system of bearer shares has made it impractical to keep  a current list of holders of the bearer shares in order to distribute the annual reports. Instead, we make our  Annual Report available at our corporate head office in the Netherlands (and at the offices of our Dutch  listing agent as stated in the convening notice for the meeting) no later than 42 days prior to convocation  of the AGM. In addition, we post a copy of our Annual Reports on our Website prior to the AGM. Equity compensation  arrangements  ASML does not follow NASDAQ’s requirement to obtain shareholder approval of stock option or purchase  plans or other equity compensation arrangements available to officers, directors or employees. It is not  required under Dutch law or generally accepted practice for Dutch companies to obtain shareholder  approval of equity compensation arrangements available to officers, directors or employees. The  General Meeting adopts the Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management, approves equity  compensation arrangements for the Board of Management and approves the remuneration for the  Supervisory Board. The Remuneration Committee evaluates the achievements of individual members  of the Board of Management with respect to the short and long-term quantitative performance, the full  Supervisory Board evaluates the quantitative performance criteria. Equity compensation arrangements for  employees are adopted by the Board of Management within limits approved by the General Meeting. The year 2020 was extremely turbulent due the global  COVID-19 pandemic, yet ASML managed to move through  this period in a remarkably successful way. The  Supervisory Board wishes to commend all ASML  employees who supported each other in these difficult  times, and who remained committed to serving customers  around the world in the face of the most stringent  peacetime travel and contact restrictions. The Supervisory  Board members, too, experienced some of the challenges  faced by ASML employees. As with the hundreds of  colleagues who joined the company during the pandemic,  and had to be onboarded virtually, the Supervisory Board  welcomed two new board members we have yet to meet in  a physical setting. ASML was well prepared when the crisis hit the global  stage early in 2020. It very quickly implemented a wide  range of measures to keep its people safe and support its  communities with protective equipment and  communication tools. We fully support ASML's unwavering  commitment to prioritize employee health and safety. With employees safe and secure in the work place and at  home, ASML’s next priority was to support our customers  with their production plans despite the severe restrictions.  ASML employees worked miracles and overcame  obstacles every day, from solving supply chain bottlenecks,  to the introduction of augmented reality glasses that  enabled mid-level engineers to provide specialized support  in customer fabs. The ingenuity and flexibility of ASML  employees and our partners in the supply chain impressed  us all. Additionally, it was also priority to continue ASML’s  ambitious technology development program. When looking  at the roadmap, the Supervisory Board was pleased to see  progress in improving maturity of the EUV scanner platform  and the advances in the development of the next- generation EUV platform: the High-NA systems that will  first ship a few years from now. Keeping control of affordability and quality of lithography systems was a  specific focus area for the Supervisory Board, due to the  increasing technological complexity of the most advanced  systems. Combined with increasing focus on re-use and  the circular economy, we see improved performance on  long-term value creation, which serves not only customers,  but all ASML's stakeholders.  As a Supervisory Board we are convinced that ASML’s  focus on people and leadership development is critical to  its success as a fast growing organization. Therefore a lot  of attention was given to the new Leadership Framework,  which provides the instruments to help leaders grow their  skills and competences, and prepare for increasing  responsibilities. Lastly, as if 2020 had not brought enough challenges, the  year also emerged as one with deteriorating geopolitical  relationships. The semiconductor industry is one of the  battlefields in a trade conflict between the world’s  superpowers. ASML’s position has always been clear: that  while the company always operates within applicable rules  and regulations, the world’s electronics ecosystem is best  served with a global and open market, where all players  can collaborate and compete on equal terms. Such a global, open, high-tech industry delivers the fastest  innovation with the available resources in the ecosystem.  The significant R&D intensity of the semiconductor industry  is a clear incentive to avoid fragmentation. Unilateral trade  restrictions that were introduced in 2020 however may  eventually lead to such fragmentation with all its negative  consequences. Despite some global geopolitical uncertainty and ongoing  efforts to overcome the COVID-19 crisis, the Supervisory  Board is nevertheless optimistic about ASML’s future and  we believe strongly that ASML has the right vision which is  to enable groundbreaking technology to solve some of  humanity’s toughest challenges and the right strategy to  support the global electronics ecosystem, delivering  positive outcomes for all its stakeholders. The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Board  of Management in performing its management tasks and  setting the direction for ASML. The Supervisory Board  focuses on long-term and sustainable value creation, with  the goal to ensure that the Board of Management pursues  a strategy that secures its leading position as a supplier of  holistic lithography solutions to the semiconductor industry.  We uphold an appropriate system of checks and balances,  provide oversight, evaluate performance and give advice  where required or requested. Through good governance,  we help to ensure that ASML acts in the best interests of  the company and its stakeholders. In this Supervisory  Board Report, we report on our activities in 2020. Our activities in 2020 The agenda of the Supervisory Board is driven by the  Strategic Priorities for ASML as agreed in the Annual  Strategy Review between the Supervisory Board and the  Board of Management and by our Annual Financial  Calendar. Recurring agenda items are developments in the  semiconductor market and the customer domain, financial  and operational performance and ASML's share price  development and investor perceptions. During 2020, the  (potential) impact of COVID-19 was also a recurring topic  of discussion. Strategy review During 2020, the Supervisory Board devoted a  considerable amount of time discussing strategic topics.  We performed the recurring annual review of ASML's  overall corporate strategy, the long-term financial plan and  the long-term plans of the EUV, DUV and Applications  business lines. Special attention was paid to the  introduction of 'strengthen customer trust' as a new,  overarching element of the corporate strategy, which we,  as a Supervisory Board, fully support. As part of the annual  strategy review we held dedicated break-out sessions to  discuss, from various perspectives, the strategic  challenges related to the current geopolitical situation. The Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Board of Management in performing its  management tasks and setting the direction for ASML, focusing on long-term and sustainable  value creation. The members of the Supervisory Board are fully independent. Financial review We reviewed the annual and interim financial statements,  including non-financial information, the quarterly results  and accompanying press releases, as well as the  outcomes of the year-end US GAAP and EU-IFRS audits. Given ASML's rapid growth, the Supervisory Board  suggested reviewing the process with the Board of  Management to discuss and agree on the annual plan, the  long-term financial plan as well as large R&D and CAPEX  plans, for which an additional Supervisory Board meeting  was convened. As part of the financial updates, the Supervisory Board,  assisted by the Audit Committee, reviewed ASML's  financing and capital return policies. The Supervisory  External speakers were invited to provide their views on  this topic, allowing the Supervisory Board to take into  account various perspectives on this topic. Besides the annual strategy review, strategic topics were  addressed throughout the year by means of deep dives,  allowing focused, in-depth review by the Supervisory  Board. Topics covered in deep dive sessions during 2020  include the Mature Products & Services strategy, the  Installed Base & Services strategy and the Data Policy. The Supervisory Board also performed an in-depth review  of the High-NA program, looking at market and customer- related aspects as well as the technological and  operational dimension of the program and the risks  associated with it. An external speaker was invited to  provide an outside-in view on High-NA, focusing on the  role of High-NA in driving Moore's Law and allowing the  development of ever-more powerful chips for new  applications and devices by our customers at reduced  cost. The Supervisory Board particularly focused on  aspects such as affordability and quality of the tools in view  of increasing complexity. 97.8% Board approved the Board of Management’s proposals for  the 2020 interim dividend and discussed the 2020 final  dividend proposal, which will be submitted to the General  Meeting in April 2021. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board  approved the 2020-2022 share buyback program and  discussed the execution of the program with the Board of  Management on a quarterly basis. Lastly, the issuance of  two Eurobonds was approved by the Supervisory Board. Risk management As risk management is a key element of the Supervisory  Board’s responsibilities, we received periodic risk- management updates during the year. Attention was paid  to the risk landscape and the developments in that area,  the risk appetite and the measures put in place by the  Board of Management to mitigate the critical risks. Special  attention was paid to the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic on ASML's risk landscape and the risk  responses defined by management. Bi-annually, specific  risk areas were reviewed in deep dive sessions. Topics  covered in 2020 include IT continuity, IT security, and  political risks in light of the global trade situation. For  further information on ASML's risk management, see the  section 'How we manage risk'. People and organization Given the significant growth of ASML in recent years,  people and organization continued to be an area of focus  for the Supervisory Board in 2020. On several occasions,  we were provided with updates in this area. We spent time  discussing the culture and values initiative, which was set- up in 2019 and implemented in 2020, with the aim to  support the execution of ASML's strategy aimed at long- term value creation for all stakeholders. We also reviewed  the ASML leadership framework and discussed the results  of the annual employee engagement survey. Furthermore,  the Supervisory Board, assisted by the Selection and  Nomination Committee, extensively discussed and  provided advice in respect of ASML's talent management  and people development program as well as succession  planning for the Board of Management and senior  management. IT and Our New Enterprise (ONE) As the pace of business and technology transformation  continue to accelerate, the importance of the IT strategy  within ASML increases. This led the Supervisory Board to  perform a review of ASML's IT strategy, focusing on both  the IT foundational services strategy and the initiatives  aimed at improving the business with IT. On two occasions during 2020, the Board of Management  updated us on the status of the ONE program. ONE is  ASML’s transformation program dedicated to secure  configuration integrity over the life cycle of our customer  offerings while enhancing the business processes and  maintaining flexibility, with the support of its upgraded  backbone information system. We paid special attention to  the expected benefits and risks of the program, and  discussed with management the challenges related to it,  such as change management and business process  transformation. Meetings with the Works Council A Supervisory Board delegation held two formal meetings  with the Works Council in 2020. We exchanged views on  ASML's strategy and priorities, including the continued  implementation of the EUV roadmap, the initiatives on customers. We performed a post-acquisition review of  HMI, which ASML acquired in 2016. Though, due to  changed market circumstances, the acquisition business  plan had not been fully realized, the conclusion was that  value creation still could be achieved, as HMI, together  with other parts of ASML, will contribute to the building of a  comprehensive product roadmap for metrology and  inspection. We also paid attention to the sustainability strategy, not  only because sustainability is also a long-term qualitative  target for the Board of Management, but also because it is  now also covered in the corporate strategy as part of the  'strengthen customer trust' element. We are pleased with  the increasing focus on re-use and circular economy, which  contributes to ASML's performance on long-term value  creation, thereby serving customers as well as other  stakeholders. The Supervisory Board also monitored compliance with  rules and regulations including the Dutch Corporate  Governance Code and reviewed the legal matters  overview. As a Supervisory Board, we also extensively discussed our  own composition, profile and functioning, the composition  and functioning of its committees as well as the  composition and functioning of the Board of Management.  We also monitored the performance of the Board of  Management and decided on the Board of Management's  remuneration targets and target achievements. More  information can be found in the reports of the Selection  and Nomination Committee and the Remuneration  Committee. There was one site visit in 2020: we visited the  Development and Engineering (D&E) sector at ASML's  headquarters, and were updated on how this sector is  organized and what the key priorities are. There was a  particular focus on the Product Generation Process and  the D&E operating model, which was amended to serve  the changing needs of ASML's customers and its business  lines. As a Supervisory Board we closely monitored the  development of the COVID-19 pandemic and the  potential impact on our people, business and operations.  Management kept us informed during the scheduled  meetings, but we also received separate updates, informing  us about the main developments in our company, markets  and supply chain. We support management's approach,  choosing the health and safety of our people and their  families and business continuity as priorities, and we are  pleased to see that the values of Challenge, Collaborate  and Care served as a strong basis dealing with the  challenges of this pandemic. Looking back at 2020, while  we realize that COVID-19 is not behind us, we can say  management has delivered on its priorities. quality and cost reduction, the supply chain, management development and succession and the ONE program. The  culture and values initiative was also discussed, in particular how the Supervisory Board was involved and what the Board  sees as the main challenges for implementation. Another topic of discussion was the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on  ASML in various areas, and the challenges of working from home, while at the same time maintaining the innovative nature  of ASML. The composition of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management was discussed, especially the  increase of the number of Supervisory Board members to nine and the proposals for (re)appointment of Supervisory  Board members. The Works Council and Supervisory Board also discussed the Remuneration Policies for Board of  Management and Supervisory Board prior to submission to the General Meeting. Topics overview 2020 Topics discussed at the Supervisory Board meetings are a combination of recurring topics and other topics that are  relevant during the year. Our recurring agenda topics are: Meetings and attendance The Supervisory Board meets at least four times per year in accordance with an annual meeting schedule and whenever  the Chairman, one or more of its members, or the Board of Management requests a meeting. In 2020, the Supervisory Board held nine meetings. Of these meetings, one was held at the company's headquarters in  Veldhoven, one was held via telephone conference and seven meetings were held virtually. In addition to these meetings,  there were several informal meetings and telephone calls among Supervisory Board and/or Board of Management  members. The Supervisory Board meetings and the Supervisory Board committee meetings are held over several days, ensuring  there is time for review and discussion. At each meeting, the Supervisory Board members discuss among themselves the  goals and outcome of the meeting, as well as topics such as the functioning and composition of the Supervisory Board  and the Board of Management. Also discussed during each meeting are the reports from the different Committees of the  Supervisory Board. Q3 • 2020 statutory interim report • M&A update • Strategy review, incl. • Semiconductor industry outlook & ASML vision • Long term strategy & technology roadmap • Global trade situation and strategic implications Appointed at the AGM on April 22. 2020 also appointed as a member of the Technology Committee at the same date. 2. Appointed at the AGM on April 22. 2020 also appointed as a member of the Audit Committee at the same date. 3. Stepped down per the AGM on April 22, 2020. The majority of the Supervisory Board and Supervisory  Board committees meetings in 2020 were held virtually  due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the challenges  resulting from meeting virtually, various measures were  taken: we planned shorter meeting sessions spread over  more days; we held break-out sessions in smaller groups  to optimize interaction, and we also made use of video as  a means for meeting preparation, in addition to providing  written meeting documents. The Supervisory Board is  very positive about these virtual meetings and intends to  continue to use several of these measures going forward,  including when in-person meetings are possible again. The Supervisory Board meetings and the meetings of the  four Supervisory Board committees were well attended, as  is shown in the table below. In addition to the Supervisory Board members, the  members of the Board of Management are invited to the  Supervisory Board meetings. All Board of Management  members were present for the Supervisory Board meetings  in 2020. Members of senior management are regularly  invited to provide updates on topics within their area of  expertise. This gives the Supervisory Board the opportunity  to get acquainted with a variety of ASML managers, which  the Supervisory Board considers very useful in connection  with its talent management and succession planning  activities. Composition The Supervisory Board determines the number of Supervisory Board members required to perform its functions, the  minimum being three members. The Supervisory Board currently consists of nine members. The Supervisory Board  attaches great importance to its composition, independence and diversity and strives to meet all the associated guidelines  and requirements. To ensure an appropriate and balanced composition, the Supervisory Board spends considerable time  on an ongoing basis discussing its profile, composition and rotation schedule. Independence In order to properly perform its tasks, the Supervisory Board considers it to be very important that its members are able to  act critically and independently of one another, the Board of Management and other stakeholders. The independence of  the Supervisory Board and its individual members is assessed on an annual basis.  All current members of the Supervisory  Board are fully independent, as defined by the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, and have completed the annual  questionnaire addressing the relevant independence requirements. Diversity The current composition of ASML’s Supervisory Board is diverse in terms of gender, nationality, knowledge, experience  and background and has a suitable level of experience in the financial, economic, technological, social and legal aspects  of international business. Changes in composition in 2020 Per the 2020 AGM, the term of appointment of Annet Aris and Wolfgang Ziebart expired. Ziebart stepped down from  the Supervisory Board per the 2020 AGM, after 11 years of service. Aris made herself available for reappointment. In  addition to nominating persons for filling the vacancies arising due to the retirement by rotation of Ms. Aris and Mr. Ziebart,  the Supervisory Board decided to nominate another candidate for appointment to the Supervisory Board, thereby  increasing the number of members to nine. The Supervisory Board wanted to use the opportunity to add an additional  member with a background and experience in semiconductor technology, and the semiconductor industry in 2020,  anticipating the upcoming retirement of Mr. Grose in 2021. The Board's rotation schedule was also taken into account in  nominating an additional member.  The Works Council of ASML Netherlands B.V. decided not to use its enhanced  recommendation right in respect of this appointment, because of the temporary nature of the increase in the number of  Supervisory Board members. At the 2020 AGM, Mark Durcan and Warren East were appointed for a term of four years.  Ms. Aris was reappointed for a term of four years; her reappointment was also based on the Works Council's enhanced  recommendation right. Changes in composition in 2021 Per the 2021 AGM, the appointment terms of Carla Smits-Nusteling and Douglas Grose will expire. Both Supervisory  Board members have informed the Supervisory Board that they are not available for reappointment and will retire per the  2021 AGM, upon completion of their current term. The Supervisory Board extends its thanks to both Ms. Smits-Nusteling  and Mr. Grose for their valuable contribution over the past eight years, during which the Supervisory Board has greatly  benefited from their knowledge and experience. As announced on January 20, 2021, the Supervisory Board  intends to nominate Ms. Birgit Conix for appointment as  member of the Supervisory Board effective from the 2021  AGM. In preparation for her appointment, Ms. Conix  attended a number of Supervisory Board meetings as an  observer in order to ensure a smooth onboarding. The  agenda and explanatory notes for the 2021 AGM will  contain further information about this intended nomination  for appointment. For further information and background on the members of  the Supervisory Board, including details on nationality,  gender and age, please see the Supervisory Board  members’ information in Leadership and governance -  Corporate governance - Supervisory Board as well as the  Supervisory Board skills matrix. Induction and training We have a comprehensive induction program in place for  newly appointed Supervisory Board members, designed to  ensure that new members gain a good understanding of  our business and strategy, as well as the key risks we face.  The induction program includes meetings with other  Supervisory Board and Board of Management members, a  technology tutorial and detailed presentations by our  Business Lines, Sectors and Corporate departments. A site  visit and factory tour is also part of the induction program.  On joining the Supervisory Board, Mark Durcan and Warren  East followed an induction program, which was held fully  virtually. The Supervisory Board is provided with regular updates on  a variety of topics, both in the plenary meetings and in the  meetings of the committees. During 2020, we also invited  external speakers on a number of occasions in order to  obtain outside-in views on topics such as geopolitics and  the value of new technologies such as High-NA for the  semiconductor industry. Evaluation The Supervisory Board greatly values the structural and  ongoing evaluation process as a means of ensuring  continuous improvement in our way of working. Each year,  the Supervisory Board, assisted by the Selection and  Nomination Committee, evaluates the composition,  competence and functioning of the Supervisory Board and  its committees, the relationship between the Supervisory  Board and the Board of Management, its committees, its  individual members, the chairs of both the Supervisory  Board and the committees, as well as the composition and  functioning of the Board of Management and its individual  members, and the education and training needs for the  Supervisory Board and Board of Management members. In principle, the evaluation of the Supervisory Board is  performed once every three years by an external adviser; in  the other two years, the evaluation of the Supervisory  Board is performed by means of a self-assessment using a  written questionnaire, followed by one-on-one meetings  between the Chair and individual Supervisory Board  members. The 2020 evaluation of the Supervisory Board and its  committees was performed through a web-based survey,  which was prepared by the Selection and Nomination  Committee. The chair of the committee also held meetings  with the individual Supervisory Board members. The  evaluation was centered around the following themes:  composition, stakeholder oversight, oversight of strategy,  risk management and succession planning, management  and focus of meetings and priorities for improvement. In  addition, the evaluation included a case study of how  effectively the Supervisory Board oversaw the Board of  Management in addressing the challenges of the  COVID-19 pandemic.  An upward review by the Board of  Management was also part of the annual assessment. The results of the Supervisory Board evaluation were  discussed in early 2021. The conclusion was that the  Supervisory Board and its committees continue to function  well. Suggestions to further improve the functioning of the  Supervisory Board include optimizing the meeting agenda  to ensure an appropriate balance between recurring items  and strategic topics, as well as the balance between  presentation and discussion during meetings, and  increasing the engagement with management and the  organization, also outside meetings. Important focus area  identified was the successful onboarding and integration of  new members, also in light of the challenges related to the  COVID-19 pandemic. The Board of Management also conducted a self- evaluation in 2020, focusing on the role, responsibilities  and functioning of the Board of Management collectively,  and on the functioning of the individual Board of  Management members. This self-evaluation was  performed in a number of separate sessions dedicated to  this topic. The self-evaluation was facilitated by the EVP  HR&O, who held interviews with the individual Board of  Management members in preparation for the discussion.  Themes addressed include the Board of Management's  strategic focus, stakeholder involvement, people &  organization, board dynamics and board organization. After  the discussion, a summary was prepared per theme with  items to be followed up on. Follow-up will take place in  several special Board of Management sessions planned  throughout 2021. The overall conclusion of the self- evaluation was that ASML has a well-functioning Board of  Management. The self-evaluation was also discussed with  the Supervisory Board and its Selection and Nomination  Committee. The Supervisory Board has four standing committees, whose members are appointed by  the Supervisory Board from among its members. The full Supervisory Board remains responsible for all decisions, even if prepared and taken by one of the Supervisory Board’s Committees. The four committees of the Supervisory Board prepare the decision-making of the full Board. In the plenary Supervisory  Board meetings, the chairs of the committees report on the items discussed in the committee meetings. In addition, the  meeting documents and minutes of the committee meetings are available to all Supervisory Board members, enabling the  full Supervisory Board to make the appropriate decisions. Audit Committee The Audit Committee assists the Supervisory Board in overseeing the integrity and quality of our financial reporting and  the effectiveness of the internal risk management and internal control systems. The Audit Committee is provided with all relevant information to be able to adequately and efficiently supervise the  preparation and disclosure of financial information. This includes information on the status and development of the  (semiconductor) market to be able to judge the outlook and budget for the next six to 12 months, the application of EU- IFRS and US GAAP, the choice of accounting policies and the work of the internal and external auditor. The members of the Audit Committee are all  independent members of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has determined that both Ms. Smits- Nusteling and Mr. Schwalb qualify as an Audit Committee  financial expert pursuant to Section 407 of the Sarbanes- Oxley Act and Dutch statutory rules, taking into consideration  their extensive financial backgrounds and experience. • Integrity and quality of ASML's financial statements and related  non-financial disclosure and submitting proposals to ensure  such integrity; • Accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of  the financial statements; • Effectiveness of our internal risk management and control  systems, including the compliance with the relevant legislation  and regulations, and the effect of codes of conduct; • Integrity and effectiveness of our system of disclosure controls  and procedures and our system of internal controls over  financial reporting; • External Auditor’s qualifications, independence, performance  and determining its compensation; and • Functioning of Internal Audit. Audit Committee meetings in 2020 The Audit Committee meets at least four times a year and always before the publication of the quarterly, half-year and  annual financial results. In 2020, the Audit Committee held nine meetings. The below overview provides a number of topics discussed during Audit Committee meetings in 2020, in addition to the  recurring agenda topics. Financials In 2020 the Audit Committee focused, among other things, on financial reporting, most particularly the review of ASML's  2020 Integrated and Interim Reports, including the annual and interim financial statements and non-financial information.  We also closely monitored the progress and discussed the outcomes of the year-end US GAAP and EU-IFRS audits. The  quarterly results and the accompanying press releases were reviewed before publication. The Audit Committee also  reviewed the press release issued on March 27, 2020 in which ASML updated the market on the expected Q1 2020  results, primarily related to the COVID-19 impact. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee was provided accounting updates by the Corporate Chief Accountant,  highlighting the main accounting matters relevant for the quarter. Other important elements of the Audit Committee's  quarterly procedures were the discussion of the observations of the External Auditor in relation to the accounting matters,  as well as the report by the Disclosure Committee on the accuracy and completeness of the quarterly disclosures.  Throughout the year, specific accounting topics were addressed in deep dive sessions. Several sessions were dedicated  to revenue recognition, which has been identified as a critical audit matter. These sessions focused on aspects such as  focus areas and process improvement projects in respect of revenue recognition. An annual in-depth balance sheet review  was also performed. The operational and financial short- and long-term performance of ASML was also discussed extensively, with a focus on  various performance scenarios and their impact on ASML’s results, cash generation, and financing and capital return  policies. A special meeting was organized to discuss the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASML's  business, results and cash situation. In addition to the Audit Committee members, the Chairman of  the Supervisory Board attends the Audit Committee meetings  whenever possible. The external auditor and the internal auditor  have a standing invitation for Audit Committee meetings and  attended all Audit Committee meetings in 2020. The CEO,  CFO, EVP Finance, Corporate Chief Accountant and the VP  Risk and Business Assurance are invited to the meetings. An area of attention for the Audit Committee in 2020 was  liquidity and free cash flow, due to the ongoing ramp-up of  EUV, and ASML's continued investment into the future,  which led to growth of net working capital and increased  R&D and capital expenditure spend. The Audit Committee reviewed and provided the  Supervisory Board with advice regarding the long-term  financial plan, the financing of ASML and ASML’s capital  return policy. Specifically discussed were the dividend  policy and the proposed final dividend payment in respect  of the 2019 and 2020 financial years and the interim  dividend for the 2020.  The 2020-2022 share buyback  program was discussed on a quarterly basis, focusing on  the desirability of issuing quarterly mandates in view of the  cash position and free cash flow of ASML, also taking into  account the potential impact of COVID-19. We also  discussed the issuance of two bond offerings during 2020  and provided the Supervisory Board with our  recommendations in this area. Risk management and internal control  Throughout 2020, the Audit Committee closely monitored  risk management and the risk-management process,  including the timely follow-up of high-priority actions based  on quarterly progress updates. The Audit Committee  oversaw the annual internal control process. Focus was on  scoping, materiality levels, updates to the internal control  framework, the tests of design and effectiveness and  management's assessment of ASML's internal control over  financial reporting and disclosures. The observations made  by the Internal Auditor and the External Auditor on the  design and effectiveness of internal controls were also  discussed with the Audit Committee. In 2020, an in-depth  review was performed of ASML's internal control  framework, with focus on the level of automation of  controls. Compliance and ethics During 2020 we discussed ASML's compliance program  and performed detailed reviews of specific compliance  topics such as treasury compliance and customs  compliance. An annual fraud update was provided and  quarterly reports were given on the Ethics program,  including whistleblower reporting. The Audit Committee  was also involved in the update of our Code of Conduct  and business principles, which was implemented in  November 2020. Internal audit The Audit Committee reviewed the annual internal audit  plan, including the scope of the audit. The Audit  Committee was kept updated on the progress of the  internal audit activities on a quarterly basis and reviewed the results of audits performed as well as the status of the  follow-up on action plans. The Audit Committee also  discussed the internal management letter and monitored  the follow-up by the Board of Management on the  recommendations made in the internal management letter. External audit  The Audit Committee reviewed the 2020 external audit  plan, including scoping, materiality level and fees. It  monitored the progress of the external audit activities,  including review of the observations made in the quarterly  procedures and the audits performed at year-end. The  Audit Committee oversaw the follow-up by the Board of  Management on the control deficiencies reported by the  External Auditor in their periodic internal control update.  The Audit Committee confirms that the communication  over the 2020 financial year contained no significant items  that need to be mentioned in this report. The Audit Committee also evaluated the performance of  the external auditor at the end of 2020, including a review  of their independence. The results of the evaluation have  led the Audit Committee to recommend to the Supervisory  Board to submit to the 2021 AGM a proposal to appoint  KPMG as the External Auditor for the reporting year 2022. After completion of the 2020 audit, the current lead audit  partner will rotate off the ASML assignment. The Audit  Committee and the CFO have been involved in the  succession process of the new lead audit partner by  interviewing candidates and selecting the new lead partner,  as well as taking notice of the transition plan. As part of the  transition plan, the new lead audit partner joined the Audit  Committee meetings as an observer as of November 2020  to facilitate a smooth transition. Other topics  Other topics discussed by the Audit Committee in 2020  were ASML’s tax policy and planning, the Finance and IT  transformation program, the project to simplify ASML's  legal entity structure and the quarterly legal matters  overviews. The Audit Committee also performed an annual review and  update of its Rules of Procedure. After most of the Audit Committee meetings, the internal  and external auditor each have a session with the Audit  Committee without management present to discuss their  views on the matters warranting the attention of the Audit  Committee. This may include their relationship with the  Audit Committee, the relationship with the Board of  Management, and any other matters deemed necessary to  be discussed. The Audit Committee also held regular one- to-one meetings with the CFO. Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee advises the Supervisory Board, and prepares the Supervisory Board's resolutions with  respect to the remuneration of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board. Remuneration Committee meetings in 2020 The Remuneration Committee meets at least two times a year and more frequently when deemed necessary. In 2020, the  Remuneration Committee held five meetings. The below overview provides details on the topics discussed during Remuneration Committee meetings in 2020. Each member is an independent, non-executive member  of our Supervisory Board in accordance with the NASDAQ  Listing Rules. Schwalb is neither a former member  of our Board of Management, nor a member of the  management board of another company. Currently, no  member of the Remuneration Committee is a member of  the management board of another Dutch listed company. • Overseeing the development and implementation of the  Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management and  preparing the Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy; • Reviewing and proposing to the Supervisory Board corporate  goals and objectives relevant to the variable part of the Board  of Management’s remuneration; • Carrying out scenario analyses of the possible financial  outcomes on the variable remuneration of meeting these goals,  as well as exceeding these goals, before proposing these  corporate goals and objectives to the Supervisory Board for  approval; • Evaluating the performance of the members of the Board of  Management in view of those goals and objectives, and –  based on this evaluation – recommending to the Supervisory  Board appropriate compensation levels for the members of the  Board of Management. In addition to the Remuneration Committee members,  the Remuneration Committee generally invites the CEO,  the EVP HR&O, the Head of Compensation and Benefits  and in some instances also the CFO to attend (parts of)  its meetings. The Remuneration Committee’s external  advisor is also invited to attend the Remuneration  Committee meetings when deemed necessary. Remuneration Board of Management In Q1 2020, the Remuneration Committee finalized the  adjustments to be made to the Remuneration Policy for the  Board of Management in light of the implementation of the  revised EU Shareholder Rights Directive. The adjusted  Remuneration Policy was submitted to and adopted by the  General Meeting on April 22, 2020. In line with ASML's practice of benchmarking Board of  Management remuneration every two years, a benchmark  was performed in 2020 in order to assess the level of  competitiveness of the Board of Management's  remuneration. The Remuneration Committee also reviewed  the composition of the labor market reference group in  connection with the benchmark. Based on the outcome of  this review, the Supervisory Board intends to submit a  proposal for implementing some adjustments to the  Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management to the  2021 AGM.  The proposed adjustments will be set out in  the convocation documents for the 2021 AGM, which will  be published in March 2021. The Remuneration Committee made recommendations to  the Supervisory Board concerning the total remuneration  package of the Board of Management and the variable  remuneration consisting of a short term incentive in cash  and a long term incentive in shares.  The Remuneration  Committee proposed 2020 targets for the Board of  Management's variable remuneration to the Supervisory  Board. During the year, the Remuneration Committee  closely monitored the Board of Management's  performance. It provided recommendations to the  Supervisory Board regarding the achievement of the 2020  targets and related compensation levels for the Board  of Management members. Special attention was paid to  the impact of the COVID-19 on ASML's performance and  the potential consequences for Board of Management  remuneration. In proposing, and evaluating the Board of Management's  performance in relation to the corporate goals and  objectives for the variable remuneration of the Board of  Management members, the Remuneration Committee  closely cooperates with the Audit Committee and the  Technology Committee. The Remuneration Committee has taken note of the views  of the individual members of the Board of Management  with regard to the amount and structure of their  remuneration.  The Remuneration Committee reviewed the shareholding  positions of the Board of Management members based  upon the share ownership guideline of the Remuneration  Policy. The Remuneration Committee also reviewed the  Remuneration Report, which details the remuneration of  members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of  Management. As the 2019 Remuneration Report was  submitted to the 2020 AGM for an advisory vote, in line  with the new legal requirements resulting from the revised  EU Shareholder Rights Directive, the committee discussed  the result of the vote on this item: 93.78% of the votes  were cast in favor. The committee discussed the feedback  received from investors and shareholder interest  organizations on the Report. As a result of the discussion,  some enhancements were made to the 2020 Remuneration  Report, which is included in this Annual Report. The Remuneration Committee engaged the external  auditor to perform certain agreed-upon procedures with  respect to the execution of the Remuneration Policy. Remuneration Supervisory Board In Q1 2020 the Remuneration Committee finalized the  Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board in order to  comply with the revised EU Shareholder Rights Directive.  The policy was submitted to and adopted by the General  Meeting on April 22, 2020. The Remuneration Committee reviewed the reference  group for Supervisory Board remuneration and performed  a benchmark review in 2020. Based on this benchmark  review, the Supervisory Board intends to submit a proposal  for implementing some adjustments to the Remuneration  Policy for the Supervisory Board to the 2021 AGM. The  proposed adjustments will be set out in the convocation  documents for the 2021 AGM, which will be published in  March 2021. Selection and Nomination Committee   The Selection and Nomination Committee assists the Supervisory Board in relation to its responsibilities over the  composition and functioning of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management and to the monitoring of corporate  governance developments. Selection and Nomination Committee meetings The Selection and Nomination Committee meets at least two times a year and more frequently when deemed necessary.  In 2020, the Selection and Nomination Committee held five meetings. The below overview provides details on the topics discussed during Remuneration Committee meetings in 2020. Composition, role and responsibilities Board of Management  In 2020 the Selection and Nomination Committee spent ample time to discuss the future composition, role and  responsibilities of the Board of Management, e.g. reviewing the talent bench, discussing career development of top talent  to prepare for future Board of Management roles. The committee also assessed the functioning of the Board of  Management and its individual members. For this purpose, the Chair held meetings with each individual Board of  Management member, the outcome of which was discussed with the Committee. Frits van Hout will retire as member of ASML's Board of Management upon completion of his current appointment term,  which will end per the 2021 AGM. Frits van Hout first served with ASML from 1984 to 1992, later rejoining the company in  2001.

In 2018, Frits van Hout became  Chief Strategy Officer, focusing on strategy and strategic supplier relations, which has grown in significance given the rise  of EUV and High-NA EUV as well as e-beam metrology and optical systems. The Supervisory Board wants to thank Frits  for his significant contribution to ASML’s growth and development. ASML will not appoint a successor to Frits van Hout. As a result, the Board of Management will consist of five members  effective per the 2021 AGM. Frits van Hout's current responsibilities will be taken over by the remaining Board of  Management members, securing the uninterrupted execution of ASML’s strategy to reach its stated targets for  stakeholders. Composition, role and responsibilities Supervisory Board The Selection and Nomination Committee also extensively discussed the composition of the Supervisory Board. A  significant amount of time was spent discussing the Supervisory Board's rotation schedule, particularly the appointment  and reappointment of Supervisory Board members to fill vacancies both in the short and longer term. This resulted in  recommendations from the Selection and Nomination Committee to nominate two new members for appointment and  one current member for reappointment by the General Meeting in 2020. The Selection and Nomination Committee also  discussed the changes to its composition effective per the 2021 AGM and made a recommendation to the Supervisory  Board to nominate Birgit Conix as new Supervisory Board member.  For further details, see Supervisory Board report -  composition, independence and diversity. At the end of 2020 and early 2021, the Selection and Nomination Committee discussed the functioning of the individual  members of the Supervisory Board as well as the process and outcome of the Supervisory Board’s self-evaluation. For  further details on the self-evaluation, see Supervisory Board report - Evaluation. Corporate Governance  As part of its responsibility to monitor corporate governance developments, the Selection and Nomination Committee  discussed, among other things, the revised EU Shareholder Rights Directive as implemented into Dutch law in December  2019, and the impact on ASML, the legislative and other developments in relation to diversity and the focus items of  investors and shareholder interest organizations. Technology Committee The Technology Committee advises the Supervisory Board with respect to our technology plans required to execute our  business strategy. The Technology Committee is supported by external experts and  as experts from within ASML who act as advisers on the subjects  reviewed and discussed by this committee. External experts may  include representatives of customers, suppliers and partners  to increase the committee’s understanding of the technology  and research required to develop our leading-edge systems. • Advising on technology trends, the study of potential alternative  strategies, the technology strategy, product roadmaps, required  technical resources and operational performance in R&D; • Making recommendations to the Supervisory Board on  technology-related projects with respect to ASML’s competitive  position; • Discussing the technology targets set to measure short- and  long-term performance as well as the achievements related to  these, and advising the Remuneration Committee on this topic. Technology Committee meetings in 2020 In general, the Technology Committee meets at least two times a year and more frequently when deemed necessary. In  2020, the Technology Committee held five meetings. In addition to the recurring agenda items, the Technology Committee also reviewed and discussed other matters in 2020.  Below table provides an overview of these topics. Review of technology programs In 2020, the Technology Committee's primary focus was the execution and implementation of technology programs in  EUV, DUV and Applications. The Technology Committee was informed on and discussed the key challenges and  opportunities from a business and technology development perspective. Furthermore ASML’s product roadmaps and the  alignment thereof with customers' roadmaps were reviewed and discussed in depth. The Technology Committee provided  the Supervisory Board with advice in this area. The Technology Committee was also provided with an overview of the  current portfolio of ASML’s Research department. It discussed the research activities that are being conducted in support  of the current product roadmaps as well as activities for the era ‘beyond High-NA’. On EUV, special attention was paid to  further improving the operational performance of the EUV systems and execution of the roadmaps that have been  defined. In Q2 the Technology Committee specifically focused on the developments and achievements in the field of High- NA. Special attention was paid to the accomplishments at Zeiss in the field of optics and interferometry. The Technology  Committee also discussed the value proposition of High-NA. With respect to DUV the focus was primarily on operational  excellence and improving competitiveness. In this respect the Technology Committee discussed the overall product  roadmap as well as the developments in the installed base management. On Applications, the developments on e-beam  metrology, computational lithography and patterning control were reviewed and discussed. In Q3 each Business Line  provided a complete overview of its roadmap in preparation of the strategy meeting of the full Supervisory Board. The  Technology Committee also discussed the technology targets and achievements related to our technology programs, and  provided the Remuneration Committee and the Supervisory Board with advice on this matter. The Technology Committee’s in-depth technology discussions and the subsequent reporting on the main points of these  discussions in the full Supervisory Board increases the Supervisory Board’s understanding of our technology  requirements. It also enables the Supervisory Board to adequately supervise the strategic choices we face, including our  investment in R&D. • Product Roadmap • Progress Technology Leadership Index Besides the Technology Committee members, the committee's  external and internal advisors regularly attended committee  meetings. The advisers do not have voting rights. Q2 • Business Line review: DUV • High-NA deep dive, incl. presentation from Zeiss Financial Statements and Profit Allocation The financial statements of ASML for the financial year 2020, as prepared by the Board of Management, have been  audited by KPMG Accountants N.V. All members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board have signed  these financial statements. We recommend to shareholders that they adopt the 2020 financial statements. We also recommend that our shareholders  adopt the Board of Management's proposal to make a final dividend payment of  €1.55  per ordinary share, which  together with the interim dividend of EUR 1.20 per ordinary share, leads to a total dividend of €2.75 per ordinary share in  respect of the 2020 financial year. Finally, we would like to extend a word of thanks to the Board of Management and all ASML employees for their continued  commitment and hard work during this challenging year. €21.8m  Total remuneration of the Board of Management Message from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee On behalf of the Remuneration Committee I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report, providing a summary of the  remuneration policies for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and an explanation about how they were  implemented in 2020. Summary of 2020 performance  We started 2020 with a positive view on the year for all the different markets. During the first quarter, the COVID-19  pandemic began to affect our business. We were not able to ship our systems to either Wuhan or California and we had to  ship EUV systems without Factory Acceptance Test (FAT). This resulted in delays in revenue recognition. On the full year we were able to execute our business activities with limited impact on our financials. Delayed revenue at  the start of the year could be recognized in later quarters and with the use of remote control activities, including  augmented reality, we were able to support our customers with the installs, upgrades and maintenance actions. We  continued to return capital to our shareholders by means of growing dividends and execution of our share buyback  program, which was paused in Q1 following the COVID-19 outbreak, but resumed in Q4, as part of our unchanged capital  return policy. Decisions made in 2020 In 2020, we finalized the review of the remuneration policies for the Board of Management and Supervisory Board to  ensure compliance with the revised EU Shareholders Rights Directive, following its implementation in Dutch law on  December 1, 2019. We submitted adjusted remuneration policies to the AGM in 2020. These adjusted policies did not  contain substantive changes to the remuneration structure or elements; main changes related to better explaining how the  Remuneration Policies encourage behavior that is focused on the long-term interests and sustainability of ASML. In this  process, the Supervisory Board and the Remuneration Committee, advised by an external remuneration expert, took into  account the level of support in society and considered the external environment ASML operates in, the relevant statutory  provisions and provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, competitive market practice as well as the guidance  issued by organizations representing institutional shareholders and input from ASML’s major shareholders. The Works  Council issued a positive advice in respect of the Remuneration Policies for the Board of Management and the  Supervisory Board. Both policies were adopted by the General Meeting on April 22, 2020. During the year we also monitored to what extent COVID-19 impacted ASML's business and financial performance and  we discussed the potential impact of the pandemic on remuneration. Given that ASML experienced only limited impact  from the global economic consequences of COVID-19, we decided to not make (temporary) adjustments to the  remuneration elements or policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking forward to 2021 During 2020, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the reference groups for Board of Management and Supervisory  Board remuneration and performed the recurring bi-annual benchmark reviews. Based on the outcome of those reviews,  we intend to submit proposals for implementing some adjustments to the Remuneration Policies for the Board of  Management and the Supervisory Board to the 2021 AGM.  The proposed adjustments will be set out in the convocation  documents for the 2021 AGM, which will be published in March 2021. This report describes how the Remuneration Policies of the Board  of Management and the Supervisory Board were implemented in 2020. 139.2% 146.5% Board of Management remuneration In this section of the Remuneration Report we provide an  overview of the Board of Management Remuneration  Policy which was adopted by the General Meeting on April  22, 2020 and applied as of January 1, 2020. It also  contains the details of the Board of Management  members' actual remuneration for the financial year 2020.  The Board of Management Remuneration Policy can be  found in the governance section of our website. Remuneration policy Remuneration as a strategic instrument The Board of Management Remuneration Policy supports  the long-term development and strategy of ASML in a  highly dynamic environment, while aiming to fulfill all  stakeholders’ requirements and maintaining an acceptable  risk profile. More than ever, the challenge for us is to drive  technology, to serve our customers and to satisfy our  stakeholders. These drivers are embedded in the identity,  mission and values of ASML and its affiliated enterprises  and are the backbone of the policy. The Supervisory Board  ensures that the policy and its implementation are linked to  ASML's objectives. The Remuneration Policy is designed to enable ASML to  attract, motivate and retain qualified industry professionals  for the Board of Management in order to define and  achieve our strategic goals. The policy acknowledges the  internal and external context as well as our business needs  and long-term strategy. The policy encourages behavior  that is focused on long-term value creation and the long- term interests and sustainability of ASML, while adopting  the highest standards of good corporate governance. It is  aimed at motivating for outstanding achievements, using a  combination of non-financial and financial performance  measures. Technology leadership and customer value  creation are the key drivers of sustainable returns to our  shareholders. Remuneration principles The remuneration philosophy that ASML applies for all its  employees includes the principle that ASML wants to pay  what is fair in the relevant labor market. The Supervisory  Board applies the same principle for the Board of Total direct compensation The remuneration levels are determined using the total direct compensation. Total direct compensation consists of a fixed  base salary and variable remuneration in the form of a short-term incentive (STI) and a long-term incentive (LTI). Other  remuneration elements are pension and expense reimbursements. Management of ASML and in doing so takes the pay and  employment conditions for the ASML employees into  account when formulating the remuneration policy. • Transparent – The policy and its execution are clear and  practical;   • Aligned – The Remuneration Policy is aligned with  the Short-term Incentive and/or Long-Term Incentive  policy for ASML senior management and other ASML  employees;   • Long-term – The incentives focus on long-term value  creation;   • Compliant – ASML adopts the highest standards of  good corporate governance; and   • Simple – The policy and its execution are as simple as  possible and easily understandable to all stakeholders. Reference group and market positioning Similar to the remuneration philosophy for all ASML  employees, we offer the Board of Management a  remuneration package that is competitive compared to a  relevant labor market. This market is defined by creating a  reference group of companies comparable to ASML in  terms of size and complexity, data transparency and  geographical area. The median market level serves as  reference point for determining the level of pay for the  Board of Management for as long as ASML is positioned  around the median of the reference group in terms of  company size (measured by enterprise value, revenue and  number of employees) and thus complexity. In principle, a benchmark is conducted every two years. To  ensure an appropriate composition of the relevant labor  market, the Supervisory Board reviews the composition of  the reference group at the time a benchmark is conducted.  Substantial changes applied to the composition of the  reference group will be proposed to the shareholders. In  the year without a market assessment, the Supervisory  Board considers the appropriateness of any change of  base salary in light of the market environment as well as  the salary adjustments for other ASML employees. Variable compensation The performance parameters are set by the Supervisory Board and consist of financial and qualitative measures in such a  way that an optimal balance is achieved between the various corporate objectives, both in the short term and the long  term. By doing so, it is ensured that the variable compensation contributes to the strategy, long-term interests and  sustainability of ASML. The Supervisory Board may adjust the performance measures and their relative weighting of the  variable income based on the rules and principles as outlined in the Remuneration Policy, if required by changed strategic  priorities in any given year. The Supervisory Board may use its the discretionary power to adjust the incentive pay-out  upward or downward  (‘ultimum remedium’). The following table represents the variable pay as percentage of base salary for the Presidents and the other Board of  Management members in the case of on-target performance. 20% 20% 60%  https://www.asml.com/rempolicy-bom Policy summary: • On-target levels as % of base salary • Presidents • Other members Board of Management 110% 100% • Performance measures (set annually, evaluated over 3-year period) Weight • ROAIC • Total shareholder return (TSR) vs Index • Technology Leadership Index • Sustainability 40% 30% 20% 10% • Pay-out levels TSR vs Index (TSR ASML–TSR PHLX Index (X.SOX)) % of target • Greater than or equal to 20% • 0 to 20% • -20 to 0% • Less than or equal to -20% 200% 100-200% 50-100% 0% • Pay-out levels ROAIC, Technology Leadership Index, Sustainability % of target • Maximum • Target • Threshold • Below threshold Remuneration Board of Management in 2020 The remuneration of the Board of Management for the financial year 2020 is based upon and complies with the  Remuneration Policy as further explained below. As such, the remuneration of the Board of Management in 2020  contributed to the objectives of the Remuneration Policy and, as a result, to ASML's strategy aimed at long-term value  creation. Scenario analyses of the possible outcomes of the variable remuneration components and their effect on the  remuneration of the Board of Management are conducted. Base Salary At the beginning of 2020 the Supervisory Board decided to increase the base salaries of the members of the Board of  Management by 2%, taking into account the market environment as well as the salary adjustments for other ASML  employees.  Short-Term Incentive The financial and non-financial target levels for the STI were set at the beginning of the 2020 financial year in accordance  with the Remuneration Policy and taking into account the annual plan for 2020, ensuring that targets are realistic, but  challenging. • Market Position, measuring ASML’s performance in the market, not only in terms of market share, but also customer  satisfaction and quality. • Technology Leadership Index, consisting of a set of targets related to ASML's product and technology roadmaps. It  measures the technological progress made by ASML over the relevant performance period, supporting our efforts to  drive innovation and thereby helping our customers achieve their goals and realize new technology and applications.  Both the STI and LTI make use of the Technology Leadership Index as a qualitative performance measure. The  objective is the same, but the applicable measures, targets and performance periods are different and aligned with  specific short- and long-term strategic priorities. In addition to the Technology Leadership Index and Market Position performance metrics, three financial performance  metrics were selected for the 2020 STI. Based on ASML's business challenges and circumstances in 2020, the  Supervisory Board chose the following three financial measures from the pre-defined list as included in the Remuneration  Policy: • EBIT Margin %, measuring Income from operations as percentage of revenues • EUV Gross Margin %, measuring Gross Profit as a percentage of revenues for EUV • Free Cash Flow, measuring Cash flow from operations minus purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment and  intangible fixed assets. After the end of the performance period, the Supervisory Board assessed the performance achieved against the targets, in  cooperation with the relevant subcommittees Technology Committee, Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee.  We do not disclose the exact actual target and achievement levels for the STI performance criteria, as these qualify as  commercially or strategically sensitive information, but in view of transparency, we report performance as follows: The total STI outcome results in a cash pay-out of €5.4 million, representing 111.3% of the base salary of the Board of  Management.  At the beginning of 2021, the Supervisory Board decided to apply the same three financial performance measures for  2021 as in the previous year: 1. EBIT Margin %, 2. EUV Gross Margin % and 3. Free Cash Flow. Market position 20% Between target and max Total 100% 139.2% STI Performance metric 2020 Weight Pay-out (as % of target) EBIT Margin % 20% 149.5% EUV Gross Margin % 20% 150.0% Free Cash Flow 20% 150.0% Technology Leadership Index 20% Between target and max • Total shareholder return vs. Index, measuring ASML's relative change in share price, plus dividends paid over the  relevant performance period. ASML's total shareholder return is compared to the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index,  a NASDAQ index designed to track the performance of a set of companies engaged in the design, distribution,  manufacture, and sale of semiconductors. • Return on Average Invested Capital (ROAIC), measuring ASML’s rate of return on capital it has put to work, regardless  of our capital structure. It is used as a fundamental metric to measure value creation of the company. The ROAIC is  calculated by dividing the Net Operating Profit After Tax by the Average Invested Capital.  • Technology Leadership Index, a qualitative measure which is also applied for the STI. Reference is made to the  description under STI. • Sustainability, a qualitative measure for determining our performance in the area of sustainability by benchmarking our  result from the annual comprehensive Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) against the best of the semiconductor  industry. This DJSI Assessment is a comprehensive assessment measuring our performance on more than 20 ESG  aspects. It allows us to benchmark our company performance in the wider field of ESG with our industry peers and  drive continuous improvement. Underlying is our Sustainability Strategy 2019-2025 containing a set of 16 KPIs and  targets, which we define by means of a comprehensive materiality assessment and input from continuous stakeholder  engagement. For more information see Non-financial statements - Materiality: assessing our impact. After the end of the three-year performance period 2018-2020, the Supervisory Board assessed the performance  achieved against the LTI targets, in cooperation with the Technology Committee, Audit Committee and Remuneration  Committee. For the LTI performance criteria, the actual target and achievement levels are not disclosed for the same  reason as mentioned under STI, with the exception of total shareholder return. We report performance as follows: The total LTI outcome results in a share vesting of 146.5% of target (73.3% of max). Grant 2020 At the beginning of 2020, 9,245 performance shares were conditionally granted to each of the two Presidents; the other  members of the Board of Management were each conditionally granted 5,718 performance shares. These conditional  grants are based on the maximum achievable opportunity. The targets levels related to the LTI performance measures ROAIC, Technology Leadership Index and Sustainability were  set at the beginning of 2020 for the performance period 2020-2022. This was done taking into account the long-term  product roadmap, sustainability goals and the long-term financial plan, thereby ensuring alignment between the various  targets and ASML’s long-term strategic priorities and encouraging behavior focused on long-term value creation. Other remuneration In 2020, the Board of Management members participated in the pension arrangement for the Board of Management,  which is based on the ‘excedent’ (supplementary) arrangement for our employees in the Netherlands, a defined  contribution opportunity as defined in Dutch fiscal regulations. It consist of a gross pension element (for the salary below  approximately 110,000 euro) and a net pension element (for the salary above 110,000 euro). Some members opted out of  the net pension due to different tax treatment of this outside the Netherlands. Details on the incurred accounting expenses  relating to the application of the pension arrangement in 2020 can be found in the table Total Remuneration Board of  Management. Expenses reimbursed by ASML in 2020 included company car costs, travel expenses, representation allowances, housing  costs, social security costs, and health and disability insurance costs. Share ownership guidelines All members of the Board of Management complied with the share ownership guidelines as incorporated in the  Remuneration Policy. Sustainability 10% 183.5% Total 100% 146.5% LTI Performance metric 2018-2020 Weight Pay-out (as % of target) Total Shareholder Return 30% 200.0% ROAIC 40% 88.4% Technology Leadership Index 20% 164.2% The remuneration reported as part of the LTI (share awards) is based on costs incurred under US GAAP and EU-IFRS. The  costs of share awards are charged to the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the 3-year vesting period based on  the number of awards expected to vest. For the first 2 years, we apply the maximum achievable number of share awards,  and in the final performance year of the awards we update this estimate for the non-market performance conditions to the  best estimated amounts which are anticipated to vest. Any difference between the amount based on the best estimate of  achievable number of shares awards and the amount based on the actual number of share awards that vest, is taken into  account in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the financial year in which the share awards vest. The LTI (share awards) remuneration reported for the year 2020 includes a release for the 2018 performance share plan  based on the actual number of share awards vesting early 2021. The release is as follows: Mr. Wennink: €772,357; Mr. van  den Brink: €772,357; Mr. van Hout: €443,710; Mr. Schneider-Maunoury: €443,840; Mr. Dassen: €281,317; Mr. Fouquet:  €361,691. The Supervisory Board applied an upward adjustment for the pay-out related to the ROAIC performance metric of the  2018-2020 LTI plan. This adjustment is made to correct for the effects of higher than anticipated investments in R&D and  CAPEX since target setting. The increase in investments is mainly needed to meet customer development roadmaps for  High-NA and as such supports long-term value creation of ASML and our stakeholders. The pay-out changed from  111.2% to 146.5%. The upward adjustments are as follows: Mr. Wennink: 2,307 shares for €369,050; Mr. van den Brink:  2,307 shares for €369,050; Mr. Van Hout: 1,326 shares for €212,017; Mr. Schneider-Maunoury: 1,326 shares for €212,087;  Mr. Dassen: 773 shares for €140,560; Mr. Fouquet: 994 shares for €180,720. Amounts involved are based on the number  of extra vested shares multiplied with the share price at grant date adjusted for the number of service days until vesting in  2021. The modified vesting conditions have been taken into account in the adjustment. The net impact in the 2020 Consolidated Statements of Operations is a release of: Mr. Wennink: €403,307; Mr. Van den  Brink: €403,307; Mr. Van Hout: €231,693, Mr. Schneider-Maunoury: €231,753; Mr. Dassen: €140,757; Mr. Fouquet:  €180,971.

These apply to each member of the  Board of Management. The remuneration of the R.J.M. Dassen and C.D. Fouquet is lower in 2018 as they were appointed as members of the Board of Management during 2018. The table set out above aims to provide insight into the Company's performance over the past five years and the  development of the remuneration. The metrics sales, net income and share price are used to measure company  performance, as they are key metrics serving as a good proxy for ASML's general performance, as well as in view of  comparability with other companies. The Company has grown significantly over the last years, not only reflected in the  number of employees but also in terms of revenue. Since 2016, net sales increased by 103%. The performance of the  Company in that same period has increased significantly as well, reflected for example in Net Income (125% growth since  2016 based on EU-IFRS) and Total Shareholder Return (273% growth). As the table shows, the company performance  over the last five years has improved more significantly compared to the development of remuneration in that same  period. The size of the company (measured by enterprise value, revenue and number of employees) is taken into account  in determining the group of reference companies that are used for the benchmark to assess the competitiveness of the  Board of Management remuneration compared to the labor market. This has led to revisions of the Board of Management  remuneration policy in 2017 and 2019, resulting into higher base salaries as well as higher levels of STI (at target) and LTI  (at target). Actual remuneration may fluctuate year over year depending on actual STI pay-out in any year, as well as the  vesting of performance shares (LTI) in any year and the share price at that moment.

The number  of performance shares to be conditionally awarded is calculated using the volume-weighted  average share price during the last quarter of the year preceding the conditional award. Lock-up period: The minimum holding period is two years after the vesting date. Upon termination of contract the transfer restrictions will remain in place  during the holding period except in case of decease. In case a tax payment is due by the members of the Board of Management over  the retrieved variable income, performance shares may be partially sold at vesting  (‘sell to cover’) in accordance with the law and internal regulations. The internal pay ratio1 (CEO versus employee remuneration) remained stable 40:1 in 2020 (2019 41:1) after the reset  performed in 2019.  ASML intends to grant competitive remuneration to employees at all position levels within the  Company. At each level remuneration should reflect the responsibilities of the role. The build-up of remuneration from level  to level should therefore be gradual and in line with increasing responsibilities, also following market practice. At the  highest level the steps become gradually bigger as responsibilities ultimately rise from a divisional level to an overall  company level. The Supervisory Board considers the current build-up and the overall pay ratio of 40:1 to be equitable,  considering the current size and organization structure of the company. This ratio consists of the CEO's total remuneration during 2020 of €4,564 thousand, compared to the average remuneration of all employees. The average  remuneration of all employees was calculated using the average number of payroll employees in FTE (wages and salaries + pension and retirement expenses + share- based payments) / average number of payroll employees = €2,756 million / 24,727 = €113 thousand. This ratio is prepared in accordance with the Dutch Corporate  Governance Code and has not been prepared to comply the Pay Ratio Disclosure requirements under SEC regulations. Remuneration Supervisory Board In this section of the Remuneration Report we provide an overview of the Supervisory Board's Remuneration Policy as  adopted by the General Meeting on April 22, 2020 and as in force as of April 1, 2020. It also provides the details of the  Supervisory Board members' actual remuneration in 2020. The Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board can be  found in the Governance section of our website. Remuneration Policy Remuneration objectives and principles The remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board is designed to enable ASML to attract and retain qualified Supervisory  Board members, which together compose a diverse and balanced Supervisory Board with the appropriate level of skills,  competences and experience required to properly supervise (the execution of) ASML's strategy, which is focused on the  creation of long-term value for all stakeholders. • Transparent – The remuneration policy and its execution are clear and practical  • Alignment – The remuneration policy is benchmarked to market practice  • Compliant – ASML adopts the highest standards of good corporate governance  • Simple – The remuneration policy and its execution are as simple as possible and easily understandable to all  stakeholders  • Fair – The remuneration should reflect the time spent and the responsibilities of the role of the members of the  Supervisory Board  • Independent – The remuneration of a Supervisory Board member may not be made dependent on the results of the  company. Reference group and market positioning  The remuneration of the Supervisory Board should be competitive compared to a relevant reference market. This market  is defined using a reference group of companies with a two-tier board structure listed on the AEX Index of Euronext  Amsterdam. To determine the positioning in this group, enterprise value, revenue and number of employees are taken into  account. Summary of Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board  The table below provides an overview and description of the elements of the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory  Board. No shares and options have been granted to the current and former members of the Supervisory Board during the last five  years.

No (personal) loans have been granted to the members of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board and no  guarantees or the like have been granted in favor of any of the members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory  Board. No severance payments were granted to members of the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board in 2020 and  no variable remuneration has been clawed-back. Derogation In 2020 no deviations took place from the decision-making process for the implementation of the Remuneration Policies  for the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board and no temporary deviations took place from the Remuneration  Policies.  Shareholder voting At the 2020 AGM the 2020 Remuneration Policy for the Board of Management was adopted with 95% of the votes cast in  favor. The Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board was also adopted at the 2020 AGM with a majority of 99.47% of  the votes cast in favor of the proposal. The Remuneration Report for the financial year 2019 was submitted to the 2020 AGM for an advisory vote. 93.78% of the  votes were cast in favor. As a result there are no specific topics to be addressed in this Remuneration Report. This Remuneration Report will be submitted to the 2021 AGM for an advisory vote in line with Dutch law. To the Shareholders and the Supervisory Board ASML Holding N.V.: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial  Statements and Internal Control Over  Financial Reporting  We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance  sheets of ASML Holding N.V. and subsidiaries (the  “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the  related consolidated statements of operations,  comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash  flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended  December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the  “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited  the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as  of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in  Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by  the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the  Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements  referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the  financial position of the Company as of December 31,  2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its  cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period  ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S.  generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our  opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,  effective internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in  Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by  the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the  Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions  The Company’s management is responsible for these  consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective  internal control over financial reporting, and for its  assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over  financial reporting, included in the accompanying  Management’s report on internal control over financial  reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company’s consolidated financial statements and an  opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial  reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting  firm registered with the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are  required to be independent with respect to the Company in  accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the  applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and  Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards  of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the consolidated financial statements are free of  material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and  whether effective internal control over financial reporting  was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements  included performing procedures to assess the risks of  material misstatement of the consolidated financial  statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing  procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the  amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial  statements. Our audits also included evaluating the  accounting principles used and significant estimates made  by management, as well as evaluating the overall  presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our  audit of internal control over financial reporting included  obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial  reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness  exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed  risk. Our audits also included performing such other  procedures as we considered necessary in the  circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a  reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal  Control Over Financial Reporting  A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance  regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the  preparation of financial statements for external purposes in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to  the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as  necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are  being made only in accordance with authorizations of  management and directors of the company; and (3) provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely  detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of  the company’s assets that could have a material effect on  the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over  financial reporting may not prevent or detect  misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of  effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that  controls may become inadequate because of changes in  conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the  policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matter  The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter  arising from the current period audit of the consolidated  financial statements that was communicated or required to  be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)  relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the  consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our  especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter  in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial  statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by  communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a  separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the  accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Complex revenue recognition due to the identification of  distinct performance obligations and allocation of the total  contract consideration. As disclosed in note 3 to the consolidated financial  statements, net system sales was EUR 10,317 million for  the 12 months ended December 31, 2020. Sales of  systems are usually entered into with customers under  Volume Purchase Agreements (VPAs). These VPAs usually  contain multiple performance obligations, for example  delivery of goods, installation, warranty and training. Once  these performance obligations are identified, the total  contract consideration, including discounts, offer of free  goods or services and credits that can be used towards  future purchases, is allocated to the performance  obligations.  We identified complex revenue recognition relating to the  identification of performance obligations in the contracts as  well as the allocation of the total contract consideration,  including discounts, offer of free goods or services and  credits that can be used towards future purchases, as a  critical audit matter since it is inherently judgmental and  results in complex accounting. As a result, evaluating the  Company’s judgments regarding the identified  performance obligations, including the estimate of the  number of systems to be delivered, and the allocation of  the total contract consideration to these performance  obligations required a high degree of auditor judgment. The following are the primary procedures we performed to  address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design  and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal  controls related to the critical matter. This includes controls  related to VPA contract assessment for the identification of  performance obligations and the allocation of the total  contract consideration to these performance obligations,  and the correct application of these on individual sales  transactions. We evaluated the identification of  performance obligations by inspecting a selection including  significant VPAs and their supporting documentation.  Furthermore, we evaluated a sample of individual sales  transactions by inspecting their related supporting  documentation, we performed sensitivity analysis to  assess the estimated number of systems to be delivered,  assessed changes in estimates throughout the year by  inspecting related supporting documentation, and  performed inquiries with different levels of the organization.  Finally, we checked the accuracy of the Company’s model  used to allocate the contract consideration to the identified  performance obligations. /s/ KPMG Accountants N.V.

ASML’s principal operations are in the  Netherlands, the US and Asia. Our shares are listed for trading in the form of registered shares on Euronext Amsterdam and on NASDAQ. The principal  trading market of our ordinary shares is Euronext Amsterdam. Basis of preparation  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are stated in millions of euros unless indicated otherwise. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP. Use of estimates  The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities on the balance sheet dates, and the reported amounts of net sales and costs during the reported  periods. The inputs into our estimates and assumptions consider the economic implications of COVID-19 on our critical  accounting estimates. We believe that the critical accounting estimates and assumptions are appropriate in light of the  increased uncertainties surrounding the severity and duration of the impact of COVID-19. ASML will continue to monitor  the impacts of COVID-19 and incorporate them into accounting estimates. Actual results could differ from those  estimates. We evaluate our estimates continuously and we base our estimates on historical experience and on various  other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these  estimates if the assumptions prove incorrect. To the extent there are material differences between actual results and these  estimates, our future results could be materially and adversely affected. We believe that the accounting policies described  below require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial  Statements. Our most critical accounting estimates include: Principles of consolidation  The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Financial Statements of ASML Holding N.V. and all of its subsidiaries.  Subsidiaries are all entities over which ASML controls the financial and operating activities, generally accompanying a  shareholding of more than 50.0% of the outstanding voting rights. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on  which control is obtained by ASML. The Company consolidates Berliner Glas using a one-quarter lag, to allow for the  timely preparation of consolidated financial information. There were no significant intervening events during this lag period  that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements. All intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized  results on transactions with subsidiaries are eliminated. We also assess if we are the primary beneficiary of, and thus  would consolidate, any variable interest entity. Foreign currency translation  The financial information for subsidiaries outside the euro-zone is measured using a mix of local currencies or the euro as  the functional currency. The Financial Statements of those foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros in the preparation  of ASML’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Assets and liabilities are translated into euros at the exchange rate on the  respective balance sheet dates, with the resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly in shareholders’ equity.  Income and costs are translated into euros based on the average exchange rate for the corresponding period. New US GAAP accounting pronouncements adopted  During 2020, there were no new US GAAP accounting pronouncements that were adopted which have a material impact  on our Consolidated Financial Statements. New US GAAP accounting pronouncements issued but not adopted  For the year ended December 31, 2020, there are no new US GAAP accounting pronouncements which have not yet been  adopted and are expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On October 30, 2020, we concluded the acquisition of Berliner Glas and obtained control through acquiring 100% of the  issued share capital of Berliner Glas, for a total consideration of €257.1 million, of which €3.9 million relates to contingent  consideration to be paid in cash in 2021. Berliner Glas is one of the world’s leading providers of optical key components, assemblies and systems, high-quality  refined technical glass as well as glass touch assemblies. Berliner Glas is headquartered in Berlin and has facilities  at five locations throughout Germany, Switzerland and China. With the acquisition of Berliner Glas, we acquired technical capabilities that are critical to secure the future roadmap for  our EUV and DUV products and will provide increased value to ASML's customers. The following table summarizes the major classes of consideration transferred, and the recognized amounts of the fair  value of the identifiable assets distributed and the fair value of the liabilities incurred or assumed at the acquisition date. The gross contractual amount for accounts receivable due is €21.6 million, of which €0.3 million is expected to be  uncollectible. The Accrued and other liabilities include a net pension liability of €14.8 million for a defined benefit pension plan in  Switzerland. For details see Note 19 Employee benefits. Prior to the acquisition, supply and investment arrangements existed between Berliner Glas and ASML. These pre-existing  relationships were effectively settled as a result of the acquisition. We determined that the supply arrangements as well as  the investment arrangement were at current market terms and therefore no gain or loss was recognized. In addition, the  consideration has not been adjusted for the settlement of the pre-existing relationships between ASML and Berliner Glas.  The total net identifiable assets of €169.2 million include a net liability to ASML of €9.6 million, which is eliminated in the  Consolidated Balance Sheets. Business Combinations ASML ANNUAL REPORT 2020 155 Total net identifiable assets 169.2 Total consideration transferred 257.1 Goodwill on acquisition 87.9 Accounts payable 13.1 Long-term debt, current and non-current 55.5 Deferred and other tax liabilities 16.5 Accrued and other liabilities, current and non-current 40.2 Other liabilities assumed 17.6 Liabilities assumed 142.9 €, in millions October 30, 2020 Cash and cash equivalents 30.3 Accounts receivable, net 21.3 Inventories, net 83.4 Other assets 8.2 Deferred tax assets 4.6 Intangible assets, net 32.3 Property, plant and equipment, net 125.1 Right of use assets - Finance 6.9 Assets acquired 312.1 Accounting Policy  Acquisitions of subsidiaries are included on the basis of the acquisition method. The cost of acquisition is measured  based on the consideration transferred at fair value, the fair value of identifiable assets distributed and the fair value  of liabilities incurred or assumed at the acquisition date (i.e. the date which we obtain control). Goodwill is capitalized  as the excess of the costs of an acquired subsidiary, net of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired and  liabilities incurred or assumed. Acquisition-related costs are expensed when incurred in the period they arise or the  service is received. The majority of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Berliner Glas is attributable to the fact that the acquisition will help  us achieve our strategic objective to secure the ramp-up and roll-out of future lithography systems. All goodwill has been allocated to the ASML reporting unit. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible  for income tax purposes. The operating results of Berliner Glas are recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations using a  one-quarter time lag. Therefore, the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 do not  include any operating results of Berliner Glas for the period between the date of acquisition and December 31, 2020.  Additionally, Berliner Glas balance sheet information included in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of  December 31, 2020 is as of the acquisition date. In 2020, we incurred €5.4 million transaction costs relating to the acquisition of Berliner Glas. These costs are included in  SG&A. The following unaudited pro forma summary presents estimated consolidated information of ASML as if the Berliner Glas  acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2019. These amounts have been calculated after applying our accounting policies  and adjusting the results of Berliner Glas to reflect the charges and benefits assuming the fair value adjustments had been  applied from January 1, 2019 with the consequential tax effects. Pro forma 2019 net income was adjusted to include €18.6 million of non-recurring costs related to the fair value adjustments to acquisition date inventory, €2.3 million  of amortization charges related to the fair value adjustments to acquisition date intangibles as well as €5.4 million of acquisition-related costs incurred in 2020. 2. Pro forma 2020 net income was adjusted to exclude €5.4 million of non-recurring acquisition-related costs incurred and to include €2.3 million of amortization charges  related to the fair value adjustments to acquisition date intangibles. Revenue from contracts with customers Unaudited Unaudited Pro forma year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2019 2020 Total net sales 11,952.3 14,107.2 Net income 1,2 2,572.9 3,567.2 Accounting Policy  We measure revenue based on the consideration specified in the contracts with our customers, adjusted for any  significant financing components, and excluding any taxes collected on behalf of third parties. We recognize revenue  when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a good or service to our customer. We bill our  customers for, and recognize as revenue, any charges for shipping and handling costs. Depending on the contract, we obtain a right to payment for our systems through a combination of either a  reservation of a production slot or upon delivery of our systems, with the remaining portion upon final acceptance of  our systems. Right to payment for our service and field options occurs upon shipment or completion of the service  unless described otherwise. The payment term is typically due 15-45 days after the aforementioned events. Our  contracts typically include cancellation penalties that provide economic protection from the risk of customer  cancellation. The costs related to our sales are recognized as cost of sales. We generate revenue from the sale of integrated patterning solutions for the semiconductor industry, which mainly  consist of systems, system related options and upgrades, other holistic lithography solutions and customer services.  The main portion of our net sales is derived from volume purchase agreements with our customers that have  multiple performance obligations, which mainly include the sale of our systems, system related options, installation,  training and extended and enhanced (optic) warranty. In our volume purchase agreements we offer customers  discounts in the normal course of sales negotiations. As part of these volume purchases agreements, we may also  offer free goods or services and credits that can be used towards future purchases. Occasionally, systems, with the  related extended and enhanced (optic) warranties, installation and training services, are ordered individually. Our  sales agreements do not include a right of return for any reason other than not meeting the agreed upon  specifications. For bundled packages, we account for individual goods and services as separate and distinct performance  obligations, including the free or discounted goods or services, if a product or service is separately identifiable from  other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are  readily available to the customer.  The consideration paid for our performance obligations is typically fixed, unless specifically noted in the nature of the  performance obligations. Most of our volume purchase agreements with customers contain some component of  variable consideration, typically dependent on the final volume of systems ordered by the customer. Variable  consideration is estimated at contract inception for each performance obligation based on communications with the customer to understand their requirements and roadmap. We subsequently updated each quarter, using either the  expected value method or most likely amount method, whichever is determined to best predict the consideration to  be collected from the customer. Variable consideration is only included in the transaction price if it is considered  probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur. In certain scenarios when entering into a volume purchase  agreement, free goods or services are provided directly or through a voucher that can be used on future contracts.  Consideration from the contract will be allocated to these performance obligations and revenue recognized when  control transfers based on the nature of the goods or services provided. Some of our contracts require our customers to pay a down payment on systems to be shipped. We do not record a  significant financing component for down payments as the timing difference between the promised consideration  and the cash selling price arises from other reasons than financing. The total consideration of the contract is allocated between all distinct performance obligations in the contract based  on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on other stand-alone sales  that are directly observable, when possible. However, for the majority of our performance obligations these are not  available. If no directly observable evidence is available, the stand-alone selling price is determined using the  adjusted market assessment approach, which requires judgment. Options to buy goods or services in addition to the purchase commitment are assessed to determine if they provide  a material right to the customer that they would not have received if they had not entered into this contract. Each  option to buy additional goods or services provided at a discount from the stand-alone selling price is considered a  material right. The discount offered from the stand-alone selling price will be allocated from the consideration of the  other goods and services in the contract if it is determined the customer will exercise the option to buy, adjusted for  the likelihood. Revenue will be recognized in line with the nature of the related goods or services. If it is subsequently  determined the customer will not exercise the option to buy, or the option expires, revenue will be recognized. Occasionally we may enter into a bill-and-hold transaction where we invoice a customer for a system that is ready  for delivery but not shipped to the customer until a later date, based on customer’s request. Transfer of control is  determined to have occurred only when there is a substantive reason for the arrangement, the system is separately  identified as belonging to the customer, the good has been accepted by the customer and is ready for delivery, and  we do not have the ability to direct the use of the system. We generate revenue from lessor agreements, which we classify as a sales-type lease when the lease meets any of  the following criteria at lease commencement:    • The lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee by the end of the lease term;   • The lease grants the lessee an option to purchase the underlying asset, that the lessee is reasonably certain to  exercise;   • The lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset. However, if the  commencement date falls at or near the end of the economic life of the underlying asset, this criterion shall not be  used for purposes of classifying the lease;   • The present value of the sum of the lease payments and any residual value guaranteed by the lessee that is not  already reflected in the lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset;  or   • The underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at  the end of the lease term. Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are transferred to the lessee  are classified as sales-type lease arrangements. If we have offered the customer a sales-type  lease arrangement,  revenue is recognized at commencement of the lease term. The difference between the gross finance receivable  and the present value of the minimum lease payments is initially recognized as unearned interest and presented  as a deduction to the gross finance receivable. Interest income is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of  Operations  over the term of the lease contract using the effective interest method. Leases whereby all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not transferred to the lessee are classified  as operating lease arrangements. If we have offered the customer an operating lease arrangement, the system  is included in property, plant and equipment upon commencement of the lease. Revenue from operating lease  arrangements is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations  on a straight-line basis over the term of  the lease contract. New systems (established  technologies) New systems sales include i-line, KrF, ArF, ArFi and EUV related systems, along with the related factory  options ordered with the base system, as well as metrology and inspection systems.   Prior to shipment, the majority of our systems undergo a Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) in our cleanroom  facilities, effectively replicating the operating conditions that will be present on the customer’s site, in  order to verify whether the system meets its standard specifications and any additional technical and  performance criteria agreed with the customer. A system is shipped only after all contractual specifications  are met or discrepancies from agreed upon specifications are waived and customer sign-off is received for  delivery. Each system’s performance is re-tested through a Site Acceptance Test (SAT) after installation at  the customer site. We have never failed to successfully complete installation of a system at a customer’s  premises; therefore, acceptance at FAT is considered to be proven for established technologies with a  history of successful customer acceptances at SAT (equal or better than FAT).    New system sales do not meet the requirements for over time revenue recognition because our customers  do not simultaneously receive and or consume the benefits provided by our performance or control the  asset throughout any stage of our production process, as well as the systems are considered to have  alternative use. Used systems We have no repurchase commitments in our general sales terms and conditions, however from time to  time we repurchase systems that we have manufactured and sold and, following refurbishment, will resell  to other customers. This repurchase decision is mainly driven by market demand expressed by other  customers and less frequently by explicit or implicit contractual arrangements relating to the initial sale. We  consider reasonable offers from any vendor, including customers, to repurchase used systems that we can  refurbish, resell, and install as part of our normal business operations. New product introduction We sell new products and services, which are evolutions of our existing technologies. If installation  is determined not to be a separate performance or if there is not a sufficient established history of  acceptance on FAT, the product is determined to be a “new product introduction”. Installation Installation is provided within the selling price of a system. Installation is considered to be distinct as it  does not significantly modify the system being purchased and the customer or a third party could be  capable of performing the installation themselves, if desired. Transfer of control takes place over the period  of installation from delivery through SAT, measured on a straight-line basis, as our performance is satisfied  evenly over this period of time. Transfer of control of a system undergoing FAT, and recognition of revenue related to this system, will  occur upon delivery of the system.  Transfer of control of a system not undergoing a FAT, and recognition of revenue related to this system, will  occur upon customer acceptance of the system at SAT. Transfer of control of a used system, and recognition of revenue, follow the same logic as for our “New  systems (established technologies)”. Field upgrades and options mainly relate to goods and services that are delivered for systems already  installed in the customer factories. Certain upgrades require significant installation efforts, enhancing  an asset the customer controls, therefore resulting in transfer of control over the period of installation,  measured using the cost incurred method which is estimated using labor hours, as this best depicts  the satisfaction of our obligation in transferring control. For the options and other upgrades for which  the customer receives and consumes the benefit at the moment of delivery, the transfer of control and  recognition of revenue will occur upon delivery. As long as we are not able to make a reliable estimate of the total efforts needed to complete the upgrade,  we only recognize revenue to cover costs incurred. Margin will be realized at the earlier of us being able to  make a reliable estimate or completion of the upgrade. New product introductions are typically newly developed options to be used within our systems. Transfer  of control and revenue recognition for new product introductions occurs upon after successful installation  and customer acceptance at SAT. Once there is an established history of successful installation and  customer acceptance, revenue will be recognized consistent with other systems and goods after transfer  of control. As long as we are not able to make a reliable estimate of the total efforts needed to complete the  installation, we only recognize revenue to cover costs incurred. Margin will be realized at the earlier of us  being able to make a reliable estimate or installation completion. Warranties We provide standard warranty coverage on our systems for 12 months and on certain optic parts for 60  months, providing labor and non-consumable parts necessary to repair our systems during these warranty  periods. These standard warranties cannot be purchased and do not provide a service in addition to  the general assurance the system will perform as promised. As a result, no revenue is allocated to these  standard warranties. Time-based licenses and  related service Time-based licenses relate to software licenses and the related service which are sold for a period of  time. The licenses and the related service are not considered to be individually distinct as the support  services are integral to the customer’s ability to continue to use the software license in the rapidly changing  technological environment. The transfer of control takes place over the license term, measured on a  straight-line basis, as our performance is satisfied evenly over this period of time. Payments are made in  installments throughout the license term. Application projects Application projects are node transition and consulting projects which at times may be provided as free  service within a volume purchase agreement. Measuring satisfaction of this performance obligation is  performed through an input method based on the labor hours expended relative to the estimated total  labor hours as this best depicts the transfer of control of these kind of services. Service contracts Service contracts are entered into with our customers to support our systems used in their ongoing  operations during the systems lifecycle, typically in the form of full-service agreements, limited manpower  agreements, other labor agreements, parts availability or parts usage agreements. These services are  typically for a specified period of time. Control transfers over this period of time, measured on a straight- line basis, as these are stand-ready obligations, with an exception for the labor hour pool service contracts  for which we recognize revenue in line with invoicing, using the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18.  Invoicing is typically performed monthly or quarterly throughout the service period. Billable parts and labor Billable labor represents maintenance services to our systems installed in the customer’s factories while  in operation, through purchase orders from our customer. Control over these services is transferred to the  customer upon receipt of customer sign-off. OnPulse Maintenance OnPulse maintenance services are provided over a specified period of time on our light source systems.  Payment is determined by the amount of pulses counted from each light source system, which is variable.  Invoicing is monthly based on the pulses counted. Revenue is recognized in line with invoicing using the  practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18. Field projects (relocations) Field projects represent mainly relocation services. Measuring satisfaction of this performance obligation  is performed through an input method based on the labor hours expended relative to the estimated total  labor hours as this best depicts the transfer of control of our service. Both the extended and enhanced (optic) warranties on our systems are accounted for as a separate  performance obligation, with transfer of control taking place over the warranty period, measured on a  straight-line basis, as this is a stand-ready obligation. As long as we are not able to make a reliable estimate of the total efforts needed to complete these kind  of projects, we only recognize revenue to cover costs incurred. Margin will be realized at the earlier of us  being able to make a reliable estimate or project completion. Billable parts represent spare parts including optical components relating to our systems installed in the  customer’s factories while in operation, through purchase orders from our customer. Billable parts can be: • Sold as direct spare parts, for which control transfers upon delivery; or • Sold as part of maintenance services, where control transfers upon receipt of customer sign-off. Disaggregation of revenue  Our revenue from contracts with customers, on a disaggregated basis, aligns with our reportable segment disclosures  with the addition of disaggregation of net system sales per technology and per end-use.

The contract assets are transferred to the receivables when the receivables become unconditional. The  contract liabilities primarily relate to remaining performance obligations for which consideration has been received such as  down payments received for systems to be delivered, as well as deferred revenue from system shipments, based on the  allocation of the consideration to the related performance obligations in the contract. This deferred revenue mainly  consists of extended and enhanced warranties, installation and free goods or services provided as part of a volume  purchase agreement. The majority of our customer contracts contain both asset and liability positions. At the end of each reporting period,  these positions are netted on a contract basis and presented as either an asset or a liability in the Consolidated Balance  Sheets. Consequently, a contract balance can change between periods from a net contract asset balance to a net  contract liability balance in the balance sheet. Significant changes in the contract assets and the contract liabilities balances during the periods are as follows. The increase in the net contract liability to €5,474.9 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to €4,055.0 million as  of December 31, 2019 is mainly driven by the recognition of down payments for systems which will be shipped in the  future. Cumulative catch-up adjustments recognized in our current year revenue are due to updated estimates for system  volume, discounts and credits included in our volume purchase agreements. Remaining performance obligations  Our customers generally commit to purchase systems, service, or field options through separate sales orders and service  contracts. Typically the terms and conditions of these sales orders come from volume purchase agreements with our  customers which can cover up to 5 years. The revenues for each committed performance obligation are estimated based  on the terms and conditions agreed through the volume purchase agreements.  When revenues will be recognized is mainly dependent on when systems are shipped or installed, as well as when service  projects and field upgrades are performed and completed. All of which is estimated based on contract terms and  communication with our customers, including the customer facility readiness to take delivery of our goods or services. The  volume purchase agreements may be subject to modifications, impacting the amount and timing of revenue recognition  for the anticipated revenues. As of December 31, 2020 the remaining performance obligations amount to €15.1 billion (December 31, 2019: €13.2  billion). We estimate 76% (December 31, 2019: 55%) of these anticipated revenues are expected to be recognized during  the next 12 months. The remaining anticipated revenues mainly include orders related to EUV system sales and our next- generation EUV platform, High-NA, which are planned to be shipped in 2022 or later. Segment disclosure ASML has one reportable segment, for the development, production, marketing, sales, upgrading and servicing of  advanced semiconductor equipment systems, consisting of lithography, metrology and inspection systems. Its operating  results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to make decisions about resource allocation  and assess performance. Management reporting includes net system sales figures of new and used systems, sales per technology and sales per  end-use. For the sales per technology and end-use, see Note 3 Revenue from contracts with customers.

Long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic location in which these assets are located. In 2019 and 2020, 3 customers exceed more than 10% of total net sales, in 2020 totaling €9,946.5 million, or 71.2%, of  total net sales (2019: €8,018.1 million, or 67.8%). In 2018, 4 customers exceed more than 10% of total net sales, totaling  €7,931.4 million, or 72.5%. Our three largest customers (based on total net sales) accounted for €2,757.0 million, or  80.1%, of accounts receivable and finance receivables at December 31, 2020, compared with €2,191.8 million, or 77.2%,  at December 31, 2019.

The Logic sector continued to be strong in  2020, and was the largest consumer of our most advanced EUV systems as well. Memory demand picked up in 2020  after a decline in 2019.  South Korea saw the largest geographic sales growth in support of expanding capacity in Foundry  and DRAM production lines. In Q4 2020, 2 systems have been moved into storage on our premises after completion, through a long-term storage  arrangement with a customer. For both systems we have recognized revenue as a bill-and-hold transaction since control  has transferred to the customer. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments The cash and cash equivalents and short term investments increased €2.6 billion mainly driven by an increase in Net  income, an increase in down payments from customers and proceeds from the issuance of notes. The deposits with financial institutions, governments and government related bodies and investments in money market  funds have an investment grade credit rating. Our cash and cash equivalents are predominantly denominated in euros and  partly in US dollars. As of December 31, 2020, no restrictions on usage of cash and cash equivalents exist (2019: no restrictions). The carrying  amount of these assets approximates their fair value. Year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2019 2020 Deposits with financial institutions, governments and government related bodies 434.8 1,545.3 Investments in money market funds 2,139.7 3,841.9 Bank accounts 957.8 662.2 Cash and cash equivalents 3,532.3 6,049.4 Deposits with financial institutions, governments and government related bodies 1,185.8 1,302.2 Short-term investments 1,185.8 1,302.2 Accounting Policy  Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments, such as bank deposits, deposits with  governments and government related bodies, money market funds and bank accounts readily convertible to known  amounts of cash with insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities to the entity holding the investments of 3  months or less at the date of acquisition. Investments with original maturities to the entity holding the investments longer than 3 months and 1 year or less at  the date of acquisition are presented as short-term investments. Other than temporary fair value changes in these  investments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Short-term investments have insignificant  interest rate risk. Accounts receivable, net The decrease in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 is due to an increase in  factoring of our accounts receivable, partly offset by an increase in our sales. In 2020, receivables have been sold through factoring arrangements for cash totaling €2.2 billion (2019: €1.3 billion). The  amounts consist of €1.4 billion (2019: €0.6 billion) regular trade receivables and €0.8 billion (2019: €0.7 billion) absolute,  unconditional, irrevocable accounts receivable for down payments on systems to be shipped in 2021. The total amount  sold has been derecognized since the asset is isolated from the seller, control is transferred to the buyer and there are no  restrictions on the buyer related to the factored items. The fair value of the receivables sold was substantially the same as  their carrying value. The transfer is treated as an operating cash flow within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Finance receivables, net The increase in finance receivables as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 is the result of providing  additional systems with a free-use period, to support the capacity ramp-up of high-end systems which are part of the  early-insertion lifecycle of the technology. Additionally, we delivered some of our newest DUV systems to customers with  the right to use and evaluate the new technology during a free-use period, and it is expected they will be purchased at the  end of the free-use period. Gross profit recognized at the commencement date of the lease for our sales-type leases amounts to €830.2 million  during 2020 (2019: €343.9 million; 2018: €446.5 million). Interest income for our sales-type leases in 2020 amounts to €6.2  million (2019: €4.7 million; 2018: €4.9 million).

The carrying amount of the accounts receivable approximates the fair value. We perform ongoing  credit evaluations on our customers’ financial condition. We periodically review whether an allowance for credit  losses is needed by considering factors such as historical payment experience, credit quality, aging of the accounts  receivable balances, expected lifetime losses, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability  to pay. When entering into arrangements to sell our receivable, we derecognize the receivable only when meeting the  derecognition criteria. The criteria require isolation from the seller, granting the buyer the right to pledge or exchange  the receivables, and legal transfer of control over the receivable. Accounting Policy  Finance receivables consist of receivables in relation to sales-type leases. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of  our customers’ financial condition. We periodically review whether an allowance for credit losses is needed by  considering factors such as historical payment experience, credit quality, the aging of the finance receivables  balances, expected lifetime losses, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. In 2020, 2019 and 2018 we did not record any expected credit losses from finance receivables. As of December 31, 2020,  the finance receivables were neither past due nor impaired. Inventories, net The increase in inventory in 2020 compared to 2019 is driven by the increased demand from customers, higher costs of  our latest technologies and growing install base. The additions for 2020 and 2019 are recorded in Cost of sales, while 2018 is split between Cost of sales of €207.9 million  and Research and Development costs of €10.3 million. The additions for the year mainly relate to inventory items which  became obsolete due to technological developments and design changes. 2021 1,716.1 2022 406.4 2023 2024 — 2025 — Thereafter — Year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2019 2020 Raw materials 2,026.3 2,073.4 Work-in-process 1,505.9 1,805.0 Finished products 771.3 1,164.2 Inventories, gross 4,303.5 5,042.6 Inventory reserves (494.3) (473.2) Inventories, net 3,809.2 4,569.4 Year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2019 2020 Balance at beginning of year (441.3) (494.3) Additions for the year (221.5) (192.4) Effect of changes in exchange rates (0.5) 0.8 Utilization of the reserve 169.0 212.7 Balance at end of year (494.3) (473.2) Finance receivables, gross 2,122.5 Accounting Policy Inventory costs are computed on a first-in, first-out basis. Our inventory values are comprised of purchased  materials, freight expenses, customs duties, production labor and overhead. The valuation of inventory includes  determining which fixed costs should be capitalized into inventory based on the normal capacity of our  manufacturing and assembly facilities. If the usage of our facilities is below the established normal capacity, a  portion of our fixed overhead costs are not capitalized into inventory but instead are expensed in Cost of sales as  incurred. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, based on assumptions about future demand and  market conditions. Valuation of inventory also requires us to establish provisions for inventory that is defective,  obsolete or in excess. We use our demand forecast to develop manufacturing plans and utilize this information to  compare against raw materials, work in progress and finished product levels to determine the amount of defective,  obsolete or excess inventory. Prepaid expenses mainly include prepaid income taxes to intercompany profit on inventory that has not been realized by  the ASML group of €162.9 million (2019: €159.2 million) and the contract balance related to the joint development program  with imec of €53.8 million as of December 31, 2020 (2019: €88.8 million). At the end of 2018 we started the new joint  development program with imec under which we mainly deliver systems and services upfront and receive R&D services  throughout the contract period up until 2024. Equity method investments consists of a 24.9% equity interest acquired on June 29, 2017 in Carl Zeiss SMT Holding  GmbH & Co. KG, a limited partnership that owns Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH, our single supplier of optical columns. We have Other assets For further details on derivative financial instruments see Note 25 Financial risk management. ASML makes non-interest bearing advance payments to support our equity method investment Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH’s  work-in-process. These payments are made to secure optical column deliveries and these advance payments are settled  through future lens or optical column deliveries. The increase in this balance is due to the support provided under the  High-NA agreement.

The difference  between the cost of our investment and our proportionate share of the carrying value of the investee's underlying net  assets as of the acquisition date is the basis difference. The basis difference is allocated to the identifiable assets  and liabilities based on their fair value as of the acquisition date (i.e. the date which we obtain significant influence),  with the excess costs of the investment over our proportional fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities being  equity method goodwill. We amortize the basis difference related to the other intangible assets over the estimated remaining useful lives of  these assets that gave rise to this difference. The remaining weighted-average life of the finite-lived intangible assets  acquired is 16.2 years and is amortized using a straight-line method. In-process R&D is initially capitalized at fair  value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When the R&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an  amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If the project is abandoned,  we will record the full basis difference charge for the value of the related intangible asset in our Consolidated  Statements of Operations in the period of abandonment. Equity method goodwill is not amortized or tested for  impairment; instead the equity method investment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in  circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable. Under the equity method, after initial recognition at cost, our Equity method investments are adjusted for our  proportionate share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the investee, recognized on a one- quarter time lag and presented within Profit from equity method investments. Our proportionate share of the profit or  loss of the investee is adjusted for any differences in accounting principles and policies, basis difference adjustments  and intra-entity profits. Receipt of dividends reduces our Equity method investments, which is presented as an  operating cash flow based on the nature of the distributions. Our maximum exposure related to this agreement is limited to the amount reimbursable from Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH as of  the balance sheet date. R&D and supply chain support costs are capitalized for 24.9% of this funding because it directly benefits us through our  investment in Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co. The amount capitalized is presented within equity method  investments. The remainder of this support relating to supply chain support costs is charged to the cost of sales as  incurred, the part related to R&D costs is charged to Research and development costs as incurred. The support provided related to capital expenditures consists of tooling and facilities, and is determined to be a lease. As  a result, prior to the asset being put into use, it is recorded in Other Assets, then transferred into ROU Assets - Finance  when put into use. determined that Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co. KG is a variable interest entity because the entity was established  without substantive voting rights since there is disparity between our voting rights and our economics, as well as  substantially all of Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co. KG’s activities involve or are conducted on our behalf. However,  we are not the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity because we lack the power, through voting rights or similar  rights, to direct the activities that most significantly impact Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co. KG’s economic  performance. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a profit from equity method investments of €88.6 million (2019:  €18.2 million) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. This profit includes the following components: • Profit of €111.4 million (2019: €82.8 million) related to our share of Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co. KG’s net  income after accounting policy alignment • Cost due to basis difference amortization related to intangible assets of €26.7 million (2019: €26.7 million) • Cost (benefit) due to intercompany profit elimination of €(3.9) million (2019: €13.7 million) • Cost due to dividend forfeiture of €0.0 million (2019: €24.2 million) In 2020 we received a dividend of €128.1 million (2019: €99.9 million) from Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co. Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co. KG is a privately held company; therefore, quoted market prices for its stock are not  available. The following summarizes the total assets and liabilities related to our variable interest in Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH &  Co. KG as reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as our maximum exposure to losses as of December 31,  2020. Our maximum exposure to loss is limited to our equity method investment in Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co.  KG, right-of-use assets and prepayments provided to the equity method investment. EUV and DUV Agreements ASML makes non-interest bearing advance payments to support Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH’s work-in-process. These  payments are made to secure optical column deliveries and these advance payments are settled through future lens or  optical column deliveries. Our maximum exposure related to this agreement is limited to the assets not settled as of the  balance sheet date. High-NA Agreement On November 3, 2016 we agreed with Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH to support their R&D costs, capital expenditures and supply  chain investments, in respect of High-NA, for an amount initially estimated at €760.0 million. The current estimate as of  December 31, 2020 is €1,354.8 million (2019: €1,242.2 million). As of December 31, 2020 our estimated remaining  commitment to Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH is €319.9 million (2019: €524.8 million).

The balance as of December 31, 2020 is €4,629.1 million  (2019: €4,541.1 million). The increase of €87.9 million is the result of the acquisition of Berliner Glas on October 30, 2020.  For details of the Berliner Glas business combination see: Note 2 Business Combinations. We have identified two reporting units: Reporting Unit ASML and Reporting Unit Cymer Light Sources. As of  December 31, 2020 the goodwill allocated to Reporting Unit ASML amounts to €4,166.8 million (2019: €4,078.8 million)  and Reporting Unit Cymer Light Sources amounts to €462.3 million (2019: €462.3 million). Goodwill related to the Berliner  Glas acquisition is allocated to the Reporting Unit ASML. Based on our assessment during the annual goodwill impairment test, we believe it is more likely than not that the fair  values of the reporting units exceed their carrying amounts, and therefore goodwill was not impaired as of December 31,  2020. Goodwill Intangible assets, net Accounting Policy Goodwill represents the excess of the costs of an acquisition over the fair value of the amounts assigned to assets  acquired and liabilities incurred or assumed of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on  acquisition of subsidiaries is allocated to reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is  made to those reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill  arose. Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the  carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. To determine whether it is necessary to perform the  quantitative goodwill impairment test, we perform a step-zero qualitative assessment, annually. If we determine that  it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we do not perform a  quantitative goodwill impairment test. Accounting Policy  Intangible assets include brands, intellectual property, developed technology, customer relationships, and other  intangible assets not yet available for use. These finite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated  amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method based on  the estimated useful lives of the assets. Finite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the balance sheet  carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections for the useful life. During 2020, we recorded amortization charges of €123.5 million (2019: €115.4 million; 2018: €103.7 million) which were  recorded in cost of sales for €101.8 million (2019: €97.4 million; 2018: €97.2 million), in R&D costs for €12.0 million (2019:  €7.5 million and 2018: €1.3 million) and in SG&A costs for €9.7 million (2019: €10.5 million and 2018: €5.2 million). As of December 31, 2020, the intangible assets not yet available for use amount to €24.8 million (2019: €14.9 million) and  are allocated to Reporting Unit ASML. During 2020 we recorded no impairment charges (2019: €0.0 million; 2018: €0.0 million).  As of December 31, 2020, the estimated amortization expenses for intangible assets for the next 5 years and thereafter: Balance at December 31, 2019 38.9 142.4 1,200.1 228.6 110.5 1,720.5 Acquisitions through business combinations — — 30.0 — 2.3 32.3 Additions — 2.5 — — 33.4 35.9 Disposals — — — — (0.2) (0.2) Effect of changes in exchange rates — (0.1) — — (0.1) (0.2) Accumulated amortization Balance at January 1, 2019 7.4 62.8 346.5 70.5 11.6 498.8 Amortization 1.9 7.8 82.0 12.7 11.0 115.4 Disposals — — — — (0.2) (0.2) Effect of changes in exchange rates (0.1) — 0.1 — 2.1 2.1 Amortization 1.9 8.2 82.1 12.7 18.6 123.5 Disposals — — — — (0.2) (0.2) Effect of changes in exchange rates — — — — — — Balance at December 31, 2020 11.1 78.8 510.7 95.9 42.9 739.4 Carrying amount December 31, 2019 29.7 71.8 771.5 145.4 86.0 1,104.4 December 31, 2020 27.8 66.0 719.4 132.7 103.0 1,048.9 €, in millions Brands Intellectual  property Developed  technology Customer  relationships Other Total Cost Balance at January 1, 2019 39.2 68.9 1,199.9 228.6 66.2 1,602.8 Additions — 73.7 — — 42.1 115.8 Disposals — — — — (0.2) (0.2) Effect of changes in exchange rates (0.3) (0.2) 0.2 — 2.4 2.1 2021 129.9 2022 129.4 2023 122.3 2024 113.0 2025 107.8 Thereafter 446.5 Amortization expenses 1,048.9 Balance at December 31, 2020 38.9 144.8 1,230.1 228.6 145.9 1,788.3 Balance at December 31, 2019 9.2 70.6 428.6 83.2 24.5 616.1 Property, plant and equipment, net Accounting Policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment  losses. Costs of assets manufactured by ASML include direct manufacturing costs, production overhead and  interest costs incurred for qualifying assets during the construction period. Property, plant and equipment are  depreciated on a straight-line basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over their estimated useful lives,  except for land which is not depreciated. Evaluation systems leased to our customers under an operating lease are capitalized as Property, plant and  equipment at cost and depreciated over the respective lease term. Leased assets that are returned to ASML upon  expiration of the lease term are either taken back into Property, plant and equipment as they will be used internally  by D&E or transferred back to Inventory to be reworked and sold. The carrying values of prototypes, tooling and equipment that are intended to be sold, but first internally utilized for  more than one year for R&D purposes, are reclassified from Inventories to Property, plant and equipment and  depreciated while being internally used. When no longer required for R&D activities the assets' carrying value is  reclassified back to Inventories and reworked to make them ready for sale to our customers. These transfers are  reported as Net non-cash movements to/from Inventories in our Property, plant and equipment movement schedule. Property, plant and equipment is assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount  may not be recoverable using cash flow projections for the useful life. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying amount includes assets under construction for Land and buildings of €526.3  million (2019: €286.6 million), Machinery and equipment of €113.4 million (2019: €85.4 million), Leasehold improvements  of €32.6 million (2019: €4.5 million) and Furniture, fixtures and other of €4.1 million (2019: €7.8 million). As of December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of land amounts to €102.4 million (2019: €105.7 million). The additions in 2020 in Land and buildings, as well as Furniture, fixtures and other, relates to construction of ASML’s  logistics facility, High-NA factory and office space at our headquarters in Veldhoven, in order to support our continued  growth. The additions in 2020 in Machinery and equipment mainly relate to the upgrade and expansion of production tooling to  support the growth of our business, as well as investments in prototypes of new technologies.

At our other locations, worldwide much of the properties we occupy  are leased and therefore comprise the largest amount of our right-of-use assets. Additionally, we lease warehouse space  at locations world-wide and cars for use by our employees. Right-of-use assets from an operating leases decreased by €25.3 million, mainly due to depreciation over the lease term,  partly offset by new lease contracts. The Right-of-use assets from finance leases mainly consist of facilities and tooling related to our High-NA agreement with  Carl Zeiss SMT, for which the funds are prepaid by ASML. As capital expenditures under this arrangement are placed into  service, we derecognized our prepaid asset and recognized a ROU Asset under a finance lease arrangement. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Lease Liabilities under an operating lease arrangement decreased by €33.1  million, mainly due to scheduled lease payments, partly offset by new lease contracts. The majority of our finance leases do not have an associated lease liability as the lease payments have been prepaid.

Operating leases are included in Right-of-use assets -  Operating, accrued & other current liabilities, and accrued & other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance  sheets. Finance leases are included in Right-of-use assets - Finance, current portion of long-term debt, and Long- term debt in our consolidated balance sheets. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent  our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized  at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As our leases do not  provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement  date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Right-of-use assets include any lease payments made  at or before the commencement date and are reduced by lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to  extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease  payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The lease components are accounted for  separately from non-lease components. The allocation of the consideration between lease and non-lease  components is based on the relative stand-alone prices of lease components included in the lease contracts. For further details on derivative financial instruments see Note 25 Financial risk management. 2. For further details on operating lease liabilities see Note 14 Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Costs to be paid as of December 31, 2020 include accrued costs for unbilled services provided by suppliers including  contracted labor, outsourced services and consultancy. Personnel related items mainly consist of accrued annual short-term incentive bonus plans, accrued vacation days,  accrued pension premiums, accrued wage tax and accrued vacation allowance. The increase in the accrued personnel  related items compared to prior year is mainly due to an increase in the annual short-term incentive bonus plan accrual  based on company performance, as well as the result of the growth of our business, which resulted in an increase in the  number of our employees.

Long-term debt is initially recognized at fair value and subsequently  measured at amortized cost. Debt is qualified as long-term debt as long as the group has an unconditional right to  defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. Interest accruals and payments relating to Long-term debt are accounted for as part of the “Accrued and other  liabilities”. Interest and other costs should be accrued and recorded with the passage of time over the agreed term,  regardless of when the interest receipt or payment has taken place. For the year 2021, the obligations relate to lease payments and Berliner Glas loan repayments. The years thereafter mainly  relate to repayments of principals under our Eurobonds. The fair value of the interest rate swaps excludes accrued interest. We use interest rate swaps to minimize the net interest exposure for the group by aligning the interest terms of the  available cash and the interest bearing debt. The fair value changes of these interest rate swaps are recorded on the  Consolidated Balance Sheets under Other assets and the carrying amount of the Eurobonds is adjusted for these fair  value changes. In February and May of 2020 we issued new Eurobonds with fixed interest coupons. We did not enter into  additional interest rate swaps in connection with these bonds. Source: Bloomberg Finance LP. The fair value of our Eurobonds is estimated based on quoted market prices as of December 31, 2020. The fair value  deviates from the principal amount, due to changes in market interest rates and credit spreads since the issue of our  Eurobonds which carry a fixed coupon interest rate. Lines of credit We maintain an available committed credit facility, with a group of banks, of €700.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and  as of December 31, 2019. No amounts were outstanding under the committed credit facility at the end of 2020 and  2019. This facility of €700.0 million was renegotiated on July 3, 2019, with an original maturity date of July 3, 2024. The  facility includes options for extension by two 1-year extension options. This extends the maturity to potentially 2026, if  agreed by both ASML and the lenders. In June 2020 the first 1-year extension option was exercised extending the  maturity date of the facility from July 2024 to July 2025. Outstanding amounts under this credit facility will bear interest at  EURIBOR plus a margin that depends on our credit rating and ESG score. We have a non-committed guarantee facility of €85.0 million under which guarantees in the ordinary course of business,  such as customs or rental guarantees, can be provided to third parties. As of January 1, 2019, ASML entered into a non- committed credit facility for our Chinese subsidiary of €130.0 million. The non-committed credit facility covers bank  guarantees, standby letters of credit, as well as advances up to €75.0 million. No amounts were outstanding under this  facility. Outstanding amounts under the non-committed facility will bear interest based on market conditions at the  moment of draw down. €, in millions Amount 2021 15.4 2022 512.0 2023 761.1 2024 7.4 2025 2.7 Thereafter 3,265.0 Long-term debt 4,563.6 Less: current portion of long-term debt 15.4 Year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2019 2020 Amortized cost amount 2,983.2 4,474.1 Fair value interest rate swaps 1 114.9 140.4 Carrying amount 3,098.1 4,614.5 Year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2019 2020 Principal amount 3,000.0 4,500.0 Carrying amount 3,098.1 4,614.5 Fair value 1 3,247.7 4,798.8 Non-current portion of long-term debt 4,548.2 Long-term debt obligations mainly relate to principal amounts and interest payments of our Eurobonds.

We have purchase obligations towards suppliers in the ordinary course of business which mainly relates to goods and  services for our operations. The general terms and conditions of the agreements relating to the major part of our purchase  obligations as of December 31, 2020 contain clauses that enable us to delay or cancel delivery of ordered goods and  services up to the dates specified in the purchase agreements, in line with the timing of future sales. The terms and  conditions that we normally agree with our suppliers give us additional flexibility to adapt our purchase obligations to our  requirements in light of the cyclically and technological developments inherent in the industry in which we operate.  Contingencies  ASML is subject to proceedings, litigation and other actual or potential claims. In addition, ASML’s customers may be  subject to claims of infringement from third parties alleging that the ASML equipment used by those customers in the  manufacture of semiconductor products, and / or the methods relating to use of the ASML equipment, infringes one or  more patents issued to those third parties. If these claims were successful, ASML could be required to indemnify such  customers for some or all of the losses incurred or damages assessed against them as a result of that infringement. In connection with any proceedings and claims, our management evaluates, based on the relevant facts and legal  principles, the likelihood of an unfavorable (or favorable) outcome, and whether the amount of the loss (or gain) can be  reasonably estimated. Judgment is required in these evaluations, including judgments regarding the validity of asserted  claims and the likely outcome of legal and administrative proceedings. The outcome of these proceedings, however, is  subject to a number of factors beyond our control, most notably the uncertainty associated with predicting decisions by  courts and administrative agencies. In addition, estimates of the potential costs (or gains) associated with legal and  administrative proceedings frequently cannot be subjected to any sensitivity analysis, as damage estimates or settlement  offers by claimants may bear little or no relation to the eventual outcome. Finally, in any particular proceeding, we may  agree to settle or to terminate a claim or proceeding in which we believe that it would ultimately prevail where we believe  that doing so, when taken together with other relevant commercial considerations, is more effective than engaging in an  expensive and protracted litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. As of December 31, 2020, management has determined that ASML does not have any material contingency which is  considered probable or reasonably probable for each year presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Debt acquired through the Berliner Glas business combination The loans of Berliner Glas are comprised of a mortgage loan of €25.0 million with an annual interest rate of 0.5%  repayable in 2034, revolving credit facilities at various financial institutions of €25.7 million with annual interest rates  varying between 0.8% and 1.2% that are repayable annually through 2024, as well as financial lease liabilities totaling €4.8  million. Interest and other, net  Interest and other, net consist mainly of interest income and interest expenses. In 2020, the interest expense component is  €43.3 million (2019: €36.6 million and 2018: €41.8 million). The expenses mainly relate to interest expense on our  Eurobonds, interest rate swaps and hedges, and amortized financing costs. Commitments and contingencies Commitments We have various contractual obligations, some of which are required to be recorded as liabilities in our Consolidated  Balance Sheets, including long- and short-term debt and lease commitments. Other contractual obligations, namely  purchase obligations, are generally not required to be recognized as liabilities but are required to be disclosed.

As a result of the acquisition of Berliner Glas, around 1,600 employees joined ASML as of October 30,  2020. None of these employees work in the Netherlands. The personnel expenses in 2020 do not include any expenses of  Berliner Glas, since ASML consolidates Berliner Glas using a one-quarter lag. Bonus plans  We have annual performance related short-term incentive (STI) bonus plans for our employees. Under these plans, the  payout depends on company and / or individual performance. This STI bonus (excluding the Board of Management) can  range between 0% and 117.0% of the employees' annual base salary, depending on their job grade and the type of STI  plan. The STI for 2020 is accrued for as part of Accrued and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will  be paid in the first quarter of 2021.

Our  net periodic pension cost for this multi-employer union plan for any period is the amount of the required employer  contribution for that period. This multi-employer union plan is managed by PME and covers approximately 1,400 companies and  approximately 168,000 contributing members. Every company participating in the PME contributes a premium that is  based on the same contribution rate. This contribution rate can fluctuate yearly based on the coverage ratio of the multi- employer union plan. For 2020, the contribution percentage was 22.7% (2019: 22.7%). For 2020, our contribution to this  multi-employer union plan (including the premiums paid by employees), was 14.0% (2019: 11.7%) of the total contribution  to the plan. For 2021, we expect to contribute around €190.0 million to this multi-employer union plan (including the  premiums paid by employees). The pension rights of each employee are based upon the employee’s average salary  during employment. The PME multi-employer union plan monitors its risks on a global basis and is subject to regulation by Dutch  governmental authorities. By Dutch law (the Dutch Pension Act), a multi-employer union plan must be monitored against  specific criteria, including the coverage ratio of the plan’s assets to its obligations. The coverage percentage is calculated  by dividing the funds capital by the total sum of pension liabilities and is based on actual market interest rates. The  coverage ratio as per December 31, 2020 is 97.2% (December 31, 2019: 98.7%) and is below the legally required  minimum coverage ratio of 104.0%. While the current coverage ratio is below the legally required minimum, PME has  made use of a temporary ministerial exemption regulation in 2020 due to the current economic environment, which  exempts PME from the requirement to reduce the pension payouts in 2021. Additionally, PME has initiated a recovery plan to increase the coverage ratio to its legally required minimum level. Based  on this plan it is estimated that the coverage ratio will increase to the legally required minimum coverage ratio as of 2028,  which is within the legally required maximum recovery period of ten years. ASML has no obligation to pay off any deficits  the pension fund may incur, nor do we have any claim to any potential surpluses. We also participate in several other defined contribution pension plans (outside the Netherlands), with our expenses for  these plans equaling the employer contributions made in the relevant period. As part of the acquisition of Berliner Glas, we assumed a pension plan in Switzerland that is classified as a defined benefit  pension plan as a result of a requirement to provide additional funding in case of a shortfall, while surpluses can only  become due to beneficiaries. The plan is funded in line with the statutory requirements. The current level of funding is  sufficient with a coverage ratio of 106. Furthermore, the pension fund is allowed to take measures to limited the deficit  before additional funding is required by the participating companies. As of December 31, 2020, the plan assets are  estimated at €74.7 million and the pension obligation at €89.5 million, resulting in a net pension liability  of €14.8 million recorded under non-current Accrued and other liabilities. Pension and retirement expenses 122.0 152.5 182.6 Year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2018 2019 2020 Pension plan based on multi-employer union plan 74.0 96.6 126.8 Pension plans based on defined contribution 48.0 55.9 55.8 Accounting policy   Contributions to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognized as an expense when employees have  rendered service entitling them to the contributions. Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes  are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where our obligations under the plans are equivalent to  those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan. We maintain one multi-employer union defined benefit pension plan and various other defined contribution pension  plans covering a substantial part of our employees. ASML accounts for its multi-employer defined benefit plan as if it  were a defined contribution plan for the following reasons: • ASML is affiliated to an industry-wide pension fund and uses the pension scheme in common with other  participating companies.  • Under the regulations of the pension plan, the only obligation these participating companies have towards the  pension fund is to pay the annual premium liability. Participating companies are under no obligation whatsoever to  pay off any deficits the pension plan may incur. Nor have they any claim to any potential surpluses. Long-term incentive plans The table below shows the performance criteria and the corresponding weight for the 2020 LTI performance plans. Deferred compensation plans  We have a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for our US employees that allows a select group of management or  highly compensated employees to defer a portion of their salary, bonus, and commissions. The plan allows us to credit  additional amounts to the participants’ account balances. The participants divide their funds among the investments  available in the plan. Participants elect to receive their funds in future periods after the earlier of their employment  termination or their withdrawal election, at least 3 years after deferral. Expenses were close to nil relating to this plan in  2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, our liability under deferred compensation plans was €68.3 million (2019:  €56.6 million).The related compensation plan assets are €67.0 million (2019: €55.1 million). Share-based compensation ASML provides compensation to its employees through different type of share plans. These plans can be categorized as  follows: The fair value of the market based element is measured at the grant date incorporating the expected vesting and  expected value at vesting, using a tailored Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the service plans and the non- market based elements of the performance plans is the share price at grant date less the present value of expected  dividends during the vesting period, as participants are not entitled to dividends payable and voting rights during the  vesting period. The likelihood of the conditions being met for service and non-market performance plans is assessed as  part of the company’s best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Participants are entitled to a conditional grant of company shares upon awarding. Performance plans are subject to cliff  vesting and are accounted for on a straight line basis. Service only plans are subject to graded vesting. Each installment of  the plan is therefore accounted as a separate grant with a separate fair value. This means that each installment will be  separately measured and attributed to expense over the related vesting period. Expenses for the market based element  are recognized during vesting at a fixed vesting level (as the vesting expectation is incorporated in the fair value) provided  that all other performance conditions are met. Expenses for the non-market based elements and service plans are  recognized during vesting at expected vesting levels, which are updated during vesting period as necessary, with a final  update/adjustment at vesting date. All share based remuneration expenses are recognized as personnel expense, with a  corresponding entry in equity, during the vesting period of the award. Share based remuneration expenses are included in  the same income statement line or lines in the functional grouped consolidated statement of operations as the  compensation paid to the employees receiving the stock-based awards. The General Meeting approved the adoption of the most recent remuneration policy for the Board of Management and the  number of shares to be issued. The most recent remuneration policy includes the target and maximum levels of the LTI  plans, the performance measures and pay-out zone percentages. The General Meeting also approved the restrictions and  limits to the Board of Management for issuance/granting of ordinary shares, limits for restricting or excluding the  preemption rights accruing to shareholder and the restrictions and limits to the Board of Management for repurchasing  ordinary shares on behalf of the company. Accounting Policy  As part of our long-term incentive (LTI) bonus, employees can be granted either a service or performance share  based-payment plan including services. For service plans shares are granted at grant date and after having been in  service for a set period (typically 3 years), the participant is awarded these shares at the vesting date. For  performance plans, the shares are conditionally granted and awarded based on the company specific performance  criteria, which can be split between market and non-market based elements. These shares vest after completion of  the service period and the performance reached at vesting date. Employee Umbrella Share Plan  The Employee Umbrella Share Plan, effective as of January 1, 2014 covers all employees. The main purpose of the grants  of Equity Incentives under the Employee Umbrella Share Plan is to continue to attract, reward and retain qualified and  experienced industry professionals in an international labor market. All grants under the Employee Umbrella Share Plan  typically have a 3-year vesting period and are subject to the above mentioned performance or service criteria. Employee purchase plan Every quarter, we offer our worldwide payroll employees the opportunity to buy our shares against fair value using their net  salary. The Board of Management is excluded from participation in this plan. The fair value for shares is based on the  closing price of our shares listed at Euronext Amsterdam on grant date. The maximum net amount for which employees  can participate in the plan amounts to 10.0% of their annual gross base salary. When employees retain the shares for a  minimum of 12 months, we will pay out a 20.0% cash bonus on the initial participation amount. Option plans  The grant-date fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This Black-Scholes  model requires the use of assumptions, including expected share price volatility, the estimated life of each award and the  estimated dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate used in the model is determined, based on an index populated with  euro denominated European government agency bond with high credit ratings and with a life equal to the expected life of Conditional shares outstanding at January 1, 2020 682,029 157.48 578,499 179.22 Granted 210,029 297.05 181,221 302.75 Vested (314,221) 173.80 (274,637) 186.08 Forfeited (22,743) 147.94 (40,329) 179.82 Conditional shares outstanding at December 31, 2020 555,094 201.44 444,754 225.26 Year ended December 31 2018 2019 2020 Share price in € at grant date 166.9 199.5 270.7 Expected volatility ASML 26.1% 29.8% 28.9 % Expected volatility PHLX index 21.3% 24.8% 24.7 % Vesting period 2.9 years 2.5 years 2.9 years Dividend yield 0.8% 1.1% 0.9 % Risk free interest rate (Eurozone) (0.4)% (0.8)% (0.6)% Risk free interest rate (US) 2.2% 1.8% 1.5 % Year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2018 2019 2020 Total compensation expenses incurred for share based remuneration (including  share-based compensation to the BoM) 46.3 74.6 53.9 The income tax benefit (excluding excess income tax benefits) recognized  related to the recognized share-based compensation costs in the US 5.6 5.9 6.6 Total compensation expenses to be incurred for share based remuneration  (including share-based compensation to the BoM) in future periods  94.2 95.8 85.9 Weighted average period in which compensation expenses (including share- based compensation to the BoM) are expected to be recognized 1.7 years 1.6 years 1.6 years Total fair value at vesting date of shares vested during the year (in millions) 46.4 58.7 124.9 61.6 54.9 133.9 Weighted average fair value of shares granted 161.63 190.33 297.05 187.98 206.90 302.75 the equity settled share-based payments.

As of 2017 we no longer grant options to our  employees and all options issued are vested. Issuance of shares upon exercising the stock options are deducted from the  treasury shares.

The disclosure of the Income taxes is therefore split into: Income taxes The Dutch statutory tax rate was 25.0% in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Tax amounts in other jurisdictions are calculated at the  rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.

Under this method, deferred tax assets and  liabilities are recognized for the tax effect of operating losses and tax credit carry forward as well as for tax  consequences attributable to differences between the balance sheets carrying amounts of existing assets and  liabilities and their respective tax bases. If it is more likely than not that the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets  will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded for the differences. Income tax expense includes current and  deferred taxes on profit, including related interest and penalties, as well as actual or potential withholding taxes on  current and expected dividend income from group companies. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the  years in which temporary differences and net operating losses are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on  deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of  Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred income taxes including stranded effects  originally recognized through OCI are recycled through earnings in future periods upon release of the connected item  from OCI to the statement of income. We assess unrecognized tax benefits based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for  recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position  will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to  measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While  we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential  outcomes of examinations by tax authorities in determining the adequacy of our income tax expense, and adjust the  income tax expense, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a  revision become known. As a percentage of income before income taxes. The effective tax rate increased to 13.7% of income before income taxes in 2020, compared to 6.8% in 2019. The lower  rate for 2019 was a result of discrete tax benefits relating to restructuring of our HMI group companies and US Tax Reform  regulations. Income tax expense based on ASML’s domestic rate  The income tax expense based on ASML’s domestic rate is based on the Dutch statutory income tax rate. It reflects  the income tax expense that would have been applicable assuming that all of our income is taxable against the Dutch  statutory tax rate and there are no permanent differences between taxable base and financial results and no Dutch tax  incentives are applied. Effects of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions  A portion of our results is realized in countries other than the Netherlands where different tax rates are applicable. The  effect can differ from year to year depending on the profit before tax in foreign jurisdictions. Adjustments in respect of tax exempt income In past years in certain jurisdictions part of the income generated was tax exempted. In conjunction with changed facts  and circumstances this effect is reduced as of 2020. With regard to previous years the higher effect in 2019 compared to  2018 was caused by a small increasing level of income reported at the level of ASML Hong Kong. Adjustments in respect of tax incentives Adjustments in respect of tax incentives mainly relates to a reduced tax rate as a result of application of the Dutch  Innovation Box. The Innovation box is a facility under Dutch corporate tax law pursuant to which qualified income  associated with R&D is subject to an effective tax rate of 7.0% (rate for 2020; in 2021 effective innovation box tax rate will  increase to 9%). The innovation box benefit is determined according to Dutch laws and published tax policy, the  application of which has been confirmed in an agreement among ASML and the Dutch tax authorities, which agreement  applies for the years 2017 through 2023 assuming facts and circumstances do not change. Furthermore this category includes the benefit of US Tax Reform through the Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII)  deduction at the level of our US group companies. The FDII deduction is a facility under US corporate tax law which  reduces the effective tax rate on qualifying income. The higher effect in 2020 compared to 2019 is mainly caused by an increase in innovation box benefit resulting from an  increased level in income before tax. Adjustments in respect of prior years’ current taxes  The movements in the adjustments in respect of prior years’ current taxes relate to differences between the initially  estimated income taxes and final corporate income tax returns filed, which to a certain extent are offset with  corresponding adjustments in prior years' deferred taxes (movement in temporary differences). The impact in 2019 is mainly due to an increase in the FDII deduction as taken into account in our 2018 tax filing in the  US.

For 2019 the movement was  mainly driven by the capitalization of R&D expenses for tax purposes in the US, which was mirrored by an adjustment in  prior years' current taxes. Movements in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  In 2020, similar to prior years 2019 and 2018, the effective tax rate was impacted by movements in the liability for  unrecognized tax benefits. The movement for 2020 is mainly driven by the finalization of a tax audit at the level of our  South Korean group companies - reference is made to the 'liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits' paragraph below. Tax effects in respect to HMI restructuring  The 2019 and 2018 tax effects are driven by an internal restructuring of our HMI group companies. As a result of this  internal restructuring the deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets that were initially included in the business combination  accounting for HMI have been released during 2018. Furthermore a deferred tax asset has been recognized in 2019 for  book to tax differences on intangible fixed assets transferred as part of the internal restructuring. For 2020 this  restructuring has no additional impact on the effective tax rate. Liability for unrecognized tax benefits We have operations in multiple jurisdictions, where we are subject to the application of complex tax laws. Application of  these complex tax laws may lead to uncertainties on tax positions. We aim to resolve these uncertainties in discussions  with the tax authorities. We record unrecognized tax benefits in line with the requirements of ASC 740, which requires us  to estimate the potential outcome of any tax position. Our estimate for the potential outcome of any uncertain tax position  is highly judgmental. We believe that we have adequately provided for uncertain tax positions. However, settlement of  these uncertain tax positions in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our  Consolidated Financial Statements. Change in valuation allowance   The higher effect in 2020 as compared to prior years is to the main extent caused by the recognition of R&D and  withholding tax credits at the level of our group companies in the Netherlands and the US as of which it is considered not  more likely than not that these can be realized in future years. Equity method investments This line includes the income tax expense relating to our investment in Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co. KG The  higher effect in 2020 compared to 2019 is mainly caused by an increase of the profit before tax of the equity investment. Effect of change in tax rates The impact on the effective tax rate in 2020 is in essence driven by the enacted increase of the Dutch innovation box rate  to 9% as of 2021 as well as reversal of the initial enacted reduction of the general Dutch corporate income tax rate (from  21.7% back to 25%), which rate changes both have impact on the valuation of deferred taxes at the level of the Dutch  group companies. Additionally it includes a small impact of a change in blended tax rate of one or our HMI group companies in the US. Other credits and non-tax deductible items Other credits and non-tax deductible items reflect the impact on our statutory rates of permanent non-tax deductible  items such as non-deductible interest expense and non-deductible meals and entertainment expenses, as well as the  impact of various tax credits on our income tax expense. US Tax Reform  The 2018, 2019 and 2020 year-end tax positions calculated also reflect the regulations of US Tax Reform, thereby taking  into account the guidance issued by the US government. Hereby the position has been taken not to apply the most recent  guidance relating to the final FDII regulations issued in 2020 retrospectively, but only as of 2021 onwards, which is  permitted under the aforementioned regulations. In regard to GILTI and BEAT, the decision has been taken to treat this as  a period permanent item. Year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2019 2020 Liability for unrecognized tax benefits (227.1) (200.4) Deferred tax assets 445.3 671.5 Deferred tax liabilities (7.3) (37.9) Deferred and other tax assets (liabilities) 210.9 433.2 Consistent with the requirements of ASC 740, as of December 31, 2020, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties amounts to €200.4 million (2019: €227.1 million) which is classified as Deferred and other  tax liabilities. If recognized, these unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate for approximately equal  amounts. Expected interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities have been accrued for and are included in the liability  for unrecognized tax benefits and in the income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties in 2020 amount to a benefit  of €(14.2) million (2019: €9.0 million expense; 2018: €32.6 million expense). We conclude our allowances for tax contingencies to be appropriate. Based on the information currently available, we  estimate that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by €33.1 million (excluding interest and penalties)  within the next 12 months, mainly as a result of expiration of statute of limitations. Gross increases of tax positions in prior period and Settlements are in essence mainly relating to finalization of a tax audit  at the level of our South Korean group companies. We file income tax returns in all countries where we operate, with the Netherlands, US, Taiwan, South Korea and China  being the major jurisdictions. The years for which tax returns are still open for examination for respective jurisdictions are  as follows: We are routinely subject to examinations and audits from tax and other authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we  operate. We believe that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been provided for, and any  adjustments as a result of examinations are not expected to have a material adverse effect.

Tax effect carry-forward losses and Tax credits  The deferred tax assets from carry-forward losses and R&D & other credits recognized as per December 31, 2020 are  almost fully reserved. R&D & other credits for the amount of €92.9 million have no expiration date. The remaining R&D &  other credits of €24.3 million have an expiration date between 2021 and 2035. The carry-forward losses of €133.9 million  have an expiration date between 2021 and 2030. Unrecognized Deferred Tax Liability Related to Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries  In general, it is our practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of our non-Dutch subsidiaries in those operations and  distribute only when necessary or opportune by law. The tax implications of distributions by such non-Dutch subsidiaries  are dependent on local tax and accounting regulations applying at the moment of actual distribution. As these cannot  practicably be determined no deferred tax liability has been recognized in respect of undistributed profit reserves of the  foreign subsidiaries. As per December 31, 2020 the aggregate amount of unrecognized temporary differences  approximately amounts to €240.0 million.

Since certain of our  ordinary shares were held by brokers and nominees, the number of record holders in the US may not be representative of  the number of beneficial holders, or of where the beneficial holders are resident. A total of 96,566,077 depository receipts for ordinary shares were issued at the launch of the CCIP. This number has since  decreased with the sell-down by the relevant customers following expiry of the lock-up. Each ordinary share consists of 900 fractional shares. Fractional shares entitle the holder thereof to a fractional dividend,  but do not give entitlement to voting rights. Only those persons who hold shares directly in the share register in the  Netherlands, held by us at our address at 5504 DR Veldhoven, de Run 6501, the Netherlands, or in the New York share  register, held by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., P.O. Box 64506, St. Paul, MN 55164-0506, United States, can hold  fractional shares. Shareholders who hold ordinary shares through the deposit system under the Dutch Securities Bank  Giro Transactions Act maintained by the Dutch central securities depository Euroclear Nederland or through the  Depository Trust Company cannot hold fractional shares. No ordinary shares B and no cumulative preference shares have been issued.  There are no special voting rights on the issued shares in our share capital. Certain voting restrictions apply in respect of ordinary shares issued in connection with the customer co-investment  program, which ASML entered into in 2012 with three key customers – Intel, TSMC and Samsung – to accelerate ASML’s  development of EUV. Under this program, the participating customers funded certain development programs and invested  in ASML’s ordinary shares. Currently, only one participating customer still holds (directly or indirectly) ordinary shares. The  voting restrictions in respect of these ordinary shares are set out in the underlying agreement between ASML and the  relevant customer. There are currently no limitations, either under Dutch law or in ASML’s Articles of Association, on the transfer of ordinary  shares in the share capital of ASML. Pursuant to ASML’s Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board’s approval shall be  required for every transfer of cumulative preference shares. Issue and repurchase of (rights to) shares Our Board of Management has the power to issue ordinary shares and cumulative preference shares insofar as it has  been authorized to do so by the General Meeting. The Board of Management requires approval of the Supervisory Board  for such an issue. The authorization by the General Meeting can only be granted for a certain period not exceeding five  years and may be extended for no longer than five years on each occasion. If the General Meeting has not authorized the  Board of Management to issue shares, the General Meeting will be authorized to issue shares on the Board of  Management’s proposal, provided that the Supervisory Board has approved such proposal. Holders of ASML’s ordinary shares have a preemptive right, in proportion to the aggregate nominal amount of the ordinary  shares held by them. This preemptive right may be restricted or excluded. Holders of ordinary shares do not have  preemptive right with respect to any ordinary shares issued for consideration other than cash or ordinary shares issued to  employees. If authorized for this purpose by the General Meeting, the Board of Management has the power, subject to  approval of the Supervisory Board, to restrict or exclude the preemptive rights of holders of ordinary shares. At our 2020 AGM, the Board of Management was authorized from April 22, 2020 through October 22, 2021, subject to the  approval of the Supervisory Board, to issue shares and / or rights thereto representing up to a maximum of 5% of our  issued share capital at April 22, 2020, plus an additional 5% of our issued share capital at April 22, 2020 that may be  issued in connection with mergers, acquisitions and / or (strategic) alliances.

We may repurchase our issued ordinary shares at any time, subject to compliance with the requirements of Dutch law and  our Articles of Association. Any such repurchases are subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and the  authorization by the General Meeting, which authorization may not be for more than 18 months. At the 2020 AGM, the Board of Management was authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to repurchase  through October 22, 2021, up to a maximum of two times 10% of our issued share capital at April 22, 2020, at a price  between the nominal value of the ordinary shares purchased and 110% of the market price of these securities on Euronext  Amsterdam or NASDAQ. ASML Preference Shares Foundation  The ASML Preference Shares Foundation (Stichting Preferente Aandelen ASML), a foundation organized under Dutch law,  has been granted an option right to acquire preference shares in the share capital of ASML. The Foundation may exercise  the Preference Share Option in situations where, in the opinion of the Foundation’s Board of Directors, ASML’s interests,  ASML’s business or the interests of ASML’s stakeholders are at stake. This may be the case if: • a public bid for ASML’s shares is announced or made, or there is a justified expectation that such a bid will be made  without any agreement having been reached with ASML in relation to such a bid; or  • in the opinion of the Foundation’s Board of Directors, the (attempted) exercise of the voting rights by one shareholder  or more shareholders, acting in concert, is materially in conflict with ASML’s interests, ASML’s business or ASML’s  stakeholders. The Foundation’s objectives are to look after the interests of ASML and the enterprises maintained by and/or affiliated in a  group with ASML, in such a way that the interests of ASML, of those enterprises and of all parties concerned are  safeguarded in the best possible way, and that influences in conflict with these interests, which might affect the  independence or the identity of ASML and those companies, are deterred to the best of the Foundation’s ability, and  everything related to the above or possibly conducive thereto. The Foundation aims to realize its objects by acquiring and  holding cumulative preference shares in the capital of ASML and by exercising the rights attached to these shares,  particularly the voting rights. The Preference Share Option gives the Foundation the right to acquire such number of cumulative preference shares as  the Foundation will require, provided that the aggregate nominal value of such number of cumulative preference shares  shall not exceed the aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares issued at the time of exercise of the Preference Share  Option. The subscription price will be equal to their nominal value. Only one-fourth of the subscription price would be  payable at the time of initial issuance of the cumulative preference shares, with the other three-fourths of the nominal value  only being payable when ASML calls up this amount. Exercise of the preference share option could effectively dilute the  voting power of the outstanding ordinary shares by one-half.  Cancellation and repayment of the issued cumulative preference shares by ASML requires authorization by the General  Meeting, on a proposal to this effect made by the Board of Management and approved by the Supervisory Board. If the  Preference Share Option is exercised and as a result cumulative preference shares are issued, ASML will initiate the  repurchase or cancellation of all cumulative preference shares held by the Foundation on the Foundation’s request. In that  case, ASML is obliged to effect the repurchase and respective cancellation as soon as possible. A cancellation will result  in a repayment of the amount paid and exemption from the obligation to pay up on the cumulative preference shares. A  repurchase of the cumulative preference shares can only take place when such shares are fully paid up. If the Foundation does not request ASML to repurchase or cancel all cumulative preference shares held by the Foundation  within 20 months of issuance of these shares, we will be required to convene a General Meeting for the purpose of  deciding on a repurchase or cancellation of these shares.  The Foundation is independent of ASML. The Board of Directors of the Foundation is composed of four independent  members from the Netherlands’ business and academic communities. The Foundation’s Board of Directors is composed  of the following members: Mr A.P.M. van der Poel, Mr S. Perrick, Mr A.H. Lundqvist and Mr. Streppel. Other than the arrangements made with the Foundation as described above, ASML has not established any other anti- takeover devices. Dividend policy ASML aims to distribute a dividend that will be growing over time, paid semi-annually. On an annual basis, the Board of  Management, upon prior approval from the Supervisory Board, submits a proposal to the AGM with respect to the amount  of dividend to be declared with respect to the prior year, taking into account any interim dividend distributions. The  dividend proposal in any given year will be subject to availability of distributable profits, retained earnings and cash, and  may be affected by, among other things, our view of potential future liquidity requirements including for investments in  production capacity, working capital requirements, the funding of our R&D programs and acquisition opportunities that  may arise from time to time. ASML intends to declare a total dividend in respect of 2020 of €2.75 per ordinary share. Recognizing the interim dividend  of €1.20 per ordinary share paid in November 2020, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the General Meeting  of €1.55 per ordinary share. This is a 15% increase compared to the 2019 total dividend of €2.40 per ordinary share. Dividends on ordinary shares are payable out of net income or retained earnings as shown in our Financial Statements as  adopted by our AGM, after payment first of (accumulated) dividends out of net income on any issued cumulative  preference shares. Purchase of equity securities  In addition to dividend payments, we intend to return cash to our shareholders on a regular basis through share buybacks  or capital repayment, subject to our actual and anticipated level of liquidity requirements and other relevant factors.  On January 22, 2020 we announced a new three year share buyback program, to be executed within the 2020-2022 time  frame pursuant to which ASML expects to purchase shares up to €6 billion, which includes a total of up to 0.4 million  shares to cover employee share plans. ASML intends to cancel the remainder of the shares repurchased. This program was temporarily paused in the first quarter of 2020 in order to address the uncertainty related to COVID-19,  and subsequently resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020. In 2020 we repurchased 3,908,429 shares (2019:  1,948,808 shares) for a total consideration of €1,207.5 million (2019: €410 million) and cancelled 6,162,395 shares, of  which 4,255,817 shares were repurchased under the 2018-2019 program (2019: 5,806,366 shares canceled). The remainder of the shares bought back under the 2020-2022 program is intended to be canceled, with the exception of  up to 0.4 million shares, which will be used to cover employee share plans. The share buyback program may be  suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. Net income per ordinary share Basic net income per ordinary share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary  shares outstanding for that period. The dilutive effect is calculated using the treasury stock method by dividing net income by the weighted average number  of ordinary shares outstanding for that period plus shares applicable to options and conditional shares (Dilutive potential  ordinary shares). The calculation of diluted net income per ordinary share does not assume exercise of options when  exercise would be anti-dilutive. Excluded from the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding calculation are  cumulative preference shares contingently issuable to the preference share foundation, since they represent a different  class of stock than the ordinary shares.

Our reliance on a limited group of suppliers  involves several risks, including a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of required components, reduced control  over pricing and the risk of untimely delivery of these components and subassemblies.  Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH, in which ASML owns an indirect interest of 24.9%, is our single supplier, and we are their single  customer, of Optical Columns for lithography systems. Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH is capable of developing and producing  these items only in limited numbers and only through the use of manufacturing and testing facilities in Oberkochen and  Wetzlar, Germany. In 2020, 28.2% of our cost of system sales was purchased from Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH (2019: 28.3%; 2018: 28.3%). Our relationship with Carl Zeiss AG is structured as a strategic alliance pursuant to several agreements executed in 1997  and subsequent years. These agreements define a framework in all areas of our business relationship. The partnership  between ASML and Carl Zeiss AG is run under the principle of ‘two companies, one business’ and is focused on  continuous improvement of operational excellence. Pursuant to these agreements, ASML and Carl Zeiss AG have agreed  to continue their strategic alliance until either party provides at least three years notice of its intent to terminate. A constraint in the production could result in limited availability of Optical Columns. During 2020, our production was not  limited by the deliveries from Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH.  For further information on the relationship between ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH, see Note 10 Equity method  investments and Note 26 Related party transactions. Financial risk management We are exposed to certain financial risks such as foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital  risk. Our overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimize  potentially adverse effects on our financial performance. Our risk management program focuses appropriately on the  current environment of uncertainty in the financial markets. • Liquidity: Maintain financial stability with a target to keep our Cash & cash equivalents, together with Short-term  investments, above a minimum range of €2.0 to €2.5 billion  • Capital structure: Maintain a capital structure that targets a solid investment grade credit rating  • Cash return: Provide a sustainable dividend per share that will grow over time, paid semi-annually, while returning  excess cash to shareholders through share buybacks or capital repayment We use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. None of these transactions are entered into for  trading or speculative purposes. We use market information to determine the fair value of our derivative financial  instruments. Foreign currency risk management  We are exposed to currency risks. Our Financial Statements are expressed in euros. Accordingly, our results of operations  are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates between the euro and other currencies. Changes in currency exchange  rates can result in losses in our Financial Statements. We are particularly exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates  between the US dollar and the euro, and to a lesser extent to the Japanese yen, the South Korean won, the Taiwanese Year ended December 31 (€, in millions, except per share data) 2018 2019 2020 Net income 2,591.6 2,592.3 3,553.7 Weighted average number of shares outstanding 424.9 420.8 418.3 Basic net income per ordinary share 6.10 6.16 8.49 Weighted average number of shares outstanding 424.9 420.8 418.3 Plus shares applicable to options and conditional shares 1.5 0.9 0.8 Diluted weighted average number of shares 426.4 421.6 419.1 Diluted net income per ordinary share 6.08 6.15 8.48 dollar and Chinese yuan, in relation to the euro. We incur costs of sales predominantly in euros with portions also  denominated in US and Taiwanese dollars. A small portion of our operating results are driven by movements in currencies  other than the euro, US dollar, Japanese yen, South Korean won, Taiwanese dollar or Chinese yuan. In general, our  customers run their businesses in US dollars and therefore a weakening of the US dollar against the euro might impact the  ability or desire of our customers to purchase our products at quoted prices. Foreign currency sensitivity   The following table details our sensitivity to a 10.0% strengthening of foreign currencies against the euro. The sensitivity  analysis includes foreign currency denominated monetary items outstanding and adjusts their translation at the period end  for a 10.0% strengthening in foreign currency rates. A positive amount indicates an increase in net income or equity. It is our policy to limit the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  The impact on net income reflects our net exposure to currencies other than the euro at year-end 2020. The negative  effect on net income as presented in the table above for 2020 is mainly attributable to timing differences between the  arising and hedging of exposures. The effects of the fair value movements of cash flow hedges, entered into for US dollar transactions are recognized in  equity. The US dollar effect on equity in 2020 compared with 2019 is the result of an increase in outstanding purchase  hedges and increase in outstanding sales hedges. For a 10.0% weakening of the foreign currencies against the euro, there would be approximately an equal but opposite  effect on net income and equity. Foreign currency risk policy  It is our policy to hedge material transaction exposures, such as forecasted sales and purchase transactions. We hedge  these exposures through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. Foreign exchange contracts  The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts in the main currencies US dollar,  Japanese yen and Taiwanese dollar at December 31, 2020 are USD 0.4 billion, JPY 15.5 billion and TWD 0.5 billion (2019:  USD 0.2 billion, JPY 8.6 billion and TWD 3.8 billion). The hedged highly probable forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currency are expected to occur at various  dates during the coming 12 months. Gains and losses recognized in OCI on forward foreign exchange contracts included  in a hedge relationship will be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period during which the  hedged forecasted transactions affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In 2020, we recognized a net amount of €2.3 million gain (2019: €10.7 million gain; 2018: €11.8 million loss) in the  Consolidated Statements of Operations resulting from effective cash flow hedges for forecasted sales and purchase  transactions that occurred in the year. Furthermore, we recognized a net amount of €28.2 million gain in the Consolidated  Statements of Operations resulting from derivative financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss (2019:  €12.0 million loss; 2018: €24.2 million gain), which is almost fully offset by the revaluation of the hedged monetary items. As of December 31, 2020, accumulated OCI includes €26.1 million representing the total anticipated loss to be charged to  cost of sales (2019: gain €2.1 million and 2018: gain €10.9 million) (net of taxes: 2020: loss €22.7 million; 2019: gain €1.8  million; 2018: gain €9.7 million), which will offset the euro equivalent of foreign currency denominated forecasted purchase  transactions. All amounts are expected to be released over the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2020, accumulated  OCI includes gain €0.4 million (2019: loss €1.2 million; 2018: loss €1.4 million), representing the total anticipated gain to be  released to sales. The effectiveness of all contracts for which we apply hedge accounting is monitored on a quarterly basis  throughout the life of the hedges. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, no ineffective hedge relationships were recognized. Interest rate risk management  We have interest-bearing assets and liabilities that expose us to fluctuations in market interest rates, managed through  interest rate swaps.

The table below shows the effect of a 1.0  percentage point increase in interest rates on our net income and equity. A positive amount indicates an increase in net  income and equity. The positive effect on net income mainly relates to our total amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term  investments being higher than our total floating debt position.  For a  1.0 percentage point decrease in interest rates there would be approximately an equal but opposite effect on net  income and equity. Hedging policy interest rates  We use interest rate swaps to minimize the net interest exposure for the group by aligning the interest terms of the  available cash and the interest bearing debt. There may be residual interest rate risk to the extent the asset and liability  positions do not fully offset. Interest rate swaps  The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts as of December 31, 2020 was €3.0 billion  (2019: €3.0 billion). During 2020, these outstanding hedges were highly effective in hedging the fair value exposure to  interest rate movements. The changes in fair value of the Eurobonds were included in the Consolidated Statements of  Operations in the same period as the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps. In February and May 2020 we  issued new Eurobonds with fixed interest coupons. We did not enter into interest rate swaps in connection with these  bonds. Credit risk management Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentration of credit risk consist principally of Cash and  cash equivalents, Short-term investments, Derivative financial instruments used for hedging activities, Accounts receivable  and Finance receivables and prepayments to suppliers. Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and Derivative financial instruments contain an element of risk of the  counterparties being unable to meet their obligations. Our risk management program focuses appropriately on the current  environment of uncertainty in the financial markets. We invest our Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments  in short-term deposits with financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings and in government and or  government related bodies that have investment grade credit ratings and in money market and other investment funds  that invest in high-rated debt securities. To mitigate the risk that our counterparties in hedging transactions are unable to  meet their obligations, we enter into transactions with a limited number of major financial institutions that have investment  grade credit ratings and closely monitor their creditworthiness. Concentration risk is mitigated by limiting the exposure to  each of the individual counterparties. Our customers consist of integrated circuit manufacturers located throughout the world. We perform ongoing credit  evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. We mitigate credit risk through additional measures, including the use of  down payments, letters of credit, and contractual ownership retention provisions. Retention of ownership enables us to  recover the systems in the event a customer defaults on payment. Liquidity risk management  Our principal sources of liquidity consist of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term investments and available credit  facilities with a target to keep our Cash & cash equivalents, together with Short-term investments, above a minimum range  of €2.0 to €2.5 billion. In addition, we may from time to time raise additional funding in debt and equity markets. We seek  to ensure that our principal sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements at all times.   Our liquidity needs are affected by many factors, some of which are based on the normal on-going operations of the  business, and others that relate to the uncertainties of the global economy and the semiconductor industry. Although our  cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors, we believe that cash generated from  operations, together with our other sources of liquidity are sufficient to satisfy our current requirements, including our  expected capital expenditures and debt servicing. We intend to return cash to our shareholders on a regular basis in the form of dividend payments and, subject to our  actual and anticipated liquidity requirements and other relevant factors, share buybacks or capital repayments. Year ended December 31 (€, in millions) 2019 2020 Impact on net  income  Impact on  equity  Impact on net  income  Impact on  equity  Effect of a 1.0% point increase in interest rates 17.2 — 43.5 — Capital risk management  Our objectives when managing our capital structure are to safeguard our ability to satisfy our capital providers by  maintaining a capital structure that ensures liquidity and supports a solid investment grade credit rating. The capital  structure includes both debt and the components of equity, in accordance with both US GAAP and EU-IFRS. The capital  structure is mainly altered by, among other things, adjusting the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, the amount of  share buybacks or capital repayment, and any changes in the level of debt. Our capital structure is formally reviewed with  the Supervisory Board each year in connection with our updated long term financial plan and relevant scenarios. The  outcome of this year’s review confirmed to maintain our historical financing policy in relation to our capital structure. Our current credit rating from Moody’s is A3 (stable) and from Fitch is A- (stable), which is consistent with the credit ratings  as of December 31, 2019. Accounting Policy - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  We measure all derivative financial instruments based on fair values derived from level 2 input criteria. We adopt  hedge accounting for hedges that are highly effective in offsetting the identified hedged risks taking into account  required effectiveness criteria.   Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently  remeasured. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated  as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. We designate derivatives as one of the  following: • A hedge of an exposure relating to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, that is attributable to  a particular risk (fair value hedge).   • A hedge of an exposure relating to the variability in the cash flows of a recognized asset or liability, or of a  forecasted transaction, that is attributable to a particular risk (cash flow hedge).   • A hedge of the foreign currency exposure relating to a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment  hedge).   We assess at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as  well as our risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. We also assess,  both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are  highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. The cash flows resulting from the  derivative financial instruments are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows according to the nature  of the hedged item. Fair value hedge   Changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument, that is designated and qualified as a fair value hedge,  along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the  Consolidated Statements of Operations.   Hedge accounting is discontinued when we revoke the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is  sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The adjustment to the carrying amount of  the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortized to the Consolidated Statements of Operations from that  date. Interest rate swaps that are being used to hedge the fair value of fixed loan coupons payable are designated as fair  value hedges. The change in fair value is intended to offset the change in the fair value of the underlying fixed loan  coupons, which is recorded accordingly. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps  hedging fixed loan coupons payable is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as interest and  other, net. Cash flow hedge  Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualified as a cash flow hedge are recorded in OCI,  net of taxes, until the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In  the event that the underlying hedge transaction will not occur within the specified time period, the gain or loss on the  related cash flow hedge is released from OCI and included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, unless  extenuating circumstances exist that are related to the nature of the forecasted transaction and are outside our  control or influence and which cause the forecasted transaction to be probable of occurring on a date that is beyond  the specified time period. Foreign currency hedging instruments that are being used to hedge cash flows related to forecasted sales or  purchase transactions in non-functional currencies are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain or loss relating to  the ineffective portion of the foreign currency hedging instruments is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of  Operations in Net sales or Cost of sales. The fair value part of a hedging derivative financial instrument that has a remaining term of 12 months or less after balance  sheet date is classified as current asset or liability. When the fair value part of a hedging derivative has a term of more than  12 months after balance sheet date, it is classified as non-current asset or liability. Derivative financial instruments are  included in Other assets and Accrued and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, split between current and  non-current. Fair value measurements  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation  techniques used to measure fair value as follows: • Level 1: Valuations based on inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the  entity has the ability to access.  • Level 2: Valuations based on inputs other than level 1 inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities,  quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable  data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.   • Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair  value of the assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or  liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). A financial instrument’s fair value classification is  based on the lowest level of any input that is significant in the fair value measurement hierarchy.  Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis  Investments in money market funds (included in our Cash and cash equivalents) have fair value measurements which are  all based on quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities. Our Short-term investments consist of deposits with original maturities to the entity holding the investments longer than 3  months and one year or less at the date of acquisition with financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings.  The fair value of the deposits is determined with reference to quoted market prices in an active market for similar assets or  discounted cash flow analysis.   The principal market in which we execute our derivative contracts is the institutional market in an over-the-counter  environment with a high level of price transparency. The market participants usually are large commercial banks. The  valuation inputs for our derivative contracts are based on quoted prices and quoting pricing intervals from public data  sources; they do not involve management judgment.  The valuation technique used to determine the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts (used for hedging  purposes) approximates the net present value technique which is the estimated amount that a bank would receive or pay  to terminate the forward foreign exchange contracts at the reporting date, taking into account current interest rates and  current exchange rates.

Our Eurobonds serve as hedged items in fair value hedge relationships in which we hedge the variability of changes in the  fair value of our Eurobonds due to changes in market interest rates with interest rate swaps. The fair values of these  interest rate swaps are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under derivative financial instruments (within other  current and non-current assets and other current and non-current liabilities) and the carrying amounts of the Eurobonds  are adjusted for the effective portion of these fair value changes only. For the actual aggregate carrying amount and the  fair value of our Eurobonds, see Note 16 Long-term debt and interest and other costs. Long-term debt relates to Eurobonds. See Note 16 Long-term debt and interest and other costs. Long-term debt relates to Eurobonds. See Note 16 Long-term debt and interest and other costs. There were no transfers between levels during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value  The carrying amount of Cash and cash equivalents, Accounts payable, and other current financial assets and liabilities  approximate their fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Money market and investment funds measurement  The money market and investment funds qualify as available for sale securities. The fair value is close to the carrying value  due to short term nature and since related to investment with investment grade credit ratings. Allowances for credit losses  and total unrealized gains and losses are close to nil. These money market funds can be called on a daily basis.  Investments and redemptions in money market funds are managed on a daily basis based triggered through actual cash  balances. Realized gain and losses on these money market funds are not significant given low interest rates and high  credit ratings. Costs of securities were close to nil. ASML does not have trading securities as of December 31, 2020. Deposits measurement  The deposits as part of the Cash and cash equivalents and Short term investments qualify as securities held to maturity.  The amortized cost value is close to the fair value and carrying value due to short term nature and since related to  investment with investment grade credit ratings. Allowance for credit losses and total unrealized gains and losses are  close to nil. Maturities are shorter than one year. No held to maturity securities were sold before expiration date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis  In 2019 and 2020, we had no significant fair value measurements on a non-recurring basis from regular business activities.  We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets during 2019 and 2020. For fair  value measurements in relation to the acquisition of Berliner Glas, we refer to Note 2 Business Combinations.

KG see Note 10 Equity method  investments. There have been no transactions between ASML or any of its subsidiaries, any other significant shareholder, any director  or officer, or any relative or spouse thereof, other than ordinary course (compensation) arrangements. During our most  recent fiscal year, there has been no, and at present there is no, outstanding indebtedness to ASML owed by or owing to  any director or officer of ASML or any associate thereof, other than the virtual financing arrangement with respect to  shares described under Note 19 Employee benefits. Furthermore, ASML has not granted any personal loans, guarantees,  or the like to members of the Board of Management or Supervisory Board. ASML makes non-interest bearing advance payments to support our equity method investment Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH’s  work-in-process. These payments are made to secure optical column deliveries and these advance payments are settled  through future lens or optical column deliveries. The increase in this balance is due to the support provided under the  High-NA agreement.   In 2018, ASML and Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH entered into an agreement for ASML to support the development and  integration of certain tooling to be used in future production of High-NA optical columns, for which Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH  has agreed to reimburse all costs to ASML. Receivable amounts from Carl Zeiss SMT GmbH are presented within Other  Assets. The total purchases and outstanding balances with Carl Zeiss SMT Holding GmbH & Co.

Dassen Executive Vice President, CFO and member of the Board of Management To the Shareholders and the Supervisory Board of ASML  Holding N.V.: Our conclusion  We have reviewed the non-financial information (hereafter:  the Non-financial Information) of the ‘Annual Report 2020’  of ASML Holding N.V (hereafter: the Company) for the year  ended December 31, 2020 in accordance with U.S.  generally accepted accounting principles (hereafter: the  Annual Report). A review is aimed at obtaining a limited  level of assurance. Based on the procedures performed nothing has come to  our attention that causes us to believe that the non- financial information is not prepared, in all material  respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria as  described in the ‘Applicable criteria’ section of our report. The non-financial information consists of: 2020 at a  glance (pages 4-8), Who we are and what we do (pages  9-25), What we achieved in 2020 (pages 26-72), How we  manage risk (pages 86-88), Responsible business (pages  99-103) and the Non-financial statements (pages 199-224). The non-financial information consists of: 2020 at a  glance (pages 5-9), Who we are and what we do (pages  10-27), What we achieved in 2020 (pages 28-74), How we  manage risk (pages 90-92), Responsible business (pages  104-108) and the Non-financial statements (pages 206- 227). Basis for our conclusion  We performed our review in accordance with Dutch law,  including Dutch Standard 3810N: "Assurance  engagements relating to sustainability reports", which is a  specified Dutch standard that is based on the International  Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000:  "Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of  Historical Financial Information (Attestation engagements)". Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in  the ‘Auditor’s responsibilities’ section of our report. We are independent of ASML Holding N.V. in accordance  with the ‘Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van  accountants bij assurance-opdrachten’ (ViO, Code of  Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with  respect to independence). Furthermore, we have complied  with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels  accountants’ (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics). We believe the assurance evidence we have obtained is  enough and appropriate to provide a basis for our  conclusion. Applicable criteria The non-financial information needs to be read and  understood together with the reporting criteria. The  Company is solely responsible for selecting and applying  these reporting criteria, taking into account applicable law  and regulations related to reporting. Materiality   Based on our professional judgement we determined  materiality levels for each relevant part of the Annual  Report and for the non-financial information as a whole.  When evaluating our materiality levels, we have taken into  account quantitative and qualitative considerations as well  as the relevance of information for both stakeholders and  the Company. We agreed with the Supervisory Board that misstatements  which are identified during the review and which in our  view must be reported on quantitative or qualitative  grounds, would be reported to them. Scope of the group review  ASML Holding N.V. is the parent company of a group of  entities. The non-financial information incorporates the  consolidated information of this group of entities to the  extent as specified in 'About the non-financial information’  of the Annual Report. Our group review procedures consisted of both review  procedures at corporate (consolidated) level and at site  level. Our selection of sites in scope of our review  procedures is primarily based on the site’s individual  contribution to the consolidated information. By performing our review procedures at site level, together  with additional review procedures at corporate level, we  have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate  assurance evidence about the group’s non-financial  information to provide a conclusion about the non-financial  information. Limitations to the scope of our review  The non-financial information includes prospective  information such as ambitions, strategy, plans,  expectations and estimates. Inherently the actual future  results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on  the assumptions and achievability of prospective  information in the non-financial information. References to external sources or websites in the non- financial information are not part of the non-financial  information itself as reviewed by us. Therefore, we do not  provide assurance on this information. Board of Management's responsibilities  The Board of Management of the Company is responsible  for the preparation of the non-financial information in  accordance with the applicable criteria as described in the  ‘Applicable criteria’ section of our report, including the  identification of stakeholders and the definition of material  matters. The choices made by the Board of Management  regarding the scope of the Annual Report and the reporting section ‘About the non-financial information’ of the Annual  Report. policy are summarized in section ‘About the non-financial  information’ of the Annual Report. Furthermore, the Board of Management is responsible for  such internal control as it determines is necessary to  enable the preparation of the non-financial information that  is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or  error. The Board of Management is, amongst other things,  responsible for overseeing the Company’s reporting  process. Auditor’s responsibilities  Our responsibility is to plan and perform our review in a  manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate  assurance evidence for our conclusion. Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of  assurance are aimed to determine the plausibility of  information and vary in nature and timing, and are less in  extent, compared to a reasonable assurance engagement.  The level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance  engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that  would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance  engagement been performed. We apply the ‘Nadere Voorschriften Kwaliteitssystemen’  (NVKS, Regulations for Quality management systems) and  accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality  control including documented policies and procedures  regarding compliance with ethical requirements,  professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory  requirements. We have exercised professional judgment and have  maintained professional skepticism throughout the review,  in accordance with the Dutch Standard 3810N, ethical  requirements and independence requirements. • Performing an analysis of the external environment and  obtaining an understanding of relevant societal themes  and issues, and the characteristics of the Company; • Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting  criteria used, their consistent application and related  disclosures in the Annual Report. This includes the  evaluation of the results of stakeholder dialogue and  the reasonableness of estimates made by the Board of  Management; • Obtaining an understanding of the reporting processes  for the non-financial information, including obtaining a  general understanding of internal control relevant to our  review; • Identifying areas of the non-financial information where  a material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,  are most likely to occur, designing and performing  assurance procedures responsive to these areas, and  obtaining assurance information that is enough and  appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion. These  procedures included, amongst others:  –  Interviewing management and relevant staff  at corporate level responsible for the strategy,  policy and results; –  Interviewing relevant staff responsible for  providing the information for, carrying out internal  control procedures over, and consolidating the  data in the non-financial information; –  Obtaining assurance information that the non- financial information reconciles with underlying  records of the Company; –  Reviewing, on a limited test basis, relevant  internal and external documentation; –  Performing analytical reviews of the data and  trends. • Evaluating the consistency of the non-financial  information with the information in the report which is  not included in the scope of our review; • Evaluating the presentation, structure and content of the  non-financial information; • Considering whether the non-financial information as a  whole, including the disclosures, reflects the purpose of  the reporting criteria used. We have communicated with the Supervisory Board  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the review and significant findings that we identify  during our review. Rotterdam, February 10, 2021  KPMG Accountants N.V.  J. van Delden RA Reporting scope  The content disclosed in this Annual Report1 is based on  the material topics identified for both ASML and our  stakeholders by the comprehensive materiality assessment  conducted in 2018. As part of the materiality assessment,  we asked internal and external stakeholders to identify  where in the value chain the theme has an impact (see  table in section Non-financial statements - Materiality:  assessing our impact, where we include the boundaries as  required by the GRI Standards). For more information on  the materiality assessment process, see Non-financial  statements - Materiality: assessing our impact. We publish two versions of the Annual Report: one version containing  Financial Statements based on US GAAP and one version containing Financial  Statements based on EU-IFRS. The materiality assessment was used as input for the new  sustainability strategy setting for the period 2019-2025.  New (key) performance indicators have been determined to  report on our performance in the area of sustainability. No  comparative results for 2018 are shown for new indicators  not previously disclosed.   The Reporting scope table (see next page) clarifies the  scope of the data reported per theme and explains where  the scope of the data provided differs from the scope of  the report’s content. Our acquisition of Berliner Glas closed  on October 30, and as a result the non-financial indicators  reported do not include any impact from Berliner Glas. This Annual Report generally covers the performance of  ASML from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. Please  see Who we are and what we do - Our company for  significant changes regarding the size, structure, or  ownership of the organization or its supply chain. The financial information in this report is derived from our  Financial Statements that are in accordance with US GAAP.  The reporting basis for the information in this report on our  performance in the area of sustainability is prepared in  accordance with the GRI Sustainability Reporting  Standards and is presented in accordance with the ‘core’  option. Details of our compliance with the GRI standards  (GRI content index) can be found in a separate Reporting  Supplement available on the Website. We have also  included disclosures required as part of the EU Directive  on disclosure of non-financial information and diversity  information. This disclosure was implemented in 2017 and  is decreed as part of the Dutch Civil Code. Reporting process   Each theme has an owner who is responsible for the theme  ambition, strategy and relevant performance indicators, as  well as the timely delivery of content and relevant data for  reporting and monitoring the execution of the strategy. The  data is reviewed and consolidated by Finance. Finance is  also responsible for the reporting and planning process for  the Annual Report. Reporting indicators   The Consolidated Financial Statements included in this  report are audited. Please see Consolidated Financial  Statements - Report of Independent Registered Public  Accounting Firm. The non-financial data disclosed in this report is derived  from various sources and the way data is processed differs  within our operating subsidiaries and departments. This  causes a degree of uncertainty, because of limitations in  measuring and estimating data. We continue to work on  improving our sustainability control environment and data  collection processes. Scope 3 emissions  One of our reporting indicators is scope 3 emissions.  See What we achieved in 2020 - Climate and energy -  Reviewing our value-chain carbon footprint The emissions reported are in line with the Greenhouse  Gas (GHG) Protocol and are calculated for nine categories,  as described in the Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting  Standard issued by GHG Protocol, which are deemed  relevant to us and our value chain. The categories are:  Cat.1 Purchased goods and services, Cat.2 Capital goods,  Cat.3 Fuel- and energy- related activities, Cat.4 and Cat.9  Upstream /  Downstream transportation & distribution,  Cat.5 Waste generated in operations, Cat.6 Business  travel, Cat.7 Employee commuting, Cat.11 Use of sold  products, and Cat.12 End-of-life treatment of sold  products. The remaining five categories are deemed  irrelevant or immaterial to ASML and our value chain.  Therefore we exclude these categories from our Scope 3  emissions assessment. The applied emission factors used to calculate our value  chain carbon footprint are from the latest DEFRA (UK  Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) 2020  emission factors. Data reliability: The basis for the calculation method  applied for scope 3, Cat.1 Purchased goods and services  is based on spend. As a result, it relies on expenditure- based emission factors, which is an indirect measure of  GHG intensity of goods and services. In addition, we have  gathered actual emissions data from our suppliers for Cat.4  Upstream transportation & distribution and Cat.6 Business  travel, which accounts for around 5% of total Scope 3  emissions. Reporting scope table The below table clarifies the scope of the data reported per theme and explains where the scope of the data provided  differs from the scope of the report’s content. Scope changes  Compared to the 2020 Annual Report, the following scope changes have been made:  • Scholarships in previous years we only reported on the scholarships in the Netherlands but starting from 2020 the  reporting scope will be worldwide.  Verification of this report  As requested by our Board of Management, our non-financial information has been independently reviewed. Our external  auditor (KPMG) was asked to provide this assurance.

From 2019, construction waste is reported as a separate category, because this waste does not result from daily operations of ASML. Amounts of construction  waste tend to fluctuate a lot over the years. Therefore this type of waste is excluded from the waste numbers that are used in the calculation of the other (key) performance indicators for waste reporting.  2. The waste disposal methods are determined by information provided by the waste disposal contractor. 216 ASML ANNUAL REPORT 2020 1. System energy efficiency is measured according to the SEMI S23 standard, and scaled to 100% availability of our systems. In 2016 we started a master-plan period with a target to achieve 111 TJ energy savings by the end of 2020. The savings reported are cumulated compared to base year 2015. The savings are realized by projects resulting in improved technical  installation or by projects resulting in an improved production process. Types of energy included in savings: fuel and electricity.  2. The sources of the conversion factors used are the Dutch Emissions Authority and the US Energy Information Administration.   Throughput  — — 209 277 295 Measured energy efficiency (kWh / wafer pass) 1 — — 0.27 0.38 0.45 In 2020 the definition for emission intensity has changed and is calculated as scope 1,2 and 3 emissions (in kt) divided by total revenue (in millions). The recalculated number for 2019 amounts to 0.56. In 2019 the emission intensity was calculated as  gross scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (in kt) divided by total revenue (in millions). Veldhoven and Linkou are in scope for this indicator. San Diego and Wilton are excluded from the scope because the data to report on the indicator is not yet available.   2.

None of the Speak Up messages led to any indication of violation of anti-corruption laws. Dialogue and knowledge-sharing are important in an innovation-driven industry. To this end, we  continually and openly communicate with our main stakeholder groups through various channels  and at different levels in our organization. Our stakeholders are parties affected by our activities or  those who have a direct interest in or who can influence our company’s long-term business  success. Our materiality process  We develop our materiality assessment framework according to the GRI Standards, which includes principles of  stakeholder engagement and identification, analysis and prioritization. We conduct our materiality assessment through a  three-step approach. We also support the 2030 ambition defined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the  United Nations. These goals aim to protect the planet and improve the lives of people everywhere. We have mapped out  how our strategy and current efforts actively support these goals. The materiality table outlines the five most relevant  SDGs we contribute to. The SDG 9 'Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure' goal is connected to the core of our company,  as innovation is our lifeblood and the engine that drives our business. We also contribute towards the SDG 4 'Quality  Education', SDG 8 'Decent Work and Economic Growth', SDG 12 'Responsible Production and Consumption' and SDG  13 'Climate Action' goals. We highlight our performance against these SDGs throughout this report. We update a shortlist of relevant topics annually.  These are based on an analysis of stakeholder  feedback, continuous stakeholder engagement, risks  and opportunities, and a review of relevant industry  and global trends. Topics include those important to  our stakeholders in their decision-making, and, for  ASML, those that can have an environmental, social  or economic impact, in the organization, value chain  or society. We follow GRI Standards guidelines to rate how  important topics are based on the level of stakeholder  concern, and the significance of our environmental,  social and economic impact resulting from our  business and operations. The results of the materiality assessment are used to  shape our strategy. The results also define the content  of this Annual Report, in line with the GRI principles for  defining report content. Stakeholder engagement: feedback from regular and occasional  stakeholder communication, ESG conferences and networks. Read  more in: Stakeholder engagement We narrow the longlist of topics down to a shortlist of those relevant to us.  The impact of these topics is gauged using available data, feedback from  continuous stakeholder engagement, discussions with senior management and  Board of Management members, business owners, and other relevant internal  stakeholders (such as subject-matter experts). The Board of Management  validates and approves assessment results. We identified the environmental,  social, and governance topics that have the greatest impact on our business,  and are of the greatest concern to stakeholders in our value chain. Read more  in: How we create value. ESG analysts’ questionnaires/assessments: DJSI, Sustainalytics, ISS  ESG rating, CDP, MSCI ESG Index, FTSE4Good, among others. International standards and legislation: GRI, ISO 26000, TCFD, the EU  Non-financial Reporting Directive, among others. Industry and media analysis: RBA, industry development reports,  benchmarking sustainability performance from our peers in the DJSI,  among others. In our latest assessment, conducted in 2018 for the sustainability strategy  2019-2025, we identified 10 material themes for sustainability, summarized in  the materiality table. These are the themes most relevant to our stakeholders in  their decision-making, and in areas where ASML has or could have the highest  impact. We also identified other factors we need to address as a company  committed to conducting our business in an accountable and caring way.  These include issues our stakeholders expect us to act on or issues we have an  impact on. We have been categorized these under the ‘Corporate citizenship’  themes. Read more in: Our strategy. Climate and energy l l l • We are committed to decreasing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  and reducing our carbon footprint across our operations, as well as in our  value chain. • Scope 1, 2, 3 carbon footprint • Energy consumption of our products   Note: The table above refers to the topics in the field of sustainability. Along these topics, other topics such as technology, customer  intimacy, operational excellence are key for the execution of our core business strategy. Corporate governance and financial performance  are part of our annual reporting process. This report focuses, in a comprehensive manner, on the material themes that we disclose. However, as we also want to  meet our stakeholders’ expectations, we seek to address elements of particular interest to them in our corporate  citizenship themes. This means we address themes in different levels of detail. Innovation ecosystem l l l • To maintain our fast pace of innovation, collaboration with our partners in  the value chain, such as suppliers, research institutes and our customer  is key.  • While innovating for our holistic lithography solutions, we need to give  back to society by nurturing young entrepreneurship in the high tech  sector. • Employee engagement is critical to ASML's performance and our long- term success as a company.  • Employee engagement depends on a wide range of factors and activities,  such as talent attraction and retention, the onboarding experience,  leadership, learning and development, and diversity and inclusion.  • Highly skilled people with a technical background are scarce in the labor  market and competition is growing. Employer branding is a vital strategy  to make sure ASML attracts the best talent. • We are committed to the responsible sourcing of parts, components, and  materials in our supply chain. • We screen our supplier base on sustainability performance using the RBA  standard (ethics, labor, health and safety, and environment) Circular economy l l l • We are committed to the responsible use of (natural and other) resources  and scarce materials. • We limit our environmental impact by minimizing waste. • We repurpose products, parts and materials across their lifespan by  recycling and re-use. Managing sustainability  Our Board of Management approves and signs off our Sustainability Strategy. The most senior member of the organization  directly responsible for sustainability matters is our Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, who is a member  of the Board of Management. Each of the material and corporate citizenship themes is assigned to a senior manager, who  is responsible for monitoring progress against agreed targets, and ensuring there are sufficient resources available to meet  targets and objectives. In the event of insufficient progress, this is discussed at operational performance review meetings  and raised with senior management during a review meeting or other relevant committee meetings. Our performance on  sustainability areas, as outlined in the materiality table, is part of the long-term incentive plans of our Board of  Management and senior management. We measure our overall sustainability performance by benchmarking our result  from the annual comprehensive Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) – assessing more than 20 ESG topics – with the  best of the semiconductor industry.

Customers Purpose: We are a manufacturer of leading edge chipmaking equipment, we enable our customers to create the patterns  that define the electronic circuits on a chip. Our customers are the world’s leading microchip manufacturers, and our  success is inextricably linked with theirs. Stakeholder engagement We define stakeholders as those individuals or groups or organizations that can affect or can be affected by our business.  We regard five stakeholder groups: shareholders, customers, suppliers (including contractors), employees and society  (e.g. local community, governments and authorities, industry union, labor organizations, other associations, media and  NGOs). Continuous stakeholder engagement, in which we embrace open dialogue and knowledge-sharing, are important in an  innovation-driven industry and helps us to identify the areas of improvement. We communicate with our stakeholders  through various channels and at a variety of levels. The methods of engagement will vary depending on the stakeholders,  the issues of concern and the purpose of engagement. The following table is an overview of our main stakeholder groups,  the way we communicate with them and an overview of the topics most relevant to them. • Direct interaction with the Investor Relations  department (e.g. calls, ESG performance surveys,  email exchange, site visits - at ASML and/or at the  investor) - [daily] • AGM - [annually] • Investor Day - [bi-annually] • Company quarterly results presentation and press  release - [quarterly] • Various investor conferences and roadshows - [on  occurrence] • Various sustainability questionnaires, assessments and  survey feedback - [on occurrence, the majority of these  are annual recurring] Suppliers Purpose: We rely heavily on our supplier network to achieve the innovations we strive for.

KPMG  Accountants  N.V. KPMG  Network Total KPMG  Accountants  N.V. KPMG  Network Total We lease a number of our facilities under operating leases.  We also own a number of buildings, mainly consisting of  production facilities in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, in  Wilton, Connecticut, and San Diego, California, both in the  US, in Linkou and Tainan, both in Taiwan and in  Pyeongtaek, South Korea. The book value of land and  buildings owned amounts to €1,589.6 million as  of December 31, 2020 compared with  €1,290.2 million as  of December 31, 2019. See Consolidated Financial  Statements - Notes to the Consolidated Financial  Statements - Note 13 Property, plant and equipment, net. Our capital expenditures (purchases of property, plant and  equipment, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash  Flows as recorded in the Consolidated Financial  Statements) for 2020, 2019 and 2018 amounted to €962.0  million, €766.6 million and €574.0 million, respectively. The  increased capital expenditures in 2020 compared to 2019  relates to the expansion and upgrades of facilities,  prototypes, evaluation and training systems. Subject to market conditions, we expect that our capital  expenditures (purchases of property, plant and equipment)  in 2021 will be approximately €1.5 billion. These  expenditures will mainly consist of further expansion and  upgrades of facilities. We expect to finance these capital  expenditures through cash generated by operations and  existing cash and cash equivalents. Facilities in Europe  Our headquarters, main manufacturing and R&D facilities  are located at a single site in Veldhoven, the Netherlands.  This state-of-the-art facility includes 66 thousand square  meters of office space and 50 thousand square meters of  cleanroom used for manufacturing and R&D activities and  24 thousand square meters of warehouses. Our facilities in  Veldhoven, the Netherlands are partly owned and partly  leased. We also lease several sales and service facilities at  locations across Europe. Facilities in the US  Our US head office is located in a 5,000 square meter  office building in Chandler, Arizona. We maintain R&D and  manufacturing operations in a 28,000 square meter facility  in Wilton, Connecticut, and three facilities totaling 41,000  square meters in San Jose, California. Furthermore, our  facilities in San Diego include 25,000 square meters of  buildings used for manufacturing and office space, 19,000  square meters of buildings used for engineering and R&D  activities and 7,000 square meters of buildings used for  warehousing.

Our facility in Hwasung, South Korea  is comprised of a cleanroom (approximately 900 square  meters) and office space (approximately 7,000 square  meters). We also lease and own several sales, service and  training facilities at locations across Asia. As a result of the  Cymer acquisition, we acquired a manufacturing facility in  Pyeongtaek, South Korea, mainly used for refurbishment  activities of light sources. As a result of the HMI acquisition,  we acquired manufacturing facilities in Tainan, Taiwan  (approximately 20,000 square meters) and Beijing, China.  Additionally, both Cymer and HMI lease a few smaller  locations in South Korea and Japan which are mainly used  for local sales and service activities. The statements below represent a summary of current  Dutch tax laws, regulations and judicial interpretations  thereof. The description is limited to the material tax  implications for a holder of ordinary shares who is not, and  / or is not deemed to be, a resident of the Netherlands for  Dutch tax purposes (‘Non-Resident Holder’). This summary  does not address special rules that may apply to special  classes of holders of ordinary shares and should not be  read as extending by implication to matters not specifically  referred to herein. As to individual tax consequences, each  investor in our ordinary shares should consult his or her tax  counsel. General  The acquisition of ordinary shares by a non-resident of the  Netherlands should in itself not be treated as a taxable  event for Dutch tax purposes. The material tax  consequences in connection with owning and disposing of  our ordinary shares are discussed below. Substantial interest  A person that, (inter alia) directly or indirectly, and either  independently or jointly with his partner (as defined in the  Dutch Personal Income Tax Act 2001), owns 5.0% or more  of our share capital, owns profit participating rights that  correspond to at least 5.0% of the annual profits of a Dutch  company or to at least 5.0% of the liquidation proceeds of  such company or holds options to purchase 5.0% or more  of our share capital, is deemed to have a substantial  interest in our shares, or our options, as applicable.  Specific rules apply in case certain family members of the  Non-Resident Holder hold a substantial interest. A deemed  substantial interest also exists if (part of) a substantial  interest has been disposed of, or is deemed to be  disposed of, in a transaction where no taxable gain has  been recognized. Specific attribution rules exist in  determining the presence of a substantial interest. • The holder carries on a business in the Netherlands  through a permanent establishment or a permanent  representative in the Netherlands (Dutch enterprise) and  the ordinary shares are attributable to this permanent  establishment or permanent representative, unless the  participation exemption (discussed below) applies; or  • The holder has a substantial interest in our share capital,  which is held with the primary aim or one of the primary  aims to avoid the levy of income tax at the level of  another person and which is not put into place with valid  commercial reasons that reflect economic reality; or  • The holder is a resident of Aruba, Curacao or Saint  Martin with a permanent establishment or permanent  representative in Bonaire, Eustatius or Saba to which  our ordinary shares are attributable and certain  conditions are met; or  • Certain assets of the holder are deemed to be treated as  a Dutch enterprise under Dutch tax law and the ordinary  shares are attributable to this Dutch enterprise. To qualify for the Dutch participation exemption, the holder  must generally hold at least 5.0% of our nominal paid-in  capital and meet certain other requirements. Dividend withholding tax  In general, a dividend distributed by us in respect of our  ordinary shares will be subject to a withholding tax  imposed by the Netherlands at the statutory rate of 15.0%. Dividends include:  • Dividends in cash and in kind;  • Deemed and constructive dividends;  • Consideration for the repurchase or redemption of  ordinary shares (including a purchase by a direct  or indirect ASML subsidiary) in excess of qualifying  average paid-in capital unless such repurchase is made  for temporary investment purposes or is exempt by law;  • Stock dividends up to their nominal value (unless  distributed out of qualifying paid-in capital);  • Any (partial) repayment of paid-in capital not qualifying  as capital for Dutch dividend withholding tax purposes;  and  • Liquidation proceeds in excess of qualifying average  paid-in capital for Dutch dividend withholding tax  purposes. • Does not carry out and has not carried out any activities  which generate taxable profit in the Netherlands or  taxable income in the Netherlands to which the holding  of our ordinary shares was connected. Under certain circumstances, a reduction of Dutch  dividend withholding tax can be obtained:  • An exemption at source is available if the participation  exemption applies and the ordinary shares are  attributable to a business carried out in the Netherlands;  • An exemption at source is available for dividend  distributions to certain qualifying EU/EEA resident  corporate holders, unless such holder holds our ordinary  shares with the primary aim or one of the primary aims  to avoid the levy of Dutch dividend withholding tax at  the level of another person and our ordinary shares  are not held for valid commercial reasons that reflect  economic reality;  • An exemption at source is available for dividend  distributions to certain qualifying corporate holders that  are a resident of a non-EU/EEA jurisdiction with which  the Netherlands has concluded a tax treaty that includes  a dividend article, unless such holder holds our ordinary  shares with the primary aim or one of the primary aims  to avoid the levy of Dutch dividend withholding tax at  the level of another person and our ordinary shares  are not held for valid commercial reasons that reflect  economic reality;  • Certain tax exempt organizations (e.g. pension funds  and excluding collective investment vehicles) resident  in EU/EEA member states or in qualifying non-EU/EEA  states may be eligible for a refund of Dutch dividend  withholding tax upon their request. Based on domestic  law not yet entered into force, in those circumstances,  an exemption at source may also become available  upon request;  • Upon request and under certain conditions, certain  qualifying Non-Resident Individual and Corporate  Holders of ordinary shares resident in EU/EEA member  states or in a qualifying non-EU/EEA state may be  eligible for a refund of Dutch dividend withholding tax  insofar the withholding tax levied is higher than the  personal and corporate income tax which would have  been due if they were resident of the Netherlands. Furthermore, a Non-Resident Holder of ordinary shares can  be eligible for a partial or complete exemption or refund of  all or a portion of the above withholding tax under a tax  treaty that is in effect between the Netherlands and the  Non-Resident Holder’s country of residence. The  Netherlands has concluded such treaties with the US,  Canada, Switzerland, Japan, most EU member states, as  well as many other countries. Under the treaty between the  US and the Netherlands for the Avoidance of Double  Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect  to Taxes on Income (the ‘US Tax Treaty’), dividends paid by  us to a Non-Resident Holder that is a resident of the US as  defined in the US Tax Treaty (other than an exempt  organization or exempt pension trust, as discussed below)  are generally liable to 15.0% Dutch withholding tax or, in  the case of certain US corporate shareholders owning  directly at least 10.0% of our voting power, a reduction to  5.0%, provided that the Holder is the beneficial owner of  the dividends received and does not have an enterprise or  an interest in an enterprise that is, in whole or in part,  carried on through a permanent establishment or  permanent representative in the Netherlands to which the  dividends are attributable. The US Tax Treaty also provides  for a dividend withholding tax exemption on dividends, but  only for a shareholder owning directly at least 80.0% of our  voting power and meeting all other requirements. The US  Tax Treaty provides for a complete exemption from tax on  dividends received by exempt pension trusts and exempt Dividend stripping rules  Under Dutch tax legislation regarding anti-dividend  stripping, no exemption from, or refund of, Dutch dividend  withholding tax is granted if the recipient of dividends paid  by us is not considered the beneficial owner of such  dividends. Gift or inheritance taxes  Dutch gift or inheritance taxes will not be levied on the  transfer of ordinary shares by way of gift or upon the death  of a Non-Resident Holder, unless the transfer is construed  as an inheritance or as a gift made by or on behalf of a  person, who at the time of the gift or death, is deemed to  be resident of the Netherlands. Gift tax and inheritance tax are levied on the beneficiary.  For purposes of Dutch gift and inheritance tax, an  individual of Dutch nationality is deemed to be a resident of  the Netherlands if he/she has been a resident thereof at  any time during the ten years preceding the time of the gift  or death. For purposes of Dutch gift tax, a person not  possessing Dutch nationality is deemed to be a resident of  the Netherlands if he / she has resided therein at any time  in the twelve months preceding the gift. Value added tax  No Dutch VAT is imposed on dividends in respect of our  ordinary shares or on the transfer of our shares. Residence  A Non-Resident Holder will not become resident, or be  deemed to be resident, in the Netherlands solely as a result  of holding our ordinary shares or of the execution,  performance, delivery and / or enforcement of rights in  respect of our ordinary shares. US taxation  The following is a discussion of the material US federal  income tax consequences relating to the acquisition,  ownership and disposition of ordinary shares by a United  States Holder (as defined below) acting in the capacity of a  beneficial owner who is not a tax resident of the  Netherlands. This discussion deals only with ordinary  shares held as capital assets and does not deal with the  tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors,  some of which (such as tax-exempt entities, financial  institutions, regulated investment companies, dealers in organizations, as defined therein. Except in the case of  exempt organizations, the reduced dividend withholding  tax rate (or exemption from withholding) can be applied at  the source upon payment of the dividends, provided that  the proper forms have been filed in advance of the  payment. Exempt organizations, in principle, remain  subject to the statutory withholding rate of 15.0% and are  required to file for a refund of such withholding, however  such organizations may become eligible for the exemption  at source when the domestic law as described above has  entered into force. A Non-Resident Holder may not claim the benefits of the  US Tax Treaty unless (i) he/she is a resident of the US as  defined therein, or (ii) he/she is deemed to be a resident on  the basis of the provisions of article 24(4) of the US Tax  Treaty, and (iii) his or her entitlement to those benefits is not  limited by the provisions of article 26 (limitation on benefits)  of the US Tax Treaty. securities/traders in securities that elect a mark-to-market  method of accounting for securities holdings, insurance  companies, investors owning directly, indirectly or  constructively 10.0% or more of our outstanding voting  shares, investors who hold ordinary shares as part of  hedging or conversion transactions and investors whose  functional currency is not the US dollar) may be subject to  special rules. In addition, the discussion does not address  any alternative minimum tax or any state, local, Foreign  Investment in Real Property Tax Act-related US federal  income tax consequences, or non-US tax consequences. This discussion is based on the US-Netherlands Income  tax treaty, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended  to the date hereof, final, temporary and proposed Treasury  Department regulations promulgated, and administrative  and judicial interpretations thereof, changes to any of  which subsequent to the date hereof, possibly with  retroactive effect, may affect the tax consequences  described herein. In addition, there can be no assurance  that the IRS will not challenge one or more of the tax  consequences described herein, and we have not  obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS  or an opinion of counsel with respect to the US federal  income tax consequences of acquiring or holding shares.  Prospective purchasers of ordinary shares are advised to  consult their tax advisers with respect to their particular  circumstances and with respect to the effects of US  federal, state, local or non-US tax laws to which they may  be subject.  As used herein, the term ‘United States Holder’ means a  beneficial owner of ordinary shares for US federal income  tax purposes whose holding of such ordinary shares does  not form part of the business property or assets of a  permanent establishment or fixed base in the Netherlands;  who is fully entitled to the benefits of the treaty in respect  of such ordinary shares; and is:  • An individual citizen or tax resident of the US; or  • A corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for  US federal income tax purposes created or organized  in or under the laws of the US or of any political  subdivision thereof; or  • An estate of which the income is subject to US federal  income taxation regardless of its source; or  • A trust whose administration is subject to the primary  supervision of a court within the US and which has one  or more US persons who have the authority to control all  of its substantial decisions. If an entity treated as a partnership for US federal income  tax purposes owns ordinary shares, the US federal income  tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally  depend upon the status and tax residency of the partner  and the activities of the partnership. A partnership that  owns ordinary shares and the partners in such partnership  should consult their tax advisors about the US federal  income tax consequences of holding and disposing of the  ordinary shares. Passive Foreign Investment Company  considerations  We believe we were not a passive foreign investment  company for US federal income tax purposes in 2020 and  that we will not be a passive foreign investment company  in 2021. However, as passive foreign investment company  status is a factual matter that must be determined annually  at the close of each taxable year, there can be no certainty Taxation of dividends  United States Holders should generally include in gross  income, as foreign-source dividend income the gross  amount of any non-liquidating distribution (before reduction  for Dutch withholding taxes) we make out of our current or  accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US  federal income tax purposes) when the distribution is  actually or constructively received by the United States  Holder. Distributions will not be eligible for the dividends- received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in  respect of dividends received from other US corporations.  The amount of the dividend distribution includible in  income of a United States Holder should be the US dollar  value of the foreign currency (e.g. euros) paid, determined  by the spot rate of exchange on the date of the distribution,  regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into  US dollars. Distributions in excess of current and  accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US  federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non- taxable return of capital to the extent of the United States  Holder’s US tax basis in the ordinary shares and thereafter  as taxable capital gain. We presently do not maintain  calculations of our earnings and profits under US federal  income tax principles. If we do not report to a United  States Holder the portion of a distribution that exceeds  earnings and profits, the distribution will generally be  taxable as a dividend even if that distribution would  otherwise be treated as a non-taxable return of capital or  as capital gain under the rules described above. Subject to limitations provided in the US Internal Revenue  Code, a United States Holder may generally deduct from  its US federal taxable income, or credit against its US  federal income tax liability, the amount of qualified Dutch  withholding taxes. However, Dutch withholding tax may be  credited only if the United States Holder does not claim a  deduction for any Dutch or other non-US taxes paid or  accrued in that year. In addition, Dutch dividend  withholding taxes will likely not be creditable against the  United States Holder’s US tax liability to the extent we are  not required to pay over the amount withheld to the Dutch  Tax Administration. Currently, a Dutch corporation that  receives dividends from qualifying non-Dutch subsidiaries  may credit source country tax withheld from those  dividends against Dutch withholding tax imposed on a  dividend paid by a Dutch corporation, up to a maximum of  3.0% of the dividend paid by the Dutch corporation. The  credit reduces the amount of dividend withholding that we  are required to pay to the Dutch Tax Administration but  does not reduce the amount of tax we are required to  withhold from dividends. For US foreign tax credit purposes, dividends paid by us  generally will be treated as foreign-source income and as  ‘passive category income’ (or in the case of certain holders,  as ‘general category income’). Gains or losses realized by a  United States Holder on the sale or exchange of ordinary as to our actual passive foreign investment company  status in any particular year until the close of the taxable  year in question. We have not conducted a detailed study  at this time to confirm our non-passive foreign investment  company status. If we were treated as a passive foreign  investment company in any year during which a United  States Holder owned common shares, certain adverse tax  consequences could apply. Investors should consult their  tax advisors with respect to any passive foreign investment  company considerations. shares generally will be treated as US-source gain or loss.  The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex and  we suggest that each United States Holder consult his or  her own tax advisor to determine whether, and to what  extent, a foreign tax credit will be available. Dividends received by a United States Holder will generally  be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. However, the Jobs  and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, as  amended by the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004,  the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the American  Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, and most recently the 2017  tax reform act (Public Law No. 115-97) reduces to 20.0%  the maximum tax rate for certain dividends received by  individuals, so long as certain exclusions do not apply and  the stock has been held for at least 60 days during the  121-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend  date. Dividends received from ‘qualified foreign  corporations’ generally qualify for the reduced rate. A non- US corporation (other than a passive foreign investment  company) generally will be considered to be a qualified  foreign corporation if: (i) the shares of the non-US  corporation are readily tradable on an established  securities market in the US or (ii) the non-US corporation is  eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax  treaty with the US that has been identified as a qualifying  treaty and contains an exchange of information program. In  addition, subject to income limitations, dividends received  by US individuals and US residents, estates and trusts will  be subject to a Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) assessed  at the rate of 3.8%.  Individual United States Holders  should consult their tax advisors regarding the impact of  this provision on their particular situations. Dividends paid by us generally will constitute ‘portfolio  income’ for purposes of the limitations on the use of  passive activity losses (and, therefore, generally may not be  offset by passive activity losses) and as ‘investment  income’ for purposes of the limitation on the deduction of  investment interest expense. Information reporting and backup  withholding  Information returns may be filed with the IRS in connection  with payments on the ordinary shares or proceeds from a  sale, redemption or other disposition of the ordinary  shares. A ‘backup withholding’ tax may be applied to, and  withheld from, these payments if the beneficial owner fails  to provide a correct taxpayer identification number to the  paying agent and to comply with certain certification  procedures or otherwise establish an exemption from  backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the  backup withholding rules might be refunded (or credited  against the beneficial owner’s US federal income tax  liability, if any) depending on the facts and provided that  the required information is furnished to the IRS. The discussion set out above is included for general  information only and may not be applicable depending  upon a holder’s particular situation. Holders should consult  their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences to  them of the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares  including the tax consequences under state, local and  other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in US  federal and other tax laws. (determined at the spot rate on the settlement date of the  sale) if proceeds are paid in currency other than the US  dollar, as the case may be, and the United States Holder’s  US tax basis (determined in US dollars) in such ordinary  shares. Generally, the capital gain or loss will be long-term  capital gain or loss if the holding period of the United  States Holder in the ordinary shares exceeds one year at  the time of the sale or other disposition. The deductibility of  capital losses is subject to limitations for US federal income  tax purposes. Gain or loss from the sale or other  disposition of ordinary shares generally will be treated as  US source income or loss for US foreign tax credit  purposes. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from  currency fluctuations during the period between the date of  the sale of the ordinary shares and the date the sale  proceeds are converted into US dollars will be treated as  ordinary income or loss from sources within the US. Each  United States Holder should consult his or her tax advisor  with regard to the translation rules applicable when  computing its adjusted US tax basis and the amount  realized upon a sale or other disposition of its ordinary  shares if purchased in, or sold or disposed of for, a  currency other than US dollar. Our business is subject to direct and indirect regulations in  each of the countries in which our customers or we do  business, and changes in various types of regulations can  affect our business adversely. As our business has  expanded, we have become subject to increasing and  increasingly complex regulation. The implementation of  new safety, environmental or legal requirements, including  export controls and required permits and licenses or  changes in interpretation, implementation or enforcement  of such regulations and requirements, could impact our  products, our manufacturing or distribution processes or location of sales, and could affect the timing of product  introductions, the cost of our production, and products as  well as their commercial success in each market in which  we operate. The impact of these regulations could  adversely affect our business, financial condition and our  results of operations even where the specific regulations  do not directly apply to us or to our products. See How we  manage risk - Risk factors - Legal and compliance - We are  subject to increasingly complex regulatory and compliance  obligations. Our ordinary shares are listed for trading in the form of  registered ASML NASDAQ shares and in the form of  registered ASML Euronext Amsterdam shares. The  principal trading market of our ordinary shares is Euronext  Amsterdam (trading symbol: ASML). Our ordinary shares  also trade on NASDAQ (trading symbol: ASML). Our shares listed on NASDAQ are registered with  JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., our New York Transfer Agent,  pursuant to the terms of the Transfer Agent Agreement  between ASML and JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. Our  shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam are held in  dematerialized form through the facilities of Euroclear  Nederland, the Dutch centralized securities custody and  administration system. The New York Transfer Agent  charges shareholders a fee of up to USD 5.00 per 100  shares for the exchange of our shares listed at NASDAQ  for our shares listed at Euronext Amsterdam and vice  versa. by the Board of Management. The resulting amounts are  distributed through the New York Transfer Agent and no  charge is payable by holders of our shares listed at  NASDAQ in connection with this conversion or distribution. Pursuant to the terms of the Transfer Agent Agreement, we  have agreed to reimburse the New York Transfer Agent for  certain out of pocket expenses, including in connection  with any mailing of notices, reports or other  communications made generally available by ASML to  holders of ordinary shares. The New York Transfer Agent  has waived its fees associated with routine services to  ASML associated with our shares listed at NASDAQ. In  addition, the New York Transfer Agent in consideration of  its acting as Transfer Agent has agreed to make a  contribution towards covering certain expenses incurred by  ASML in connection with the issuance and transfer of our  shares listed on NASDAQ. In the year ended December 31,  2020, the Transfer Agent contributed USD 0.4  million towards coverage of expenses incurred by ASML  (which mainly comprised of audit, advisory, legal and listing  fees incurred due to the existence of our share listing on  NASDAQ). In February 2019, ASML entered into a settlement and  license agreement with Nikon Corporation and Carl Zeiss  SMT, and for purposes of certain provisions Carl Zeiss AG.  The agreement settles all pending litigation between ASML  and Zeiss on the one hand and Nikon on the other hand  and provides for a patent cross license between ASML,  Zeiss and Nikon. The key terms of the cross-license are set  forth below. (iii) Nikon grants Zeiss a worldwide, non-exclusive license  under all Nikon Licensed Patents to make, use and sell a)  components for use in lithography equipment and b)  certain digital cameras developed and marketed by Zeiss,  but excluding FPD/large area substrate products (“Zeiss  Licensed Products”). These license grants cover existing patents, as well as  additional patents that issue worldwide before the end of  the term of the cross-license. Term of License  The term of the cross-license is 10 years from the date of  the cross-license agreement, February 18, 2019. ASML  and Zeiss, jointly on the one hand and Nikon on the other  hand, each have the right to convert up to 20 Licensed  Patent families of the other side into permanently Licensed  Patents. Post-Term After the term of the cross-license, remedies for any party's  infringement of any patents with an effective application  date before the end of the term of the cross-license are  limited to damages in the form of a reasonable royalty  applied against a royalty base that is apportioned to reflect  the value of such patent features and excluding from the  base value attributable to unpatented features. Whether a  Licensed Product infringes a Licensed Patent, all defenses  to such a claim, and any such reasonable royalty in the  event liability is found shall be determined by a court  mutually agreed by the parties. Certain Releases  The parties have granted each other releases for claims of  infringement of Licensed Patents based on acts prior to the  date of the agreement. Immunity  ASML and Nikon have granted each other certain  immunities from patent suits by the other party in respect  of covered entities, including customers, subject to certain  defensive rights. Payments  ASML and Zeiss agreed that ASML pays a total of  €150.0 million to Nikon. ASML and Zeiss agreed that ASML pays Nikon a royalty of  0.8% of the net sales price of entire immersion lithography  systems (on the first sale of each system) that are ASML  Licensed Products sold during the term of the agreement. Nikon agreed to pay ASML a royalty of 0.8% of the net  sales price of entire immersion lithography systems (on the  first sale of each system) that are Nikon Licensed Products  sold during the term of the agreement.

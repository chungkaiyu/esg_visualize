Petrella Chair: Peter C. Wallace Fiscal 2020 had its share of challenges, but it also brought opportunities. Many have used the word unprecedented to describe  recent events and the subsequent business environment we have experienced. Here at Applied®, the word unwavering stands out,  as it characterizes the dedication of our associates during these challenging times brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. While COVID has reset the stage in many ways, we know how we respond determines our performance… and success. Across our  business, we have implemented operational procedures and followed guidelines from the CDC and other health organizations. Through  social distancing, virtual meetings and sales calls, distance learning and more, we have remained productive and have learned many best  practices along the way – all in an effort to serve our customers and keep industry running. I am incredibly proud of our teamwork and innovation which allow us to proactively and effectively respond across many industries  where we play a key role in keeping the industrial infrastructure running productively. Our track record of operational discipline  while preserving our capability to serve is once again apparent in this environment. This was highlighted in fiscal 2020 as we  controlled costs and margins, generated record cash, and enhanced our balance sheet despite the softer demand environment. We understand our requirements and know how to manage through any part of the cycle. More than ever before, our comprehensive portfolio of products and services – combined with our specialized  expertise and know-how – is bridging today’s challenges with tomorrow’s opportunities. » EPS of $0.62; Non-GAAP adjusted EPS of $3.81   » Sales of $3.2 billion » Reduced net debt by 22% year-over-year(b) down 13.5% year-over-year(a) down 6.5% year-over-year and down 9.4%  organically, reflecting the softer economic  environment and impact from COVID-19 (a) Please refer to the section entitled “Reconciliation of Net income per share to Adjusted net income per share” on the inside back cover.

AND SUBSIDIARIES     |    2020 ANNUAL REPORT » Returned $48.9 million to shareholders » Raised quarterly dividend to $0.32 customer-facing associates $2. operations of $296.7 million up 64% year-over-year From the onset of the pandemic, we were classified as  an essential business supporting the important industrial  infrastructure with critical products and services. Our  facilities remained open and operational through the  various shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, while  adhering to health and safety protocols. With more  than 50% of our service center network demand tied  to break-fix requirements, customers depend on us  for critical parts, services and solutions that sustain  operations and support vital areas of the economy.  For some customers, a slowdown prompts incremental  maintenance on their direct production infrastructure  and systems, and we remain a valued partner in  supporting their engineering and maintenance teams in  addressing related needs. 2 The resilient nature of our value proposition is apparent  across other facets of our Company as well. This  includes providing leading fluid power solutions such  as advanced electronic control integration supporting  greater safety and precision of industrial equipment,  as well as pneumatic solutions facilitating various areas  of technology and life sciences. Today’s environment  is also prompting us to identify new opportunities  through our specialty flow control capabilities, as  well as complementary consumables and emerging  automation technologies. Olympus Controls, acquired  in August 2019, is providing many relevant and  timely opportunities, including ventilator innovation,  autonomous UV-C cleaning technology, contact tracing  and proximity tools, and more. We have proven to be  valuable on multiple fronts. Targeted investments in recent years have positioned Applied as the leading distributor of technical solutions  across the industrial supply chain. This has differentiated  our value proposition and will continue to be ever  more relevant as the industrial economy starts its next  phase of growth with increasing supply chain and  technical requirements. As industrial equipment and  facility infrastructure continues to ramp, it will increase  critical break-fix demand across our network, where  we can respond with local expertise and the most  comprehensive suite of motion control technologies   and services within our industry… and in our   Company’s history. Additionally, behaviors reshaped by the pandemic  will reinforce secular growth opportunities tied  to our technical service and engineered solutions  portfolio, which has become a greater portion of  our business in recent years. In particular, we believe  customers will increasingly focus on addressing  skilled labor constraints, plant efficiency, and  regulatory requirements, while considerations around manufacturing re-shoring and U.S. industrial  infrastructure have potential to gain momentum.  Ultimately, this could accelerate customers’ outsourcing  of technical MRO and service needs, investments in  automation, and the consolidation of market share  toward leading distribution platforms given increasing  service, operational and capital requirements. As a value-added business partner, we continue to  look for new and innovative ways to work with our  customers and suppliers to maximize productivity  and investment returns. Emerging technologies have  demonstrated encouraging capabilities in helping  reduce downtime and MRO costs through a network  of sensors, smart devices and machine learning  algorithms. This data and digitization movement –  often referred to as the Industrial Internet of Things  (IIoT) – has been steadily building momentum  throughout the industrial and manufacturing sectors.  Through the Applied IoT ConnectTM Program, we  continue to develop the best ways to leverage these offerings and implement solutions for  connected operations. We are also leveraging technology and data internally for continuous improvement and team collaboration  on staying “close” to our customers and executing  business during these times. Our Applied Maintenance  Supplies & SolutionsSM team has introduced virtual  ordering by integrating a video conferencing app  to scan product bins and place orders, providing a  contactless and touchless ordering option. Furthermore,  we are strengthening our Applied.com channel and  digital sales capabilities through chat assistance  and engagement initiatives, further enhancing our  customers’ procurement experience and driving new  growth opportunities. Across our organization, we have many significant and exciting near-term opportunities to productively and  effectively impact our customers and the important  industrial infrastructure. A focus on living the Applied    Core Values is reinforced in this business climate, further  supporting our efforts and helping to generate success  for our customers and Applied. These values continue to influence how we engage new  end users, fellow associates, suppliers, communities,  and other important stakeholders. We have received  letters from customers across our globally-served  industries acknowledging our support and the value we  provide. Our core values are also fundamental to our  Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices,  which emphasize Corporate Governance; Supply  Chain Management; Environmental, Health & Safety;  Sustainability Initiatives; and our Corporate Citizenship &  Human Rights Statement. From our foundation as a distributor and related low carbon footprint, to advising customers on energy savings  and eco-friendly products, we play an important role in  supporting the environment. Additionally, we continue  to have an opportunity – and collective responsibility – to  further develop plans, actions and results that promote  fair, honest and ethical practices across our business.  We are proud to note that we have been ranked  among the top 15 of Ohio Fortune 1000 companies  for Diversity in Corporate Governance, according to a  recent report from the National Diversity Council. I firmly believe  our best days  are ahead! We Are AppliedSM, and we have a strong foundation,  expanding capabilities and outstanding potential as the  leading technical products, services and solutions provider  to industrial markets. As we enter fiscal 2021, we see  significant opportunity as we leverage our industry position  to effectively adapt to the evolving industrial landscape, and  invest in new and emerging growth opportunities. While we are facing some challenges as the industrial economy transitions from a generational pandemic, we  have a remarkably strong business model that generates  cash and adapts well throughout the cycle, as we have  demonstrated. Our strategy is deeply focused on the  opportunities ahead of us and moving the Company  toward its long-term financial goals for significant earnings  growth and value creation in the coming years. With our  100-year anniversary approaching, I firmly believe our best  days are ahead! Thank you for your continued support. On behalf of all of  us at Applied, we wish you all the best during this time. Neil A. Schrimsher  President & Chief Executive Officer Working Together,  Winning Together!

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS  Information regarding developments in our business can be found in  Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”   This information is incorporated here by reference. VALUE PROPOSITION We serve a segment of the industrial distribution market that requires technical expertise and service given that our  products and solutions are directly tied to industrial companies’ production and efﬁciency initiatives.  As such, we  believe we are integral to our customers’ supply chains considering the critical nature and direct exposure our  solutions have on our customers’ core production equipment and plant capabilities.  While we compete with other  distributors and service providers offering products and solutions addressing this area of the industrial supply chain,  we believe our industry position and value proposition beneﬁts from relative advantages tied to the following key  attributes: We focus on helping customers minimize their production downtime, improve machine performance, and reduce  overall procurement and maintenance costs.  A primary focus for our service center network is responding to a  critical “break-ﬁx” situation, which requires knowledge of a customer’s facility, localized inventory, timely delivery  capabilities, service execution, and accountability.  In addition, our ﬂuid power, ﬂow control, and automation  operations design, engineer, and integrate solutions focused on making a customer’s operations and equipment  more productive, cost-efﬁcient, and automated.  We believe our products and solutions are increasingly critical within the industrial supply chain given an aging and tighter customer labor force, more sophisticated production  equipment and processes, a greater focus on plant ﬂoor optimization, and compliance and regulatory requirements. INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION We primarily compete within North America which we believe offers signiﬁcant growth potential given our industry  position, established distribution and sales network, market fragmentation, and customer technical requirements, as  well as opportunities tied to automation and smart technologies.  Growth within our industry is inﬂuenced by  broader industrial production and capacity utilization, as well as inﬂation, labor dynamics, capital spending,  geopolitical events, factory optimization initiatives, changes in industrial equipment technologies, and supply chain  requirements. Our principal competitors are specialist and general line distributors of bearings, power transmission products, ﬂuid  power components and systems, ﬂow control solutions, industrial rubber products, and linear motion components,  and to a lesser extent providers of tools, safety products, and other industrial and maintenance supplies.  These  competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational operations.  We also compete with original  equipment manufacturers and integrators.  The identity and number of our competitors vary throughout the  geographic, industry, and product markets we serve. STRATEGIC GROWTH AND OPERATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES •  Capture market share across our core service center network.  Our network of service centers located  close to industrial companies allows us to respond quickly and effectively to critical MRO situations involving  direct production infrastructure and industrial equipment.  We believe more sophisticated industrial production  processes, customer labor constraints, and increased manufacturing activity across North America could drive  greater demand for our products and services.  We continue to deploy initiatives to further enhance our  capabilities across our service center network and gain market share.  These include investments in analytics,  strategic account penetration, sales process optimization, talent development, and digital capabilities, as well as  fully leveraging and cross-selling our expanded product and service platform across ﬂuid power, ﬂow control,  automation, and consumables solutions. •  Execute ongoing operational initiatives supporting margin proﬁle.  We have a number of initiatives  focused on driving operational improvements throughout the organization.  Systems investments in recent  years including common ERP platforms are supporting opportunities in leveraging shared services, reﬁning our  sales management process, and standardizing pricing and sourcing functions, while we continue to optimize  our shop and distribution network and analytics.  We also remain focused on achieving margin synergies across  our operations following expansion into ﬂow control and automation.  This includes enhanced pricing  functions, leveraging vendor procurement, freight savings, and reﬁned cost management.  Combined with  growth in more proﬁtable areas of our business, we see ongoing opportunity to optimize our margin proﬁle  and cash generation in coming years. •  Pursue acquisitions to supplement growth and strengthen industry position.  We expect to pursue  additional acquisitions aligned with our growth strategy and long-term ﬁnancial targets.  We view acquisitions •  Leverage technical industry position in developing growth around emerging industrial technologies.   We believe we are positioned to capture emerging opportunities relating to automation and smart technologies  focused on optimizing and connecting customers’ industrial supply chains.  Our position reﬂects our technical  product focus, service capabilities, embedded customer relationships and knowledge across direct production  infrastructure and equipment, and existing supplier relationships.  Following our acquisition of Olympus  Controls in ﬁscal 2020, we now offer products and solutions focused on the design, assembly, integration, and  distribution of motion control, machine vision, and robotic technologies.  We expect to continue to expand our  automation footprint and capabilities in coming years, as well as pursue opportunities tied to the Industrial  Internet of Things (IIoT).  We believe this market potential could be meaningful as technology continues to  converge within traditional industrial supply chains and end-markets. •  Extend our leading ﬂuid power and ﬂow control position as demand for comprehensive solutions  grows.  We provide innovative ﬂuid power and ﬂow control solutions including systems design and  engineering, electronic control integration, software programing, valve actuation, compliance consulting,  fabrication and assembly, and dedicated service and repair.  Demand for these solutions is increasing across a  variety of industrial, off-highway mobile, technology, and process related applications given a greater focus on  power consumption, plant efﬁciency and automation, emissions control, remote monitoring, advancements in  machining, regulatory and compliance standards, and data analytics.  We believe our service and engineering  capabilities, shop network, and supplier relationships are key competitive advantages supporting our ability to  capture a greater share of this market growth opportunity in coming years. OPERATIONS Our distribution and sales network consists of approximately 460 locations in our Service Center Distribution  segment and 120 locations in our Fluid Power & Flow Control segment.  This includes service centers, distribution  centers, and facilities tied to our ﬂuid power, ﬂow control, and automation operations.  Our service centers resemble  local inventory hubs located in close proximity to our customers and focused primarily on MRO related fulﬁllment  and service needs.  Our ﬂuid power, ﬂow control, and automation locations support technical and shop-oriented  services integral to the more specialized and integrated nature of the products and solutions they provide.  Other  operations and channels we market through include inventory management services for indirect consumable supplies  and digital solutions including our Applied.com website, electronic data interchange (EDI) and other electronic  interfaces with customers' technology platforms and plant maintenance systems. Our distribution centers provide daily service to our service centers, helping replenish inventories and shipping  products directly to customers where appropriate.  An efﬁcient supply chain and timely delivery of our products is  vital to our value proposition particularly when customers require products for emergency repairs.  We utilize  dedicated third-party transportation providers, our own delivery vehicles, as well as surface and air common carrier  and courier services.  Customers may also pick up items at our service centers.  We maintain product inventory levels  at each service center tailored to the local market.  These inventories consist of standard items as well as other items  speciﬁc to local customer demand. Our operations are primarily based in the U.S. where 87% of our ﬁscal 2020 sales were generated.  We also have  international operations, the largest of which is in Canada (8% of ﬁscal 2020 sales) with the balance (5% of ﬁscal  2020 sales) in Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. SUPPLIERS We are a leading distributor of products including bearings, power transmission products, engineered ﬂuid power  components and systems, specialty ﬂow control solutions, machinery and robotics automation products, industrial  rubber products, linear motion components, tools, safety products, and other industrial and maintenance supplies. These products are generally supplied to us by manufacturers whom we serve as a non-exclusive distributor.  The  suppliers also may provide us product training, as well as sales and marketing support.  Authorizations to represent  particular suppliers and product lines vary by geographic region, particularly for our ﬂuid power and ﬂow control  businesses.  We believe our supplier relationships are generally good, and many have existed for decades.  The  disruption of relationships with certain suppliers, or the disruption of their operations, could adversely affect our  business. Our product suppliers typically conﬁne their direct sales activities to large-volume transactions, mainly with large  original equipment manufacturers.  The suppliers generally do not sell maintenance and repair products directly to  the customer, but instead refer the customer to us or another distributor. MARKETS  We purchase from thousands of product manufacturers and resell the products to thousands of customers in a wide  variety of industries, including agriculture and food processing, cement, chemicals and petrochemicals, fabricated  metals, forest products, industrial machinery and equipment, mining, oil and gas, primary metals, transportation, and  utilities, as well as to government entities.  Customers range from very large businesses, with which we may have  multiple-location relationships, to very small ones.  We are not signiﬁcantly dependent on a single customer or group  of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business as a whole, and no single  customer accounts for more than 3% of our ﬁscal 2020 sales. SERVICES We believe part of our success, differentiation, and competitive advantage is attributable to the comprehensive set of  services and solutions we provide, which we view as critical given the technical nature and application of our core  product offering of motion, power, control, and automation technologies.  The foundation of our service capabilities  lies with our technically oriented associate team, which includes engineers, industry segment specialists, mechanics,  technicians, ﬂuid power specialists, as well as our systems, shop network, and supplier relationships.  We believe  knowledge and service capabilities relating to our core product offering are increasingly needed across our customer  base given skilled labor constraints within their operations, maintenance requirements, and more sophisticated plant  equipment and processes.  Our services and solutions help customers minimize production downtime, improve as an important growth consideration given high fragmentation, greater operational and technical  requirements, and supplier authorizations within the markets we serve.  We believe our sourcing strategy, cash  generation capabilities, and operational discipline are key to our acquisition success.  Over the near to  intermediate-term, our acquisition priorities are focused on continuing to expand our current offerings, while  further enhancing our technical differentiation and value-added service capabilities. The segment includes operations focused on certain end markets and indirect consumable supplies through vendor  managed inventory solutions, as well as regional fabricated rubber shops and service ﬁeld crews, which install,  modify, and repair conveyor belts and rubber linings, and make hose assemblies in accordance with customer  requirements. Fluid Power & Flow Control.  Our Fluid Power & Flow Control segment includes our operations that specialize in  distributing, engineering, designing, integrating, and repairing hydraulic and pneumatic ﬂuid power technologies,  and engineered ﬂow control products and services.  We believe we are the largest distributor and solutions provider  of ﬂuid power and industrial ﬂow control products and solutions in the U.S.  The segment also includes our  operations that focus on robotic and machinery automation solutions following the acquisition of Olympus Controls  in August 2019. Our ﬂuid power operations offer products and services primarily used within industrial, off-highway mobile, and  technology applications.  Fluid power products include hydraulic and pneumatic technologies using liquids and gases  to transmit power, typically in smaller spaces than other forms of power transmission.  Hydraulic products offer high  power to weight ratios, high torque at low speeds, and power reliability, while pneumatic products are focused on  lightweight applications in need of speed and precision.  Our ﬂuid power products and solutions are commonly used  for off-highway equipment, heavy industrial equipment and machines at factories, marine and offshore equipment,  factory automation, food processing equipment, packaging operations, and downstream energy process systems.  Operations are supported by a team of certiﬁed ﬂuid power specialists, mechanics, technicians, and engineers that  provide technical services ranging from system design and integration, electronic control integration, hydraulic  assemblies, repair and rebuild, manifold design and assembly, customized ﬁltration solutions, software programming  and repair, and hydraulic system retroﬁts. Our specialty ﬂow control operations encompass the operations of our ﬁscal 2018 acquisition of FCX Performance,  Inc., which provides highly engineered process ﬂow control products, solutions, and services.  Products include  pumps, valves, ﬁttings, hoses, process instrumentation, actuators, and ﬁltration supplies which are used to control  the ﬂow of liquids and gases in mission-critical industrial applications.  Our ﬂow control products and services are  focused on MRO related applications; OEMs; and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) ﬁrms across a  variety of industries including chemicals, steel, power, oil and gas, pulp and paper, pharmaceuticals, food and  beverage, and general industrials.  Similar to our ﬂuid power operations, our ﬂow control offering includes technical  service capabilities such as ﬂow control systems integration, repair services, valve actuation, process instrumentation,  pipe and hose fabrication, and compliance consulting. machine performance, and reduce overall procurement and maintenance costs.  By providing high levels of service,  product and industry expertise, and technical support, while at the same time offering product breadth and  competitive pricing, we believe we develop stronger, longer-lasting, and more proﬁtable customer relationships.  See  the Reportable Segments section below for more detail on the various service solutions we provide to customers. REPORTABLE SEGMENTS We report results of operations in two segments: 1) Service Center Based Distribution, and 2) Fluid Power & Flow  Control.  In ﬁscal 2020, our Service Center Based Distribution segment represented 69% of our total sales, while our  Fluid Power & Flow Control segment represented 31% of our total sales.

Products primarily include industrial bearings,  motors, belting, drives, couplings, pumps, linear motion products, hydraulic and pneumatic components, ﬁltration  supplies, and hoses, as well as other related supplies for general operational needs of customers’ machinery and  equipment. Service center locations are stocked with product inventory tailored to each local market and staffed with customer  sales and service representatives, account managers, as well as product and industry specialists.  Customer sales and  service representatives receive, process, and expedite customer orders, provide product information, and assist  account managers in serving customers.  Account managers make onsite calls to customers to provide product  information, identify customer requirements, make recommendations, and assist in implementing equipment  maintenance and storeroom management programs.  Industry specialists assist with product applications in their  areas of expertise.  Service centers market product offerings with a suite of services that create additional value for  the customer.  This includes onsite training, product fabrication and repair, and inventory management solutions.   We also provide analysis and measurement of productivity improvement and cost savings potential from these  services through our Applied Documented Value-Added® (DVA®) reports. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. WORKING CAPITAL Our working capital position is discussed in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference. We require substantial working capital related to accounts receivable and inventories.  Signiﬁcant amounts of  inventory are carried to meet customers' delivery requirements.  We generally require payments for sales on account  within 30 days.  Returns are not considered to have a material effect on our working capital requirements.  We  believe these practices are generally consistent among companies in our industry. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS We believe that compliance with laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise  relating to environmental protection will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or  competitive position. Our robotic and machinery automation operations encompass our ﬁscal 2020 acquisition of Olympus Controls,  which provides solutions focused on the design, assembly, integration, and distribution of motion control, machine  vision, and robotic technologies for OEMs, machine builders, integrators, and other industrial and technology end  users.  Products and solutions are marketed across a variety of industries including technology, medical, life sciences,  logistics, and general industrial.  Olympus Controls helps customers develop, produce, and integrate machine  automation solutions using comprehensive technology and industry processes. BACKLOG AND SEASONALITY   Backlog orders are not material to our business as a whole, although they are a more important factor for our ﬂuid  power and ﬂow control businesses.  Our business has exhibited minor seasonality.  In particular, sales per day during  the ﬁrst half of our ﬁscal year have historically been slightly lower than the second half due, in part, to the impact of  customer plant shutdowns, summer vacations and holidays. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, AND LICENSES  Customer recognition of our service marks and trade names, including Applied Industrial Technologies®, Applied®,  and AIT®, is an important contributing factor to our sales.  Patents and licenses are not of material importance to  our business. RAW MATERIALS AND GENERAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS   Our operations are dependent on general industrial and economic conditions.  We would be adversely affected by  the unavailability of raw materials to our suppliers, prolonged labor disputes experienced by suppliers or customers,  or by events or conditions that have an adverse effect on industrial activity generally in the markets we serve or on  key customer industries. NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES   At June 30, 2020, we had approximately 6,200 employees. In addition to other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors that could  materially affect our business, ﬁnancial condition, or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only  risks facing the Company.  Certain risks are identiﬁed below in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  This information is incorporated here by reference.  Additional risks not currently known to us, risks that could apply broadly to issuers, or risks that we currently deem  immaterial, may also impact our business and operations.  Risks can also change over time. Our business depends heavily on the operating levels of our customers and the factors that affect them,  including general economic conditions.  The markets for our products and services are subject to conditions or  events that affect demand for goods and materials that our customers produce.  Consequently, demand for our  products and services has been and will continue to be inﬂuenced by most of the same factors that affect demand  for and production of customers' goods and materials. When customers or prospective customers reduce production levels because of lower demand, increased supply,  higher costs, tight credit conditions, unfavorable currency exchange rates, adverse trade policies, foreign  competition, other competitive disadvantage, offshoring of production, or other reasons, their need for our products  and services diminishes.  Selling prices and terms of sale come under pressure, adversely affecting the proﬁtability  and the durability of customer relationships, and credit losses may increase.  Inventory management becomes more  difﬁcult in times of economic uncertainty.  Volatile economic and credit conditions also make it more difﬁcult for us,  as well as our customers and suppliers, to forecast and plan future business activities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response thereto continue to impact  our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain  and cannot be predicted.  The COVID-19 pandemic has created signiﬁcant volatility, uncertainty, and economic  disruption.  The extent to which the pandemic continues to impact our results of operations and ﬁnancial condition  will depend on evolving factors that are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the following: the duration,  spread, and severity of the pandemic in the countries in which we operate; responsive measures taken by  governmental authorities, businesses, and individuals; the effect on our customers and their demand for our  products and services; the effect on our suppliers and disruptions to the global supply chain; our ability to sell and  provide our products and services and otherwise operate effectively, including as a result of travel restrictions and  associates working from home; disruptions to our operations resulting from associate illness; restrictions or  disruptions to, or reduced availability of, transportation; customers’ ability to pay for our services and products;  closures of our facilities or those of our customers or suppliers; the impact of reduced customer demand on  purchasing incentives we earn from suppliers; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating  conditions can resume.  The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted and will result in lost or delayed sales  to us, and we have experienced business disruptions as we have modiﬁed our business practices (including travel,  work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings).  In addition, the pandemic’s impact on the  economy may affect the proper functioning of ﬁnancial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates,  product and energy costs, and interest rates.  Even after the pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience  adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has occurred or may occur  in the future.  The pandemic’s effects may also amplify the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual  Report on Form 10-K, and may continue to materially and adversely affect our business, ﬁnancial condition, results of  operations, and/or stock price. Our business could be adversely affected if we do not successfully execute our strategies to grow sales and  earnings.  We have numerous strategies and initiatives to grow sales, leveraging the breadth of our product  offering, supplier relationships, and value-added technical capabilities to differentiate us and improve our  competitive position.  We also continually seek to enhance gross margins, manage costs, and otherwise improve  earnings.  Many of our activities target improvements to the consistency of our operating practices across our  hundreds of locations. If we do not implement these initiatives effectively, or if for other reasons they are  unsuccessful, our business could be adversely affected. Consolidation in our customers' and suppliers' industries could adversely affect our business and ﬁnancial  results.  Consolidation continues among our product suppliers and customers.  As customer industries consolidate or  customers otherwise aggregate their purchasing power, a greater proportion of our sales could be derived from  large volume contracts, which could adversely impact margins.  Consolidation among customers can trigger changes  in their purchasing strategies, potentially shifting blocks of business among competing distributors and contributing  to volatility in our sales and pressure on prices.  Similarly, continued consolidation among our suppliers could reduce  our ability to negotiate favorable pricing and other commercial terms for our inventory purchases.  There can be no  assurance we will be able to take advantage of consolidation trends. Loss of key supplier authorizations, lack of product availability, or changes in distribution programs could  adversely affect our sales and earnings.  Our business depends on maintaining an immediately available supply of  various products to meet customer demand.  Many of our relationships with key product suppliers are longstanding,  but are terminable by either party.  The loss of key supplier authorizations, or a substantial decrease in the availability  of their products, could put us at a competitive disadvantage and have a material adverse effect on our business.  Supply interruptions could arise from raw materials shortages, inadequate manufacturing capacity or utilization to  meet demand, ﬁnancial problems or insolvency, trade issues, labor disputes, public health emergencies, weather  conditions affecting suppliers' production, transportation disruptions, or other reasons beyond our control. In addition, as a distributor, we face the risk of key product suppliers changing their relationships with distributors  generally, or us in particular, in a manner that adversely impacts us. For example, key suppliers could change the  following: the prices we must pay for their products relative to other distributors or relative to competing brands; the  geographic or product line breadth of distributor authorizations; supplier purchasing incentive or other support  programs; product purchase or stocking expectations; or the extent to which the suppliers seek to serve end users  directly. An increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings.  We operate in a highly competitive industry.  The  industry remains fragmented, but is consolidating.  Our principal competitors are specialist and general line  distributors of bearings, power transmission products, ﬂuid power components and systems, ﬂow control solutions,  automation technologies, industrial rubber products, linear motion components, tools, safety products, oilﬁeld  supplies, and other industrial and maintenance supplies.  These competitors include local, regional, national, and multinational operations, and can include catalog and e-commerce companies.  Competition is largely focused in the  local service area and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities, and price.  Existing competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater ﬁnancial or other resources than we do,  broader or more appealing product or service offerings, greater market presence, stronger relationships with key  suppliers or customers, or better name recognition.  If existing or future competitors seek to gain or to retain market  share by aggressive pricing strategies and sales methods, or otherwise through competitive advantage, our sales and  proﬁtability could be adversely affected.  Our success will also be affected by our ability to continue to provide  competitive offerings as customer preferences or demands evolve, for example with respect to our product and  services portfolio or our e-commerce and inventory management solutions.  Technological evolution or other factors  can render product offerings obsolete, potentially impairing our competitive position and our inventory values. The purchasing incentives we earn from product suppliers can be impacted if we reduce our purchases in  response to declining customer demand.  Certain product suppliers have historically offered to their distributors,  including us, incentives for purchasing their products.  In addition to market or customer account-speciﬁc incentives,  certain suppliers pay incentives to the distributor for attaining speciﬁc purchase volumes during a program period.  In  some cases, to earn incentives, we must achieve year-over-year growth in purchases with the supplier.  When  demand for our products declines, we may be less inclined to add inventory to take advantage of certain incentive  programs, thereby potentially adversely impacting our proﬁtability. Trade policies can have an adverse impact on industries we sell into, potentially negatively affecting our  net sales and proﬁts.  Changes to trade policies or agreements, including the recently enacted United States- Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), can disrupt geographic and industry demand trends.  While Applied primarily  serves markets in the United States, a signiﬁcant portion of our domestic customer base exports or serves exporters.  U.S. government-imposed tariffs or taxes that penalize imports can be met with countermeasures by foreign  governments, or can otherwise impact industrial production, and it becomes difﬁcult to determine what the net  effect of such actions is on Applied’s net sales and proﬁts.  It is possible that such changes could adversely affect our  ﬁnancial results. Volatility in product, energy, and other costs can affect our proﬁtability.  Product manufacturers may adjust  the prices of products we distribute for many reasons, including changes in their costs for raw materials,  components, energy, labor, and tariffs and taxes on imports. In addition, a portion of our own distribution costs is  composed of fuel for our sales and delivery vehicles, freight, and utility expenses for our facilities.  Our ability to pass  along increases in our product and distribution costs in a timely manner to our customers depends on execution,  market conditions, and contractual limitations.  Failing to pass along price increases timely in an inﬂationary  environment, or not maintaining sales volume while increasing prices, could signiﬁcantly reduce our proﬁtability. While increases in the cost of products or energy could be damaging to us, decreases in those costs, particularly if  severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deﬂation in selling prices, which could cause our gross proﬁt  margin to deteriorate.  Changes in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect customers; for example,  declines in oil, gas, and coal prices may negatively impact customers operating in those industries and, consequently,  our sales to those customers. Changes in customer or product mix and downward pressure on sales prices could cause our gross proﬁt  percentage to ﬂuctuate or decline.  Because we serve thousands of customers in many end markets, and offer  millions of products, with varying proﬁtability levels, changes in our customer or product mix could cause our gross  proﬁt percentage to ﬂuctuate or decline.  Downward pressure on sales prices could also cause our gross proﬁt  percentage to ﬂuctuate or decline.  We can experience downward pressure on sales prices as a result of deﬂation,  pressure from customers to reduce costs, or increased competition. Our ability to transact business is highly reliant on information systems.  A disruption or security breach  could materially affect our business, ﬁnancial condition, or results of operation.  We depend on information  systems to, among other things, process customer orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections,  purchase products, manage accounts payable processes, ship products to customers on a timely basis, maintain cost- effective operations, provide superior service to customers, conduct business communications, and compile ﬁnancial  results.  A serious, prolonged disruption of our information systems, due to man-made or natural causes, including  power or telecommunications outage, or breach in security, could materially impair fundamental business processes  and increase expenses, decrease sales, or otherwise reduce earnings. Because of our reliance on information systems, we are vulnerable to the growing threat of damage or intrusion  from computer viruses or other cyber-attacks, including ransomware and business e-mail compromise, on our  systems.  Despite precautions taken to prevent or mitigate the risks of such incidents, breaches of our systems could  not only cause business disruption, but could also result in the theft of funds, the theft, loss, or disclosure of proprietary or conﬁdential information, or the breach of customer, supplier, or employee information.  A security  incident involving our systems, or even an inadvertent failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and  regulations, could negatively impact our sales, damage our reputation, and cause us to incur unanticipated legal  liability, remediation costs, and other losses and expenses. In recent years, we replaced multiple legacy information system applications with newer software platforms, to  enhance our business information and transaction systems to support future growth.  We continue with and  consider additional enterprise resource planning system conversions, on a smaller scale, in discrete business  operations.  Despite extensive planning, we could experience disruptions related to the implementation because of  the projects' complexity.  The potential adverse consequences could include delays, loss of information, diminished  management reporting capabilities, damage to our ability to process transactions timely, harm to our control  environment, diminished employee productivity, and unanticipated increases in costs.  Further, our ability to achieve  anticipated operational beneﬁts from new platforms is not assured. Acquisitions are a key component of our anticipated growth.  We may not be able to identify or to  complete future acquisitions, to integrate them effectively into our operations, or to realize their  anticipated beneﬁts.  Many industries we serve are mature.  As a result, acquisitions of businesses have been  important to our growth.  While we wish to continue to acquire businesses, we may not be able to identify and to  negotiate suitable acquisitions, to obtain ﬁnancing for them on satisfactory terms, or otherwise to complete  acquisitions.  In addition, existing and future competitors, and private equity ﬁrms, increasingly compete with us for  acquisitions, which can increase prices and reduce the number of suitable opportunities; the acquisitions they make  can also adversely impact our market position. We seek acquisition opportunities that complement and expand our operations.  However, substantial costs, delays,  or other difﬁculties related to integrating acquisitions could adversely affect our business or ﬁnancial results.  For  example, we could face signiﬁcant challenges in consolidating functions, integrating information systems, personnel,  and operations, and implementing procedures and controls in a timely and efﬁcient manner. Further, even if we successfully integrate the acquisitions with our operations, we may not be able to realize cost  savings, sales, proﬁt levels, or other beneﬁts that we anticipate from these acquisitions, either as to amount or in the  time frame we expect.  Our ability to realize anticipated beneﬁts may be affected by a number of factors, including  the following: our ability to achieve planned operating results, to reduce duplicative expenses and inventory  effectively, and to consolidate facilities; economic and market factors; the incurrence of signiﬁcant integration costs  or charges in order to achieve those beneﬁts; our ability to retain key product supplier authorizations, customer  relationships, and employees; our ability to address competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges arising from  entering into new markets (geographic, product, service, end-industry, or otherwise), especially those in which we  may have limited or no direct experience; and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired  company.  In addition, acquisitions could place signiﬁcant demand on administrative, operational, and ﬁnancial  resources. We incurred a substantial amount of debt in 2018 to complete the acquisition of FCX Performance, Inc. ("FCX"), a  distributor of specialty process ﬂow control products and services.  The aggregate purchase price of FCX was $781.8  million.  To service our debt, we require a signiﬁcant amount of cash that may limit our ability to pay dividends,  repurchase our shares, or complete other acquisitions or strategic initiatives.  In connection with the FCX acquisition,  we entered into a new credit facility pursuant to which we incurred approximately $780.0 million in term loan  indebtedness and approximately $250.0 million in revolving indebtedness capacity.  This indebtedness substantially  increased our leverage and requires signiﬁcant future principal and interest payments.  As of June 30, 2020, we had  total debt obligations outstanding of $935.3 million.  Our ability to service our debt and fund our other liquidity  needs will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  The additional leverage may (i) require us to  dedicate a substantial portion of our cash ﬂows from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the  availability of our cash ﬂow to fund planned capital expenditures, pay dividends, repurchase our shares, complete  other acquisitions or strategic initiatives, and other general corporate purposes; (ii) limit our ability to obtain  additional ﬁnancing in the future (either at all or on satisfactory terms) to enable us to react to changes in our  business or execute our growth strategies; and (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in  our industry that have lower levels of indebtedness.  Additionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the  instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default.  Any of the foregoing events or circumstances  relating to our additional indebtedness may adversely affect our business, ﬁnancial position, or results of operations  and may cause our stock price to decline. Goodwill, long-lived, and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become  impaired.  We review goodwill, long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identiﬁable  amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the Our ability to maintain effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may be insufﬁcient to allow us to  accurately report our ﬁnancial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our ﬁnancial statements to  become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.  We require  effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our  ﬁnancial reports and to effectively prevent fraud.  Internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect  misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or  overriding of controls, or fraud.  Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance  with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of ﬁnancial statements.  If we cannot provide reasonable  assurance with respect to our ﬁnancial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our ﬁnancial statements could be  materially misstated, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, including any failure to  implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difﬁculties in their implementation, our business,  ﬁnancial condition and operating results could be harmed.  Any material weakness could affect investor conﬁdence  in the accuracy and completeness of our ﬁnancial statements.  As a result, our ability to obtain any additional  ﬁnancing, or additional ﬁnancing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected.  This, in turn, could  materially and adversely affect our business, ﬁnancial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to  incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  In addition, perceptions of the  Company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely  affected. We cannot assure that any material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and  maintain adequate internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.  In addition, although we have been successful  historically in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to  prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair presentation of our ﬁnancial statements included in our periodic  reports ﬁled with the SEC. Our business depends on our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain qualiﬁed employees.  Our  success depends on hiring, developing, motivating, and retaining key employees, including executive, managerial,  sales, professional, and other personnel.  We may have difﬁculty identifying and hiring qualiﬁed personnel.  In  addition, we may have difﬁculty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against  us.  With respect to sales and customer service positions in particular, we greatly beneﬁt from having employees who  are familiar with the products and services we sell, and their applications, as well as with our customer and supplier  relationships.  The loss of key employees or our failure to attract and retain other qualiﬁed workers could disrupt or  adversely affect our business.  In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased competition carrying amounts are not recoverable.  Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include  signiﬁcant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, signiﬁcant  underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, or a likely sale or disposal of the asset  before the end of its estimated useful life.  In 2020, we recorded a $131.0 million non-cash impairment charge for  goodwill associated with the FCX business. As of June 30, 2020, we had $540.6 million of goodwill and $343.2 million of other intangible assets, net.  We  assess all existing goodwill at least annually for impairment on a reporting unit basis.  The techniques used in our  qualitative assessment and goodwill impairment tests incorporate a number of estimates and assumptions that are  subject to change.  Although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reﬂect market  conditions forecasted at the assessment date, any changes to these assumptions and estimates due to market  conditions or otherwise may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods. Tight credit markets could impact our ability to obtain ﬁnancing on reasonable terms or increase the cost  of future ﬁnancing.  Although the credit market turmoil of a decade ago did not have a signiﬁcant adverse impact  on our liquidity or borrowing costs, the availability of funds tightened and credit spreads on corporate debt  increased.  If credit market volatility were to return, obtaining additional or replacement ﬁnancing could be more  difﬁcult and the cost of issuing new debt or replacing a credit facility could be higher than under our current  facilities.  Tight credit conditions could limit our ability to ﬁnance acquisitions on terms acceptable to us. For more information regarding borrowing and interest rates, see the following sections below: “Liquidity and  Capital Resources” in Item 7 under the caption “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and  Results of Operations;” Item 7A under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk;” and  notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, included below in Item 8 under the caption “Financial  Statements and Supplementary Data.”  That information is incorporated here by reference. We may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices or the method by which LIBOR is  determined.  As of June 30, 2020, we had approximately $764.3 million of aggregate consolidated indebtedness  that was indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”).  In addition, as of June 30, 2020, approximately  $431.0 million of this variable rate debt was converted to a ﬁxed rate through an interest rate swap.  The swap  agreement was entered into in January 2019 and is indexed to LIBOR.  Central banks around the world, including  the Federal Reserve, have commissioned working groups of market participants and ofﬁcial sector representatives  with the goal of ﬁnding suitable replacements for LIBOR based on observable market transactions.  It is expected that  a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next few  years.  The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that it has commitments  from panel banks to continue to contribute to LIBOR through the end of 2021, but that it will not use its powers to  compel contributions beyond such date.  Accordingly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the publication of  such rates beyond 2021.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York and various other authorities have commenced the  publication of reforms and actions relating to alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR.  Although the full impact of such  reforms and actions, together with any transition away from LIBOR, including the potential or actual discontinuance  of LIBOR publication, remains unclear, these changes may have a material adverse impact on the availability of  ﬁnancing, including LIBOR-based loans, and on our ﬁnancing costs. We are subject to litigation and regulatory risk due to the nature of our business, which may have a  material adverse effect on our business.  From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits or other legal  proceedings that arise from our business.  These may, for example, relate to product liability claims, commercial  disputes, personal injuries, or employment-related matters.  In addition, we could face claims over other matters,  such as claims arising from our status as a public company or government contractor, our engagement in  international trade, or otherwise relating to our compliance with a wide array of laws and regulations to which we  are subject.  Our contracts with federal, state, and local governments subject us to various laws and regulations  governing these contracts, increased costs of compliance, and the potential for government audits.  The defense and  ultimate outcome of lawsuits or other legal proceedings or inquiries may result in higher operating expenses, the  inability to participate in existing or future government contacts, or other adverse consequences, which could have a  material adverse effect on our business, ﬁnancial condition, or results of operations. for employees, shortages of qualiﬁed workers, higher employee turnover (including through retirement as the  workforce ages), or increased employee compensation or beneﬁt costs. An interruption of operations at our headquarters or distribution centers, or in our means of transporting  product, could adversely impact our business.  Our business depends on maintaining operating activity at our  headquarters and distribution centers, and being able to receive and deliver product in a timely manner.  A serious,  prolonged interruption due to power or telecommunications outage, security incident, terrorist attack, public health  emergency, earthquake, extreme weather events, other natural disasters, ﬁre, ﬂood, transportation disruption, or  other interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and ﬁnancial results. There is no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.  The timing, declaration,  amount, and payment of dividends to our shareholders fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and  depend on many factors, including our ﬁnancial condition and results of operations, as well as applicable law and  business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.  There can be no assurance that we will  continue to pay a quarterly dividend. Additionally, if we cannot generate sufﬁcient cash ﬂow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then  our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the Board of Directors, will be impaired and we may be required to  attempt to restructure or reﬁnance our debt, raise additional capital, or take other actions such as selling assets,  reducing, or delaying capital expenditures, or reducing our dividend.  There can be no assurance, however, that any  such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our  other credit and contractual arrangements. Our operations outside the United States increase our exposure to global economic and political conditions  and currency exchange volatility.  Foreign operations contributed 13% of our sales in 2020.  This presence  outside the U.S. increases risks associated with exposure to more volatile economic conditions, political instability,  cultural and legal differences in conducting business (including corrupt practices), economic and trade policy actions,  and currency exchange ﬂuctuations. Our foreign operations' results are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at applicable  exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated ﬁnancial statements.  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect  our operating results and ﬁnancial position, as well as the comparability of results between ﬁnancial periods. Our business is subject to risks, some for which we maintain third-party insurance and some for which we  self-insure.  We may incur losses and be subject to liability claims that could have a material adverse effect  on our ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, or cash ﬂows.  We maintain insurance policies that provide  limited coverage for some, but not all, of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business.  The policies  are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insured basis.  For  some risks, we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks  presented.  Because of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase  substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced  amounts of coverage.  As a result, we may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or procure other desirable  insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.  Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest  their obligations to make payments.  Our ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, and cash ﬂows could be  materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured events, as well as by delays  in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments. • changes in accounting policies and practices that could impact our ﬁnancial reporting and increase compliance  costs. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS. We believe having a local presence is important to serving our customers, so we maintain service centers and other  operations in local markets throughout the countries in which we operate.  At June 30, 2020, we owned real  properties at 117 locations and leased 433 locations.  Certain properties house more than one operation. The properties in Baldwinsville, Newark, Midland, and Stafford are used in our Fluid Power & Flow Control segment.  The Fontana and Longview properties are used in both the Service Center Based Distribution segment and the Fluid  Power & Flow Control segment.  The remaining properties are used in the Service Center Based Distribution  segment. We consider our properties generally sufﬁcient to meet our requirements for ofﬁce space and inventory stocking. A service center's size is primarily inﬂuenced by the amount and types of inventory the service center requires to  meet customers' needs. When opening new operations, we have tended to lease rather than purchase real property.  We do not consider  any service center, distribution center, or shop property to be material, because we believe that, if it becomes  necessary or desirable to relocate an operation, other suitable property could be found. In addition to operating locations, we own or lease certain properties which in the aggregate are not material and  are either for sale, lease, or sublease to third parties due to a relocation or closing.  We also may lease or sublease to  others unused portions of buildings. Not applicable. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. ITEM 4.  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT. Applied and/or one of its subsidiaries is a party to pending legal proceedings with respect to product liability,  commercial, personal injury, employment, and other matters.  Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of  these proceedings or the range of reasonably possible loss, we do not expect, based on circumstances currently  known, that the ultimate resolution of any of these proceedings will have, either individually or in the aggregate, a  material adverse effect on Applied's consolidated ﬁnancial position, results of operations, or cash ﬂows. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of SEC Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95  to this annual report on Form 10-K. Applied's executive ofﬁcers are elected by the Board of Directors for a term of one year, or until their successors are  chosen and qualiﬁed, at the Board's organization meeting held following the annual meeting of shareholders. The following is a list of the executive ofﬁcers and a description of their business experience during the past ﬁve  years.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION During the current ﬁscal year, the COVID-19 pandemic signiﬁcantly impacted the business.  We are classiﬁed as  critical infrastructure and our facilities remain open and operational as they adhere to health and safety policies.   Demand was challenging in the second half of the ﬁscal year as customers in many of our core manufacturing end  markets idled or reduced production capacity and facility utilization in response to the pandemic.  Underlying trends  remain subdued but are exhibiting stability into our ﬁscal 2021 ﬁrst quarter with organic sales down mid-teens year- over-year through early August.  We are continuing to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continue  to take appropriate cost actions.  Cost measures implemented to date include reduced discretionary spend, staff  realignments, temporary furloughs and pay reductions, suspension of 401(k) company match, and other expense  reduction actions. Our earnings per share was $0.62 in ﬁscal 2020 versus $3.68 in ﬁscal year 2019. Our ﬁscal 2020 consolidated sales were $3.2 billion, a decrease of $227.0 million or 6.5% compared to the prior  year, with the acquisitions of Fluid Power Sales Inc. (FPS), MilRoc Distribution (MilRoc), Woodward Steel (Woodward)  and Olympus Controls (Olympus) increasing sales by $80.7 million or 2.3% and unfavorable foreign currency  translation of $10.5 million decreasing sales by 0.3%.  Gross proﬁt margin decreased to 28.9% for ﬁscal 2020 from  29.0% for ﬁscal 2019.  The gross margin was negatively affected by 12 basis points for $3.9 million of non-routine  expense recorded in cost of sales related to inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory for certain locations  that were closed during the year within the U.S. operations of the Service Center Based Distribution segment.  Operating margin decreased to 2.7% in ﬁscal 2020 from 6.7% in ﬁscal 2019.  The reduction in operating margin is  primarily due to a $131.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded during ﬁscal 2020 related to the  goodwill associated with the Company's FCX Performance, Inc. (FCX) operations within the Fluid Power & Flow  Control segment.  The prior ﬁscal year included a $31.6 million non-cash intangible impairment charge related to the  long-lived intangible assets associated with the Company's Canadian operations within the Service Center Based  Distribution segment.  The non-cash impairment charges decreased net income by $118.8 million and earnings per  share by $3.04 per share for ﬁscal 2020 and decreased net income by $23.1 million and earnings per share by $0.59  per share for ﬁscal 2019. During ﬁscal 2020, the Company recorded non-routine expense of $9.0 million related to consolidating locations  and reducing headcount primarily within the Company's U.S. operations of the Service Center Based Distribution  segment.  Of the total, $3.9 million related to inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory for certain  locations that were closed during the year recorded within cost of sales, and $5.1 million related to severance and  facility consolidation recorded within selling, distribution and administrative expense.  Also, the Company recorded a  $1.0 million tax beneﬁt related to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act within income tax  expense.  Total non-routine charges reduced gross proﬁt by $3.9 million, decreased operating income by $9.0  million, and decreased net income by $5.8 million for ﬁscal 2020. With more than 6,200 employees across North America, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, Applied Industrial  Technologies (“Applied,” the “Company,” “We,” “Us” or “Our”) is a leading value-added distributor and technical  solutions provider of industrial motion, ﬂuid power, ﬂow control, automation technologies, and related maintenance  supplies.  Our leading brands, specialized services, and comprehensive knowledge serve MRO (Maintenance, Repair  & Operations) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) end users in virtually all industrial markets through our  multi-channel capabilities that provide choice, convenience, and expertise.  We have a long tradition of growth  dating back to 1923, the year our business was founded in Cleveland, Ohio.  At June 30, 2020, business was  conducted in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore from  approximately 580 facilities. The following is Management's Discussion and Analysis of signiﬁcant factors that have affected our ﬁnancial  condition, results of operations and cash ﬂows during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated  balance sheets, statements of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income and consolidated cash  ﬂows in Item 8 under the caption "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  When reviewing the discussion  and analysis set forth below, please note that a signiﬁcant number of SKUs (Stock Keeping Units) we sell in any given  year were not sold in the comparable period of the prior year, resulting in the inability to quantify certain commonly  used comparative metrics analyzing sales, such as changes in product mix and volume. AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Sales in ﬁscal 2020 were $3.2 billion, which was $227.0 million or 6.5% below the prior year, with sales from  acquisitions adding $80.7 million or 2.3% and unfavorable foreign currency translation accounting for a decrease of  $10.5 million or 0.3%.  There were 253.5 selling days in ﬁscal 2020 and 251.5 selling days in ﬁscal 2019.  Excluding  the impact of businesses acquired and foreign currency translation, sales were down $297.2 million or 8.5% during  the year, driven by a 9.4% decrease from operations due to weak demand across key end markets, further impacted  by the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, offset by an increase of 0.9% due to two  additional sales days. Shareholders’ equity was $843.5 million at June 30, 2020 compared to $897.0 million at June 30, 2019.  Working  capital increased $9.3 million from June 30, 2019 to $733.7 million at June 30, 2020.  The current ratio was 2.7 to 1  at June 30, 2020 and at June 30, 2019. Applied monitors several economic indices that have been key indicators for industrial economic activity in the United  States.  These include the Industrial Production (IP) and Manufacturing Capacity Utilization (MCU) indices published  by the Federal Reserve Board and the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) published by the Institute for Supply  Management (ISM).  Historically, our performance correlates well with the MCU, which measures productivity and  calculates a ratio of actual manufacturing output versus potential full capacity output.  When manufacturing plants  are running at a high rate of capacity, they tend to wear out machinery and require replacement parts. The MCU (total industry) and IP indices decreased during the second half of ﬁscal 2020 correlating with an overall  decline in the industrial economy in the same period.  The ISM PMI registered 52.6 in June 2020, an increase from  the June 2019 revised reading of 51.6.  A reading above 50 generally indicates expansion.  The index readings for  the months during the current quarter, along with the revised indices for previous quarter ends, were as follows: This discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements for  the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.  For the comparison of the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, see the  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our 2019  Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table is included to aid in review of Applied’s statements of consolidated income.  Month MCU PMI IP December 2019 77.2 47.8 105.1 September 2019 77.4 48.2 104.5 June 2019 77.7 51.6 105.0 March 2020 73.5 49.1 99.6 April 2020 64.2 41.5 83.8 May 2020 65.1 43.1 87.0 June 2020 68.6 52.6 93.3 Net Sales 100.0% 100.0% (6.5)% Gross Profit Margin 28.9% 29.0% (6.9)% Selling, Distribution & Administrative 22.1% 21.4% (3.3)% Net Income 0.7% 4.1% (83.3)% Operating Income 2.7% 6.7% (61.9)% The following table shows changes in sales by reportable segment. Sales of our Service Center Based Distribution segment, which operates primarily in MRO markets, decreased $210.9  million, or 8.6%.  Acquisitions within this segment increased sales by $23.8 million or 1.0%, and unfavorable  foreign currency translation decreased sales by $10.5 million or 0.4%.  Excluding the impact of businesses acquired  and the impact of foreign currency translation, sales decreased $224.2 million or 9.2% during the year, driven by a  10.0% decrease from operations due to weak demand across key end markets, offset by an increase of 0.8% due to  two additional sales days. Sales of our Fluid Power & Flow Control segment decreased $16.1 million or 1.6%.  Acquisitions within this  segment, primarily Olympus, increased sales $56.9 million or 5.6%.  Excluding the impact of businesses acquired,  sales decreased $73.0 million or 7.2%, driven by a 8.0% decrease from operations, offset by an 0.8% increase due  to two additional sales days.  The decrease from operations is primarily due to slower demand in our ﬂow control  operations and weaker activity across our industrial OEM customer base. The following table shows changes in sales by geographical area.  Other countries includes Mexico, Australia, New  Zealand, and Singapore. Sales in our U.S. operations decreased $197.3 million or 6.5%, with acquisitions adding $80.7 million or 2.7%.  Excluding the impact of businesses acquired, U.S. sales were down $278.0 million or 9.2%, driven by a decrease of  10.0% from operations, offset by an increase of 0.8% due to two additional sales days.  Sales from our Canadian  operations decreased $22.7 million or 8.4%, and unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased Canadian sales  by $2.7 million or 1.0%.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, Canadian sales were down $20.0  million or 7.4%, driven by a decrease of 8.2% from operations, offset by an increase of 0.8% due to two additional  sales days.  Consolidated sales from our other country operations decreased $7.0 million or 3.8% compared to the  prior year.  Unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased other country sales by $7.8 million or 4.2%.   Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, other country sales were up $0.8 million or 0.4% compared to  the prior year, driven by an increase of 1.2% due to additional sales days, offset by a 0.8% decrease from  operations. Our gross proﬁt margin decreased to 28.9% in ﬁscal 2020 compared to 29.0% in ﬁscal 2019.  The gross margin was  negatively affected by 12 basis points for $3.9 million of non-routine expense recorded within cost of sales related to  inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory for certain locations that were closed during the year within the  U.S. operations of the Service Center Based Distribution segment.

SD&A  decreased $24.5 million or 3.3% during ﬁscal 2020 compared to the prior year, and as a percentage of sales  increased to 22.1% in ﬁscal 2020 compared to 21.4% in ﬁscal 2019.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates  had the effect of decreasing SD&A by $2.5 million or 0.3% compared to the prior year.  SD&A from businesses  acquired added $20.8 million or 2.8%, including $1.9 million of intangibles amortization related to acquisitions.   Excluding the impact of businesses acquired and the favorable impact from foreign currency translation, SD&A  decreased $42.8 million or 5.8% during ﬁscal 2020 compared to ﬁscal 2019.  The Company incurred $5.1 million of  non-routine expenses related to severance and facility consolidation primarily within the U.S. Operations of the  Service Center Based Distribution segment during ﬁscal 2020, compared to $1.6 million of restructuring expenses  incurred in ﬁscal 2019.  Excluding the impact of acquisitions, total compensation excluding severance decreased  $39.8 million during ﬁscal 2020, primarily due to cost reduction actions taken by the Company in response to the  COVID-19 pandemic, including headcount reductions, temporary furloughs and pay reductions, and suspension of  the 401(k) company match.  All other expenses within SD&A were down $6.5 million. During the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test.  As a result  of this test, the Company recorded a $131.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Company's  FCX operations in the Fluid Power & Flow Control segment, primarily due to the overall decline in the industrial  economy, speciﬁcally slower demand in FCX's end markets.  The non-cash goodwill impairment charge decreased  net income by $118.8 million and earnings per share by $3.04 per share for ﬁscal 2020.  In ﬁscal 2019, the  Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $31.6 million for intangible assets related to the Company's  Canadian operations within the Service Center Based Distribution segment, which decreased net income by $23.1  million and earnings per share by $0.59 per share for ﬁscal 2019. Operating income decreased $144.8 million, or 61.9%, to $89.0 million during ﬁscal 2020 from $233.8 million  during ﬁscal 2019, and as a percentage of sales, decreased to 2.7% from 6.7%, primarily as a result of the goodwill  impairment expense recorded during the current year. Other income, net, represents certain non-operating items of income and expense, and was $2.8 million of income  in ﬁscal 2020 compared to $0.9 million of income in ﬁscal 2019.  Current year income primarily consists of  unrealized gains on investments held by non-qualiﬁed deferred compensation trusts of $0.5 million and foreign  currency transaction gains of $2.5 million, offset by other expense of $0.2 million.  Fiscal 2019 income consisted  primarily of unrealized gains on investments held by non-qualiﬁed deferred compensation trusts of $0.7 million and  life insurance income of $0.5 million, offset by foreign currency transaction losses of $0.3 million. Operating income, before intangible impairment charges, as a percentage of sales for the Service Center Based  Distribution segment decreased to 9.4% in ﬁscal 2020 from 10.4% in ﬁscal 2019.  Operating income, before  goodwill impairment charges, as a percentage of sales for the Fluid Power & Flow Control segment decreased to  10.9% in ﬁscal 2020 from 11.0% in ﬁscal 2019. Segment operating income is impacted by changes in the amounts and levels of certain supplier support beneﬁts  and expenses allocated to the segments.  The expense allocations include corporate charges for working capital,  logistics support and other items and impact segment gross proﬁt and operating expense. The effective income tax rate was 56.5% for ﬁscal 2020 compared to 26.0% for ﬁscal 2019.  The increase in the  effective tax rate is primarily due to the FCX goodwill impairment charge, which increased the effective tax rate by  31.4% during ﬁscal 2020.  The Company also recorded a $1.0 million tax beneﬁt related to the CARES Act during  the current year, which favorably impacted the rate by 1.8% in ﬁscal 2020. We expect our income tax rate for ﬁscal 2021 to be in the range of 23.0% to 25.0%. As a result of the factors discussed above, net income for ﬁscal 2020 decreased $120.0 million from the prior year.   Net income per share was $0.62 per share for ﬁscal 2020 compared to $3.68 per share for ﬁscal 2019.  Current year The following table shows the changes in selling, distribution, and administrative expense (SD&A). Amounts in millions Amount of change due to Year ended June 30, SD&A Decrease Acquisitions Foreign Currency Organic Change 2020 2019 SD&A $ 717.7 $ 742.2 $ (24.5) $ 20.8 $ (2.5) $ (42.8) results were negatively impacted by $3.04 per share for the goodwill impairment and $0.18 per share for non- routine expenses, offset by a favorable impact of $0.03 per share for the CARES Act tax beneﬁt.  The prior year  results included positive impacts on earnings per share of $0.48 per share for acquisitions, $0.37 per share for tax  reform, offset by a $0.69 per share unfavorable impact from the intangible impairment, which includes the impact of  recording the $3.8 million valuation allowance in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2019, and a $0.04 per share unfavorable  impact from restructuring charges during ﬁscal 2019. At June 30, 2020, we had a total of 580 operating facilities in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico,   Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, versus 600 at June 30, 2019. The approximate number of Company employees was 6,200 at June 30, 2020 and 6,650 at June 30, 2019. Our primary source of capital is cash ﬂow from operations, supplemented as necessary by bank borrowings or other  sources of debt.  At June 30, 2020 we had total debt obligations outstanding of $935.3 million compared to $959.8  million at June 30, 2019.  Management expects that our existing cash, cash equivalents, funds available under the  revolving credit facility, and cash provided from operations, will be sufﬁcient to ﬁnance normal working capital needs  in each of the countries we operate in, payment of dividends, acquisitions, investments in properties, facilities and  equipment, debt service, and the purchase of additional Company common stock.  Management also believes that  additional long-term debt and line of credit ﬁnancing could be obtained based on the Company’s credit standing  and ﬁnancial strength. The Company’s working capital at June 30, 2020 was $733.7 million compared to $724.3 million at June 30, 2019.   The current ratio was 2.7 to 1 at both June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019.  The following table is included to aid in review of Applied’s statements of consolidated cash ﬂows; all amounts   are in thousands. Net cash used in investing activities in ﬁscal 2020 included $37.2 million used for the acquisition of Olympus and  $20.1 million used for capital expenditures.  Net cash used in investing activities in ﬁscal 2019 included $37.5 million  used for the acquisitions of FPS, MilRoc and Woodward, and $19.0 million for capital expenditures. Net cash used in ﬁnancing activities included $49.6 million and $161.7 million of long-term debt repayments in 2020  and 2019, respectively, offset by $25.0 million of cash borrowings under a unsecured shelf facility agreement with  Prudential Investment Management in 2020 and $175.0 million of cash borrowings from the trade receivable  securitization facility in 2019.  Further uses of cash in 2020 were $48.9 million for dividend payments, $2.6 million  used to pay taxes for shares withheld, and $2.4 million used for acquisition holdback payments.  Further uses of cash  in 2019 were $47.3 million for dividend payments, $11.2 million used to repurchase 192,082 shares of treasury  stock, $3.5 million used to pay taxes for shares withheld, and $2.6 million used for acquisition holdback payments. The increase in dividends over the year is the result of regular increases in our dividend payout rates.  We paid  dividends of $1.26 and $1.22 per share in ﬁscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. At June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, the Company had borrowings outstanding under its unsecured shelf facility  agreement with Prudential Investment Management of $170.0 million.  Fees on this facility range from 0.25% to  1.25% per year based on the Company's leverage ratio at each quarter end.  The "Series C" notes have a principal  amount of $120.0 million, carry a ﬁxed interest rate of 3.19%, and are due in equal principal payments in July 2020,  2021, and 2022.  A $40.0 million principal payment was made on the "Series C" notes in July 2020.  The "Series D"  notes have a principal amount of $50.0 million and carry a ﬁxed interest rate of 3.21%.  A $25.0 million principal  payment was made on the "Series D" notes during ﬁscal 2020, and the remaining principal balance of $25.0 million In January 2018, the Company reﬁnanced its existing credit facility and entered into a new ﬁve-year credit facility  with a group of banks expiring in January 2023.  This agreement provides for a $780.0 million unsecured term loan  and a $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility.  Fees on this facility range from 0.10% to 0.20% per year  based upon the Company's leverage ratio at each quarter end.  Borrowings under this agreement carry variable  interest rates tied to either LIBOR or prime at the Company's discretion.  The Company had no amount outstanding  under the revolver as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019.  Unused lines under this facility, net of outstanding  letters of credit of $1.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively, to secure certain insurance obligations, totaled $248.1  million and $246.8 million at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and were available to fund future  acquisitions or other capital and operating requirements.  The interest rate on the term loan was 1.94% and 4.19%  as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. In August 2018, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the “AR Securitization Facility”)  with a termination date of August 31, 2021.  The maximum availability under the AR Securitization Facility is $175.0  million.  Availability is further subject to changes in the credit ratings of our customers, customer concentration levels  or certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred and, therefore, at certain times, we may not be  able to fully access the $175.0 million of funding available under the AR Securitization Facility.  The AR Securitization  Facility effectively increases the Company’s borrowing capacity by collateralizing a portion of the amount of the  Service Center Based Distribution reportable segment’s U.S. operations’ trade accounts receivable.  The Company  uses the proceeds from the AR Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt, effectively reducing  borrowing costs.  Borrowings under this facility carry variable interest rates tied to LIBOR and fees on the AR  Securitization Facility are 0.90% per year.  The interest rate on the AR Securitization Facility as of June 30, 2020 and  June 30, 2019 was 1.07% and 3.33%, respectively. The Company did not repurchase shares in ﬁscal 2020.  In ﬁscal 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 192,082 and  393,300 shares of the Company’s common stock, respectively, at an average price per share of $58.10,and $57.92,  respectively. We expect capital expenditures for ﬁscal 2021 to be in the $15.0 million to $20.0 million range, primarily consisting  of capital associated with additional information technology equipment and infrastructure investments.  Depreciation  for ﬁscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of $22.5 million to $23.5 million. The Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of shares of the Company’s stock.  These purchases may    be made in open market and negotiated transactions, from time to time, depending upon market conditions.     At June 30, 2020, we had authorization to purchase an additional 864,618 shares. The credit facility and the unsecured shelf facility contain restrictive covenants regarding liquidity, net worth, ﬁnancial  ratios, and other covenants.  At June 30, 2020, the most restrictive of these covenants required that the Company  have net indebtedness less than 3.75 times consolidated income before interest, taxes, depreciation and  amortization (as deﬁned).  At June 30, 2020, the Company's net indebtedness was less than 3.1 times consolidated  income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as deﬁned).  The Company was in compliance with all  ﬁnancial covenants at June 30, 2020. is due in October 2023.  In October 2019, the Company amended its unsecured shelf facility agreement with  Prudential Investment Management to authorize the issuance of "Series E" notes, which have a principal amount of  $25.0 million, carry a ﬁxed interest rate of 3.08%, and are due in October 2024. The Company entered into an interest rate swap which mitigates variability in forecasted interest payments on  $431.0 million of the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured variable rate debt.  For more information, see  note 7, Derivatives, to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, included in Item 8 under the caption “Financial  Statements and Supplementary Data.” Inventories are valued using the last-in, ﬁrst-out (LIFO) method for U.S. inventories and the average cost method for  foreign inventories.  As activities slowed in the second half of ﬁscal 2020, the Company took actions to reduce its  overall inventory, which resulted in a net decrease in inventory of $58.4 million.  Management uses an inventory  turnover ratio to monitor and evaluate inventory.  Management calculates this ratio on an annual as well as a  quarterly basis and uses inventory valued at average costs.  The annualized inventory turnover (using average costs)  for the period ended June 30, 2020 was 3.8 versus 4.2 at June 30, 2019.  We believe our inventory turnover ratio in  ﬁscal 2021 will be slightly better than our ﬁscal 2020 levels. Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and consist of trade receivables from customers.   Management monitors accounts receivable by reviewing Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) and the aging of receivables  for each of the Company's locations. On a consolidated basis, DSO was 55.9 at June 30, 2020 versus 55.2 at June 30, 2019. Approximately 4.6% of our accounts receivable balances are more than 90 days past due at June 30, 2020  compared to 3.0% at June 30, 2019.  On an overall basis, our provision for losses from uncollected receivables  represents 0.43% of our sales in the year ended June 30, 2020, compared to 0.12% of sales for the year ended  June 30, 2019.  This increase primarily relates to provisions recorded in the current year for customer credit  deterioration and bankruptcies primarily in the U.S. and Mexican operations of the Service Center Based Distribution  segment.  Historically, this percentage is around 0.10% to 0.15%.  Management believes the overall receivables  aging and provision for losses on uncollected receivables are at reasonable levels. June 30, 2020 2019 Accounts receivable, gross $ 463,659 $ 551,400 Allowance for doubtful accounts 13,661 10,498 Accounts receivable, net $ 449,998 $ 540,902 Allowance for doubtful accounts, % of gross receivables 2.9% 1.9% Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 Provision for losses on accounts receivable $ 14,055 $ 4,058 Provision as a % of net sales 0.43% 0.12% (1) Amounts represent estimated contractual interest payments on outstanding long-term debt obligations.  Rates in  effect as of June 30, 2020 are used for variable rate debt. Purchase orders for inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates as we are unable to  aggregate the amount of such purchase orders that represent enforceable and legally binding agreements specifying  all signiﬁcant terms.  The previous table includes the gross liability for unrecognized income tax beneﬁts including  interest and penalties in the “Other” column as the Company is unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the  timing of cash settlements, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. Inventories are valued at the average cost method, using the last-in, ﬁrst-out (LIFO) method for U.S. inventories, and  the average cost method for foreign inventories.  We adopted the link chain dollar value LIFO method for accounting  for U.S. inventories in ﬁscal 1974.  Approximately 17.3% of our domestic inventory dollars relate to LIFO layers  added in the 1970s.  The excess of average cost over LIFO cost is $155.5 million as reﬂected in our consolidated  balance sheet at June 30, 2020.  The Company maintains ﬁve LIFO pools based on the following product groupings:  bearings, power transmission products, rubber products, ﬂuid power products and other products. LIFO layers and/or liquidations are determined consistently year-to-year.  See the Inventories note to the   consolidated ﬁnancial statements in Item 8 under the caption "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,"   for further information. The preparation of ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally  accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates at a  speciﬁc point in time that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and disclosed in the  accompanying notes.  The Business and Accounting Policies note to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements describes  the signiﬁcant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.   Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the net carrying value of trade accounts receivable,  inventories, recording self-insurance liabilities and other accrued liabilities.  Estimates are also used in establishing  opening balances in relation to purchase accounting.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.  The following  critical accounting policies are impacted signiﬁcantly by judgments, assumptions and estimates used in the  preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We evaluate the recoverability of our slow-moving and inactive inventories at least quarterly.  We estimate the  recoverable cost of such inventory by product type while considering factors such as its age, historic and current  demand trends, the physical condition of the inventory, as well as assumptions regarding future demand.  Our ability  to recover our cost for slow moving or obsolete inventory can be affected by such factors as general market  conditions, future customer demand and relationships with suppliers.  A signiﬁcant portion of the products we hold  in inventory have long shelf lives, are not highly susceptible to obsolescence. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company's reserve for slow-moving or obsolete inventories was $42.9 million  and $41.1 million, respectively, recorded in inventories in the consolidated balance sheets. We evaluate the collectibility of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.  Initially, we estimate  an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience.  This initial  estimate is adjusted based on recent trends of certain customers and industries estimated to be a greater credit risk,  trends within the entire customer pool and changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable.  While we have a  large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments  in which we operate could result in higher than expected defaults, and therefore, the need to revise estimates for  bad debts.  Accounts are written off against the allowance when it becomes evident that collection will not occur. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, our allowance for doubtful accounts was 2.9% and 1.9% of gross receivables,  respectively.  Our provision for losses on accounts receivable was $14.1 million, $4.1 million and $2.8 million in ﬁscal  2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the  acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill.  Goodwill for acquired businesses is  accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities  assumed be recorded at the date of the acquisition at their respective estimated fair values.  The determination of  the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates.  These judgments can include,  but are not limited to, the cash ﬂows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate  weighted average cost of capital.  The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each  class of assets acquired, as well as the estimated life of each asset, can materially impact the net income of the  periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through  impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future.  As part of acquisition accounting, we recognize  acquired identiﬁable intangible assets such as customer relationships, vendor relationships, trade names, and non- competition agreements apart from goodwill.  Finite-lived identiﬁable intangibles are evaluated for impairment when  changes in conditions indicate carrying value may not be recoverable.  If circumstances require a ﬁnite-lived  intangible asset be tested for possible impairment, the Company ﬁrst compares undiscounted cash ﬂows expected to  be generated by the asset to the carrying value of the asset.  If the carrying value of the ﬁnite-lived intangible asset is  not recoverable on an undiscounted cash ﬂow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value  exceeds its fair value determined through a discounted cash ﬂow model. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually as of January 1, and whenever an event  occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting  unit is less than its carrying amount.  Events or circumstances that may result in an impairment review include  changes in macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall ﬁnancial  performance, other relevant entity-speciﬁc events, speciﬁc events affecting the reporting unit or sustained decrease  in share price.  Each year, the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is  more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value.  If impairment is indicated in  the qualitative assessment, or, if management elects to initially perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill, the  impairment test uses a one-step approach.  The fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount,  including goodwill.  If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit  is not impaired.  If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be  recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the  total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  Goodwill on our consolidated ﬁnancial statements relates to both the Service Center Based Distribution segment and  the Fluid Power & Flow Control segment.  The Company has eight reporting units for which an annual goodwill  impairment assessment was performed as of January 1, 2020.  The Company concluded that seven of the reporting  units’ fair value exceeded their carrying amounts by at least 10% as of January 1, 2020.   Speciﬁcally, the Canada  reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by 12%, and the Mexico reporting unit's fair value exceeded its  carrying value by 14%.  The Canada and Mexico reporting units have goodwill balances of $27.2 million and $5.2  million, respectively, as of June 30, 2020.  The carrying value of the ﬁnal reporting unit, which is comprised of the  FCX operations, exceeded the fair value, resulting in goodwill impairment of $131.0 million.  The non-cash  impairment charge was the result of the overall decline in the industrial economy, speciﬁcally slower demand in  FCX's end markets.  This led to reduced spending by customers and reduced revenue expectations.  As of June 30,  2020, the Company's goodwill balance was $540.6 million, of which $309.0 million relates to the FCX reporting  unit.  If the Company does not achieve forecasted sales growth and margin improvements goodwill could be further  impaired. The fair values of the reporting units in accordance with the goodwill impairment test were determined using the  income and market approaches.  The income approach employs the discounted cash ﬂow method reﬂecting  projected cash ﬂows expected to be generated by market participants and then adjusted for time value of money  factors, and requires management to make signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future  revenues, operating margins, and discount rates.  The market approach utilizes an analysis of comparable publicly  traded companies and requires management to make signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts  of future revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and multiples that are  applied to management’s forecasted revenues and EBITDA estimates. Changes in future results, assumptions, and estimates after the measurement date may lead to an outcome where  additional impairment charges would be required in future periods.  Speciﬁcally, actual results may vary from the  Company’s forecasts and such variations may be material and unfavorable, thereby triggering the need for future  impairment tests where the conclusions may differ in reﬂection of prevailing market conditions.  Further, continued  adverse market conditions could result in the recognition of additional impairment if the Company determines that  the fair values of its reporting units have fallen below their carrying values. Deferred income taxes are recorded for estimated future tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and  liabilities for ﬁnancial reporting and income tax purposes, giving consideration to enacted tax laws.  As of June 30,  2020, the Company recognized $38.1 million of net deferred tax liabilities.  Valuation allowances are provided  against deferred tax assets where it is considered more-likely-than-not that the Company will not realize the beneﬁt  of such assets on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis.  The remaining net deferred tax asset is the amount  management believes is more-likely-than-not of being realized.  The realization of these deferred tax assets can be  impacted by changes to tax laws, statutory rates and future taxable income levels. This Form 10-K, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis, contains statements that are forward- looking based on management’s current expectations about the future. Forward-looking statements are  often identiﬁed by qualiﬁers, such as “guidance”, “expect”, “believe”, “plan”, “intend”, “will”, “should”,  “could”, “would”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “forecast”, “may”, "optimistic" and derivative or similar  words or expressions.

Other factors and unanticipated  events could also adversely affect our business, ﬁnancial condition or results of operations. We discuss certain of these matters and other risk factors more fully throughout our Form 10-K, as well as  other of our ﬁlings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. Our market risk is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as well as changes in interest rates.   We occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall ﬁnancial risk management policy, but do not use  derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Because we operate throughout North America, Australia and New Zealand and approximately 13.1% of our ﬁscal  year 2020 net sales were generated outside the United States, foreign currency exchange rates can impact our  ﬁnancial position, results of operations and competitive position.  The ﬁnancial statements of foreign subsidiaries are  translated into their U.S. dollar equivalents at end-of-period exchange rates for assets and liabilities, while income  and expenses are translated at average monthly exchange rates.  Translation gains and losses are components of  other comprehensive loss as reported in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income.  Transaction gains  and losses arising from ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than  the functional currency are recognized in the statements of consolidated income as a component of other income,  net.  Applied does not currently hedge the net investments in our foreign operations. During the course of the ﬁscal year, the Canadian, Mexican, Australian and New Zealand currency exchange rates  decreased in relation to the U.S. dollar by 4.0%, 17.1%, 1.8% and 4.0%, respectively.  In the twelve months ended  June 30, 2020, we experienced net foreign currency translation losses totaling $18.5 million, which were included in  other comprehensive loss.  We utilize a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact on earnings based on a  hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates.  Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in  ﬁscal 2020, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect the Company from the  levels experienced during the year ended June 30, 2020 would have resulted in a $1.3 million decrease in net  income for the year ended June 30, 2020.  Excluding the non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in ﬁscal  2020, a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies that affect the Company from the levels  experienced during the year ended June 30, 2020 would have resulted in a $1.3 million increase in net income for  the year ended June 30, 2020. Our primary exposure to interest rate risk results from our outstanding debt obligations with variable interest rates.   The levels of fees and interest charged on our various debt facilities are based upon leverage levels and market  interest rates. The Company uses interest rate swap instruments to mitigate variability in forcasted interest rates. Our variable interest rate debt facilities outstanding include our ﬁve-year credit facility, which provides for a revolving  credit facility with a capacity of up to $250.0 million in borrowings with no balance outstanding at June 30, 2020, a  $780.0 million term loan, of which $589.3 million was outstanding at June 30, 2020, and a $175.0 million trade  receivable securitization facility, all of which was outstanding at June 30, 2020.  In January 2019, the Company  entered into an interest rate swap on $463.0 million of the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured variable  rate debt.  The notional amount of the interest rate swap was $431.0 million as of June 30, 2020.  The interest rate  swap effectively converts a portion of the ﬂoating rate interest payment into a ﬁxed rate interest payment.  The  Company designated the interest rate swap as a pay-ﬁxed, receive-ﬂoating interest rate swap instrument and is  accounting for this derivative as a cash ﬂow hedge.  Fixed interest rate debt facilities include $170.0 million  outstanding under our unsecured shelf facility agreement, as well as $1.0 million of assumed debt from the purchase  of our headquarters facility.  We had total average variable interest rate bank borrowings of $782.0 million during  ﬁscal 2020.  The impact of a hypothetical 1.0% increase in the interest rates on our average variable interest rate  bank borrowings (not considering the impact of our interest rate swap) would have resulted in a $7.8 million  increase in interest expense.  Due to the interest rate swap, the impact of a hypothetical 1.0% increase in the  variable interest rate would have reduced net cash interest paid by $4.3 million.  Changes in market interest rates  would also impact interest rates on these facilities. For more information relating to borrowing and interest rates, see the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of  “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and notes 6 and  7 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in Item 8.  That information is also incorporated here by reference.  In  addition, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional risk factors relating to our business. We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. and  subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of consolidated income,  comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash ﬂows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30,  2020, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "ﬁnancial  statements").  In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the ﬁnancial position of the  Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash ﬂows for each of the three years  in the period ended June 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of  America. To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United  States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on the criteria  established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of  the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 14, 2020, expressed an unqualiﬁed opinion on the Company's  internal control over ﬁnancial reporting. As discussed in Note 1 to the ﬁnancial statements, effective July 1, 2019, the Company adopted the FASB’s new  standard related to leases using the optional transition method, which required application of the new guidance to only  those leases that existed at the date of adoption. These ﬁnancial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an  opinion on the Company's ﬁnancial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting ﬁrm registered with  the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal  securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements are free of material  misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material  misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to  those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in  the ﬁnancial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and signiﬁcant estimates  made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements.  We believe that our  audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the ﬁnancial  statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to  accounts or disclosures that are material to the ﬁnancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,  subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on  the ﬁnancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing  a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to  its carrying value.  The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using the income and market  approaches.  The determination of the fair value using the income approach requires management to make signiﬁcant  estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and  amortization (EBITDA), and discount rates.  The determination of the fair value using the market approach requires  management to make signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future revenues, EBITDA and  multiples that are applied to management’s forecasted revenues and EBITDA estimates.  The goodwill balance was ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. $540.6 million as of June 30, 2020, of which $309.0 million related to the FCX reporting unit and $27.2 million related  to the Canada reporting unit.  The fair value of the FCX reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value as of the  measurement date and, therefore, an impairment charge of $131.0 million was recognized in 2020.  The fair value of  the Canada reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 12% as of the measurement date and, therefore, no  impairment was recognized. Given the nature of the FCX and Canada reporting units’ operations, the sensitivity of the business to changes in the  economy, the reporting unit’s historical performance as compared to projections, and the difference between its fair  value and the carrying value, auditing management’s judgments regarding forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA, as  well as selection of the discount rate and selection of multiples applied to management’s forecasted revenues and  EBITDA estimates for the FCX and Canada reporting units, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased  extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. Our audit procedures related to the forecasts of future revenues and EBITDA (“forecasts”), and the selection of the  discount rate and selection of multiples applied to management’s forecasted revenues and EBITDA estimates (“market  multiples”) for the FCX and Canada reporting units included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, such as controls  related to management’s forecasts and the selection of the discount rate and market multiples used. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to management’s  historical forecasts. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the forecasts to (1) historical  results, (2) internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, and (3) forecasted information  included in industry reports for the various industries the reporting units operate within.  • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the discount rate, including testing the underlying  source information and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developing a range of independent  estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the market multiples by evaluating the selected  comparable publicly traded companies and the adjustments made for differences in growth prospects and risk  proﬁles between the reporting units and the comparable publicly traded companies.  We tested the underlying  source information and mathematical accuracy of the calculations. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the fair value of the reporting units based upon  reconciling the fair values of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. We have served as the Company's auditor since 1966. See notes to consolidated financial statements.

Our leading brands, specialized services, and comprehensive knowledge serve  MRO (Maintenance, Repair & Operations) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) end users in virtually all  industrial markets through our multi-channel capabilities that provide choice, convenience, and expertise.  Although  the Company does not generally manufacture the products it sells, it does assemble and repair certain products and  systems. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements include the accounts of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. and its  subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The ﬁnancial statements of the Company’s Canadian, Mexican, Australian and New Zealand subsidiaries are  measured using local currencies as their functional currencies.  Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at  current exchange rates, while income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates.  Translation gains and  losses are reported in other comprehensive loss in the statements of consolidated comprehensive income.  Gains and  losses resulting from transactions denominated in foreign currencies are included in the statements of consolidated  income as a component of other income, net. The preparation of ﬁnancial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United  States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the ﬁnancial statements and the  reported amount of revenues and expenses during the period.  Actual results may differ from the estimates and  assumptions used in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The Company considers all short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date  of purchase to be cash equivalents.  Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. The primary marketable security investments of the Company include money market and mutual funds held in a  rabbi trust for a non-qualiﬁed deferred compensation plan.  These are included in other assets in the consolidated  balance sheets, are classiﬁed as trading securities, and are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices.   Changes in the fair value of the investments during the period are recorded in other income, net in the statements  of consolidated income. The Company has a broad customer base representing many diverse industries across North America, Australia, New  Zealand, and Singapore.  As such, the Company does not believe that a signiﬁcant concentration of credit risk exists  in its accounts receivable.  The Company’s cash and cash equivalents consist of deposits with commercial banks and  regulated non-bank subsidiaries.  While the Company monitors the creditworthiness of these institutions, a crisis in  the ﬁnancial systems could limit access to funds and/or result in the loss of principal.  The terms of these deposits  and investments provide that all monies are available to the Company upon demand. Accounts receivable are stated at their estimated net realizable value and consist of amounts billed or billable and  currently due from customers.  The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which reﬂects  management’s best estimate of probable losses based on an analysis of customer accounts, known troubled  accounts, historical experience with write-offs, and other currently available evidence. The Company evaluates the collectibility of trade accounts receivable based on a combination of factors.  Initially, the  Company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt  experience.  This initial estimate is adjusted based on recent trends of customers and industries estimated to be greater credit risks, trends within the entire customer pool, and changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable.   Accounts are written off against the allowance when it becomes evident collection will not occur.  While the  Company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed, a general economic downturn in any of the  industry segments in which the Company operates could result in higher than expected defaults, and therefore, the  need to revise estimates for bad debts. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $13,661 and $10,498 at June 30,  2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. Inventories are valued at average cost, using the last-in, ﬁrst-out (LIFO) method for U.S. inventories and the average  cost method for foreign inventories.  The Company adopted the link chain dollar value LIFO method of accounting  for U.S. inventories in ﬁscal 1974.  At June 30, 2020, approximately 17.3% of the Company’s domestic inventory  dollars relate to LIFO layers added in the 1970s.  The Company maintains ﬁve LIFO pools based on the following  product groupings: bearings, power transmission products, rubber products, ﬂuid power products and other  products.  LIFO layers and/or liquidations are determined consistently year-to-year. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its slow moving and inactive inventories at least quarterly.  The  Company estimates the recoverable cost of such inventory by product type while considering factors such as its age,  historic and current demand trends, the physical condition of the inventory, as well as assumptions regarding future  demand.  The Company’s ability to recover its cost for slow moving or obsolete inventory can be affected by such  factors as general market conditions, future customer demand, and relationships with suppliers.  Historically, the  Company’s inventories have demonstrated long shelf lives, are not highly susceptible to obsolescence, and, in certain  instances, can be eligible for return under supplier return programs. The Company enters into agreements with certain suppliers providing inventory purchase incentives.  The Company’s  inventory purchase incentive arrangements are unique to each supplier and are generally annual programs ending at  either the Company’s ﬁscal year end or the supplier’s year end; however, program length and ending dates can vary.   Incentives are received in the form of cash or credits against purchases upon attainment of speciﬁed purchase  volumes and are received either monthly, quarterly or annually.  The incentives are generally a speciﬁed percentage  of the Company’s net purchases based upon achieving speciﬁc purchasing volume levels.  These percentages can  increase or decrease based on changes in the volume of purchases.  The Company accrues for the receipt of these  inventory purchase incentives based upon cumulative purchases of inventory.  The percentage level utilized is based  upon the estimated total volume of purchases expected during the life of the program.  Supplier programs are  analyzed each quarter to determine the appropriateness of the amount of purchase incentives accrued.  Upon  program completion, differences between estimates and actual incentives subsequently received have not been  material.  Beneﬁts under these supplier purchasing programs are recognized under the Company’s inventory  accounting methods as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventories representing these purchases are recorded  as cost of sales.  Accrued incentives expected to be settled as a credit against future purchases are reported on the  consolidated balance sheets as an offset to amounts due to the related supplier. Property and equipment are recorded at cost.  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the  estimated useful lives of the assets and is included in selling, distribution and administrative expense in the  accompanying statements of consolidated income.  Buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements  are depreciated over ten to thirty years or the life of the lease if a shorter period, and equipment is depreciated over  three to ten years.  The Company capitalizes internal use software development costs in accordance with guidance  on accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use.  Amortization of software  begins when it is ready for its intended use, and is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of  the software, generally not to exceed twelve years.  Capitalized software and hardware costs are classiﬁed as  property on the consolidated balance sheets.  The carrying values of property and equipment are reviewed for  impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset group's recorded value cannot be  recovered from undiscounted future cash ﬂows.  Impairment losses, if any, would be measured based upon the  difference between the carrying amount of an asset group and its fair value. Goodwill is recognized as the excess cost of an acquired entity over the net amount assigned to assets acquired and  liabilities assumed.  Goodwill is not amortized.  Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually as of January 1 or  whenever changes in conditions indicate an evaluation should be completed.  These conditions could include a  signiﬁcant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or  disposition of a signiﬁcant portion of a reporting unit.  The Company utilizes the income and market approaches to  determine the fair value of reporting units.  Evaluating impairment requires signiﬁcant judgment by management,  including estimated future operating results, estimated future cash ﬂows, the long-term rate of growth of the  business, and determination of an appropriate discount rate.  While the Company uses available information to  prepare the estimates and evaluations, actual results could differ signiﬁcantly. The Company recognizes acquired identiﬁable intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, vendor  relationships, and non-competition agreements apart from goodwill.  Customer relationship identiﬁable intangibles  are amortized using the sum-of-the-years-digits method or the expected cash ﬂow method over estimated useful  lives consistent with assumptions used in the determination of their value.  Amortization of all other ﬁnite-lived  identiﬁable intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated period of beneﬁt.   Amortization of identiﬁable intangible assets is included in selling, distribution and administrative expense in the  accompanying statements of consolidated income.  Identiﬁable intangible assets with ﬁnite lives are reviewed for  impairment when changes in conditions indicate carrying value may not be recoverable.  If circumstances require a  ﬁnite-lived intangible asset be tested for possible impairment, the Company ﬁrst compares undiscounted cash ﬂows  expected to be generated by the asset to the carrying value of the asset.  If the carrying value of the ﬁnite-lived  intangible asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash ﬂow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that  the carrying value exceeds its fair value determined through a discounted cash ﬂow model.  Identiﬁable intangible  assets with indeﬁnite lives are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever changes in conditions  indicate an evaluation should be completed.  The Company does not currently have any indeﬁnite-lived identiﬁable  intangible assets. The Company maintains business insurance programs with signiﬁcant self-insured retention covering workers’  compensation, business, automobile, general product liability and other claims.  The Company accrues estimated  losses including those incurred but not reported using actuarial calculations, models and assumptions based on  historical loss experience.  The Company also maintains a self-insured health beneﬁts plan which provides medical  beneﬁts to U.S. based employees electing coverage under the plan.  The Company estimates its reserve for all unpaid  medical claims, including those incurred but not reported, based on historical experience, adjusted as necessary  based upon management’s reasoned judgment. The Company primarily sells purchased products distributed through its network of service centers and recognizes  revenue at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, typically upon shipment from an  Applied facility or directly from a supplier.  For products that ship directly from suppliers to customers, Applied acts  as the principal in the transaction and recognizes revenue on a gross basis.  Revenue recognized over time is not  signiﬁcant.  Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for the  products and services provided, net of allowances for product returns, variable consideration, and any taxes collected  from customers that will be remitted to governmental authorities.  Shipping and handling costs are recognized in net  sales when they are billed to the customer.  The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities  as fulﬁllment costs.  There are no signiﬁcant costs associated with obtaining customer contracts. Payment terms with customers vary by the type and location of the customer and the products or services offered.  The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of signiﬁcant ﬁnancing  components based on the expectation that the period between when the Company transfers a promised good or  service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.  Arrangements  with customers that include payment terms extending beyond one year are not signiﬁcant. The Company’s products are generally sold with a right of return and may include variable consideration in the form  of incentives, discounts, credits or rebates.  Product returns are estimated based on historical return rates.  The  returns reserve was $9,883 and $7,265 at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively.  The Company estimates and recognizes variable consideration based on historical experience to determine the  expected amount to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services  to a customer.  The Company records variable consideration as an adjustment to the transaction price in the period it is incurred.  The realization of variable consideration occurs within a short period of time from product delivery;  therefore, the time value of money effect is not signiﬁcant. The Company records freight payments to third parties in cost of sales and internal delivery costs in selling,  distribution and administrative expense in the accompanying statements of consolidated income.  Internal delivery  costs in selling, distribution and administrative expense were approximately $19,620, $24,090 and $19,320 for the  ﬁscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income taxes are determined based upon income and expenses recorded for ﬁnancial reporting purposes.  Deferred  income taxes are recorded for estimated future tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities  for ﬁnancial reporting and income tax purposes, giving consideration to enacted tax laws.  Uncertain tax positions  meeting a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are recognized in accordance with Accounting Standards  Codiﬁcation (ASC) Topic 740 - Income Taxes.  The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to  unrecognized income tax beneﬁts in the provision for income taxes. Share-based compensation represents the cost related to share-based awards granted to employees under the 2019  Long-Term Performance Plan, the 2015 Long-Term Performance Plan, the 2011 Long-Term Performance Plan, or the  2007 Long-Term Performance Plan.  The Company measures share-based compensation cost at the grant date,  based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost over the requisite service period.  Non- qualiﬁed stock appreciation rights (SARs) and stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing  market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant and the fair values are determined using a Black- Scholes option pricing model, which incorporates assumptions regarding the expected volatility, the expected option  life, the risk-free interest rate and the expected dividend yield.  SARs and stock option awards generally vest over  four years of continuous service and have ten-year contractual terms.  The fair value of restricted stock awards,  restricted stock units (RSUs), and performance shares are based on the closing market price of Company common  stock on the grant date. Shares of common stock repurchased by the Company are recorded at cost as treasury shares and result in a  reduction of shareholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company uses the weighted-average cost  method for determining the cost of shares reissued.  The difference between the cost of the shares and the  reissuance price is added to or deducted from additional paid-in capital. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value  of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a  derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting, and whether the hedging relationship has satisﬁed  the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.  Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure  to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or ﬁrm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest  rate risk, are considered fair value hedges.  Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to  variability in expected future cash ﬂows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash ﬂow hedges.  Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign  operation.  Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the  hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are  attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a  cash ﬂow hedge.  The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain  risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. In accordance with the FASB’s fair value measurement guidance, the Company made an accounting policy election  to measure the credit risk of its derivative ﬁnancial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a  net basis by counterparty portfolio. Substantially all U.S. employees participate in the Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan.   Participants may elect 401(k) contributions of up to 50% of their compensation, subject to Internal Revenue Code  maximums.  The Company partially matches 401(k) contributions by participants.  The Company’s expense for  matching of employees’ 401(k) contributions was $5,959, $7,711 and $6,551 during 2020, 2019 and 2018,  respectively. The Company has determined that the related disclosures under ASC Topic 715 - Compensation, Retirement  Beneﬁts, for these post-employment beneﬁt plans are not material to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The Company has deferred compensation plans that enable certain employees of the Company to defer receipt of a  portion of their compensation.  Assets held in these rabbi trusts consist of investments in money market and mutual  funds and Company common stock. The Company leases facilities for certain service centers, warehouses, distribution centers and ofﬁce space.  The  Company also leases ofﬁce equipment and vehicles.  All leases are classiﬁed as operating.  The Company’s leases  expire at various dates through 2031, with terms ranging from 1 year to 15 years.  Many of the Company’s real  estate leases contain renewal provisions to extend lease terms up to 5 years. The exercise of renewal options is solely  at the Company’s discretion.  The Company’s lease agreements do not contain material variable lease payments,  residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.  The Company does not recognize right-of-use assets or lease  liabilities for short-term leases with initial terms of 12 months or less.  Leased vehicles comprise the majority of the  Company’s short-term leases.  All other leases are recorded on the balance sheet with right-of-use assets  representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities representing lease payment  obligations.  The Company’s leases do not provide implicit rates; therefore the Company uses its incremental  borrowing rate as the discount rate for measuring lease liabilities.  Non-lease components are accounted for  separately from lease components.  The Company’s operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis  over the lease term and is recorded in selling, distribution and administrative expense on the statements of  consolidated income. The Company has a qualiﬁed deﬁned beneﬁt retirement plan that provides beneﬁts to certain hourly employees  at retirement.  These employees did not participate in the Retirement Savings Plan.  The beneﬁts are based on  length of service and date of retirement.  The plan accruals were frozen as of April 16, 2018, and employees are  permitted to participate in the Retirement Savings Plan, following that date.  The Company recorded net  periodic (beneﬁts) costs associated with this plan of $(116), $(34), and $149 in ﬁscal 2020, 2019, and 2018,  respectively The Company provides health care beneﬁts, through third-party policies, to eligible retired employees who pay a  speciﬁed monthly premium.  Premium payments are based upon current insurance rates for the type of coverage  provided and are adjusted annually.  Certain monthly health care premium payments are partially subsidized by  the Company.  Additionally, in conjunction with a ﬁscal 1998 acquisition, the Company assumed the obligation  for a post-retirement medical beneﬁt plan which provides health care beneﬁts to eligible retired employees at no  cost to the individual.  The Company recorded net periodic beneﬁts associated with these plans of $257, $418,  and $452 in ﬁscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company has a non-qualiﬁed pension plan to provide supplemental retirement beneﬁts to certain ofﬁcers.   Beneﬁts are payable and determinable at retirement based upon a percentage of the participant’s historical  compensation.  The Executive Organization and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors froze  participant beneﬁts (credited service and ﬁnal average earnings) and entry into the Supplemental Executive  Retirement Beneﬁts Plan (SERP) effective December 31, 2011.  The Company recorded net periodic beneﬁt costs  associated with the SERP of $317, $414, and $679 in ﬁscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  The Company  expects to make payments of approximately $800 under the SERP in each of ﬁscal 2021, 2022 and 2023. In ﬁscal 2012, the Company adopted the Key Executive Restoration Plan (KERP), a funded, non-qualiﬁed  deferred compensation plan, to replace the SERP.  The Company recorded $189, $400, and $359 of expense  associated with this plan in ﬁscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued its ﬁnal standard on the facilitation of the effects of reference rate reform on  ﬁnancial reporting.  This standard, issued as ASU 2020-04, provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to  ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference rate reform on ﬁnancial  reporting.  This update is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022.  The Company adopted the  new guidance as it became effective in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2020.  The adoption of this guidance did not have  a material impact on the Company's ﬁnancial statements or related disclosures. Leases  In February 2016, the FASB issued its ﬁnal standard on accounting for leases.  This standard, issued as ASU 2016-02,  and codiﬁed into ASC Topic 842, Leases, requires that an entity that is a lessee recognize lease assets and lease  liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  This update is  effective for annual ﬁnancial statement periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with earlier application  permitted.  In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10 which clariﬁes the guidance in ASU 2016-02 and ASU  2018-11 which provides entities with an additional transition method option for adopting the new standard.  In  December 2018 and January 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2018-20 and ASU 2019-01, respectively, which further  clarify the guidance.  The Company adopted the new guidance effective July 1, 2019 using the optional transition  method, which required application of the new guidance to only those leases that existed at the date of adoption.   The Company elected the “package of practical expedients,” which permitted the Company to not reassess under  the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identiﬁcation, lease classiﬁcation and initial direct costs.  Adoption  of the new standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities of $83,533 and  $89,778, respectively, on July 1, 2019.  The difference between the ROU assets and lease liabilities related primarily  to the impairment of certain leases in Canada and the United States.  In addition, the adoption resulted in an  adjustment to opening retained earnings of $3,275, net of tax, on July 1, 2019 primarily due to the impairment of  the leases.  The standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s statements of consolidated income or  cash ﬂows. Cash Flows In August 2016, the FASB issued its ﬁnal standard on the classiﬁcation of certain cash receipts and cash payments  within the statement of cash ﬂows.  This standard, issued as ASU 2016-15, makes a number of changes meant to  add or clarify guidance on the classiﬁcation of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash ﬂows.  This update is effective for annual and interim ﬁnancial statement periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with  early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted the new guidance in the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal 2020.  The adoption  of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's ﬁnancial statements or related disclosures. In June 2016, the FASB issued its ﬁnal standard on measurement of credit losses on ﬁnancial instruments.  This  standard, issued as ASU 2016-13, requires that an entity measure impairment of certain ﬁnancial instruments,  including trade receivables, based on expected losses rather than incurred losses.  This update is effective for annual  and interim ﬁnancial statement periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for  ﬁnancial statement periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  In November 2018, April 2019, May 2019,  November 2019, and February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-11 and  ASU 2020-02, respectively, which clarify the guidance in ASU 2016-13.  The Company has not yet determined the  impact of these pronouncements on its ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures. In December 2019, the FASB issued its ﬁnal standard on simplifying the accounting for income taxes.  This standard,  issued as ASU 2019-12, makes a number of changes meant to add or clarify guidance on accounting for income  taxes.  This update is effective for annual and interim ﬁnancial statement periods beginning after December 15,  2021, with early adoption permitted in any interim period for which ﬁnancial statements have not yet been ﬁled.   The Company has not yet determined the impact of these pronouncements on its ﬁnancial statements and related  disclosures.

On August 21, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Olympus Controls (Olympus), a  Portland, Oregon automation solutions provider - including design, assembly, integration, and distribution - of  motion control, machine vision, and robotic technologies.  Olympus is included in the Fluid Power & Flow Control  segment.

See note 6 Debt.  As a distributor of engineered valves, instruments, pumps and lifecycle services to MRO  and OEM customers across diverse industrial and process end markets, this business is included in the Fluid Power &  Flow Control Segment. On July 3, 2017, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Diseños, Construcciones y Fabricaciones  Hispanoamericanas, S.A. ("DICOFASA"), a distributor of accessories and components for hydraulic systems and  lubrication, located in Puebla, Mexico.  DICOFASA is included in the Service Center Based Distribution segment.     The purchase price for the acquisition was $5,920, net tangible assets acquired were $3,395, and goodwill was The following table summarizes the consideration transferred, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in connection  with the acquisition of FCX based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill acquired of $161,452 was deductible for income tax purposes at the time of the acquisition.  Subsequent  to the goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended June 30, 2020, $112,922 remains deductible for income  tax purposes as of June 30, 2020. The Company incurred $2,849 in third-party costs during 2018 pertaining to the acquisition of FCX, which are  included in selling, distribution and administration expense in the statements of consolidated income for ﬁscal 2018. (1) There was a $131,000 goodwill impairment charge during the year ended June 30, 2020. See note 5, Goodwill and Intangibles, for  further information. During the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal 2020, the Company recorded an adjustment to the preliminary estimated fair value  of intangible assets related to the MilRoc/Woodward acquisition.  The fair values of the customer relationships, trade  name, and other intangible assets were increased by $1,524, $1,809, and $60, respectively, with a corresponding  total decrease to goodwill of $3,393.  The changes to the preliminary estimated fair values resulted in an increase to  amortization expense of $303 during the year ended June 30, 2020, which is recorded in selling, distribution, and  administrative expense on the statements of consolidated income. During the second quarter of ﬁscal 2020, the Company recorded an adjustment to the preliminary estimated fair  value of intangible assets related to the Olympus acquisition.  The trade name and other intangible assets were  increased by $4,260 and $980, respectively, with a corresponding decrease to the customer relationship intangible  asset of $5,504 and an increase to goodwill of $264.  The changes to the preliminary estimated fair values resulted  in a decrease to amortization expense of $24 during the year ended June 30, 2020, which is recorded in selling,  distribution, and administrative expense on the statements of consolidated income. The Company has eight (8) reporting units for which an annual goodwill impairment assessment was performed as  of January 1, 2020.  The Company concluded that seven (7) of the reporting units’ fair values exceeded their carrying  amounts by at least 10% as of January 1, 2020.  Speciﬁcally, the Canada reporting unit's fair value exceeded its  carrying value by 12%, and the Mexico reporting unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by 14%.  The Canada $2,525 based upon estimated fair values at the acquisition date.  The purchase price includes $906 of acquisition  holdback payments, of which $201 and $219 was paid during ﬁscal year 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Due to  changes in foreign currency exchange rates, the remaining balance of $356 is included in other current liabilities on  the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2020, which will be paid on the third anniversary of the acquisition  date with interest at a ﬁxed rate of 1.5% per annum.  The Company funded this acquisition using available cash.   The acquisition price and the results of operations for the acquired entity are not material in relation to the  Company's consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Acquisition holdback payments of approximately $2,563, $1,448 and $75 will be made in ﬁscal 2021, 2022 and  2024, respectively.  The related liabilities for these payments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in other  current liabilities for the amounts due in ﬁscal year 2021 and other liabilities for the amounts due in ﬁscal years 2022  and 2024. June 30, 2020 2019 U.S. inventories at average cost $ 431,866 $ 473,949 Foreign inventories at average cost 112,795 125,260 544,661 599,209 Less: Excess of average cost over LIFO cost for U.S. inventories 155,511 151,654 Inventories on consolidated balance sheets $ 389,150 $ 447,555 and Mexico reporting units have goodwill balances of $27,186 and $5,185, respectively, as of June 30, 2020.  The  carrying value of the ﬁnal reporting unit, which is comprised of the FCX operations, exceeded the fair value, resulting  in goodwill impairment of $131,000.  The non-cash impairment charge is the result of the overall decline in the  industrial economy, speciﬁcally slower demand in FCX's end markets.  This has led to reduced spending by  customers and reduced revenue expectations.  The remaining goodwill for the FCX reporting unit as of June 30,  2020 is $309,012.  Because the carrying value of the FCX reporting unit approximated fair value of the reporting  unit after the impairment was recorded, a future decline in the estimated cash ﬂows could result in an additional  impairment loss.  A future decline in the estimated cash ﬂows could result from a signiﬁcant or extended decline in  various end markets. The fair values of the reporting units in accordance with the goodwill impairment test were determined using the  income and market approaches.  The income approach employs the discounted cash ﬂow method reﬂecting  projected cash ﬂows expected to be generated by market participants and then adjusted for time value of money  factors, and requires management to make signiﬁcant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future  revenues, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and discount rates.  The market  approach utilizes an analysis of comparable publicly traded companies and requires management to make signiﬁcant  estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future revenues, EBITDA, and multiples that are applied to  management’s forecasted revenues and EBITDA estimates. The techniques used in the Company's impairment test have incorporated a number of assumptions that the  Company believes to be reasonable and to reﬂect known market conditions at the measurement date.  Assumptions  in estimating future cash ﬂows are subject to a degree of judgment.  The Company makes all efforts to forecast  future cash ﬂows as accurately as possible with the information available at the measurement date.  The Company  evaluates the appropriateness of its assumptions and overall forecasts by comparing projected results of upcoming  years with actual results of preceding years.  Key assumptions (Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy) relate to pricing  trends, inventory costs, customer demand, and revenue growth.  A number of benchmarks from independent  industry and other economic publications were also used. Changes in future results, assumptions, and estimates after the measurement date may lead to an outcome where  additional impairment charges would be required in future periods.  Speciﬁcally, actual results may vary from the  Company’s forecasts and such variations may be material and unfavorable, thereby triggering the need for future  impairment tests where the conclusions may differ in reﬂection of prevailing market conditions.  Further, continued  adverse market conditions could result in the recognition of additional impairment if the Company determines that  the fair values of its reporting units have fallen below their carrying values.  Certain events or circumstances that  could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the  estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future  cash ﬂows, speciﬁcally, a decrease in sales volume driven by a prolonged weakness in customer demand or other  pressures adversely affecting our long-term sales trends; and (ii) inability to achieve the sales targeted by our strategic  growth initiatives. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, accumulated goodwill impairment losses subsequent to ﬁscal year 2002 totaled  $64,794 related to the Service Center Based Distribution segment.  At June 30, 2020 and 2019, accumulated  goodwill impairment losses subsequent to ﬁscal year 2002 totaled $167,605 and $36,605, respectively, related to  the Fluid Power & Flow Control segment. Amounts include the impact of foreign currency translation.  Fully amortized amounts are written off. Due to a sustained decline in economic conditions in the upstream oil and gas industry in western Canada, management also assessed the long-lived intangible assets related to the Reliance asset group in Canada for impairment during the third quarter of ﬁscal 2019.  The Reliance asset group is located in western Canada and primarily serves customers in the upstream oil and gas industry.  The asset group carrying value exceeded the sum of the undiscounted cash ﬂows, indicating impairment.  The fair value of the asset group was then determined using  the income approach, using Level 3 assumptions in the fair value hierarchy, and the analysis resulted in the  measurement of a full impairment loss of $31,594, which was recorded in the third quarter of ﬁscal 2019.   Sustained signiﬁcant softness in certain end market concentrations could result in impairment of certain intangible  assets in future periods. Amortization of identiﬁable intangibles totaled $41,553, $41,883 and $32,065 in ﬁscal 2020, 2019 and 2018,  respectively, and is included in selling, distribution and administrative expense in the statements of consolidated  income.  Future amortization expense based on the Company’s identiﬁable intangible assets as of June 30, 2020 is  estimated to be $38,300 for 2021, $36,100 for 2022, $34,000 for 2023, $29,800 for 2024 and $26,300 for 2025.

This agreement provides for a $780,000 unsecured term loan and a  $250,000 unsecured revolving credit facility.  Fees on this facility range from 0.10% to 0.20% per year based upon  the Company's leverage ratio at each quarter end.  Borrowings under this agreement carry variable interest rates tied  to either LIBOR or prime at the Company's discretion.  The Company had no amount outstanding under the revolver  as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019.  Unused lines under this facility, net of outstanding letters of credit of  $1,873 and $3,215, respectively, to secure certain insurance obligations, totaled $248,127 and $246,785 at  June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and were available to fund future acquisitions or other capital and  operating requirements.  The interest rate on the term loan was 1.94% and 4.19% as of June 30, 2020 and  June 30, 2019, respectively. Additionally, the Company had letters of credit outstanding with a separate bank, not associated with the revolving credit agreement, in the amount of $4,475 and $2,698 as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, in order to secure certain insurance obligations. In August 2018, the Company established a trade receivable securitization facility (the “AR Securitization Facility”)  with a termination date of August 31, 2021.  The maximum availability under the AR Securitization Facility is  $175,000.  Availability is further subject to changes in the credit ratings of our customers, customer concentration  levels or certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred and, therefore, at certain times, we may  not be able to fully access the $175,000 of funding available under the AR Securitization Facility.  The AR  Securitization Facility effectively increases the Company’s borrowing capacity by collateralizing a portion of the  amount of the Service Center Based Distribution reportable segment’s U.S. operations’ trade accounts receivable.   The Company uses the proceeds from the AR Securitization Facility as an alternative to other forms of debt,  effectively reducing borrowing costs.  Borrowings under this facility carry variable interest rates tied to LIBOR and  fees on the AR Securitization Facility are 0.90% per year.  The interest rate on the AR Securitization Facility as of  June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 was 1.07% and 3.33%, respectively. At June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, the Company had borrowings outstanding under its unsecured shelf facility  agreement with Prudential Investment Management of $170,000.  Fees on this facility range from 0.25% to 1.25%  per year based on the Company's leverage ratio at each quarter end.  The "Series C" notes have a principal amount  of $120,000, carry a ﬁxed interest rate of 3.19%, and are due in equal principal payments in July 2020, 2021, and  2022.  A $40,000 principal payment was made on the "Series C" notes in July 2020.  The "Series D" notes have a  principal amount of $50,000 and carry a ﬁxed interest rate of 3.21%.  A $25,000 principal payment was made on  the "Series D" notes during ﬁscal 2020, and the remaining principal balance of $25,000 is due in October 2023.  In  October 2019, the Company amended its unsecured shelf facility agreement with Prudential Investment  management to authorize the issuance of "Series E" notes, which have a principal amount of $25,000, carry a ﬁxed  interest rate of 3.08%, and are due in October 2024. In 2014, the Company assumed $2,359 of debt as a part of the headquarters facility acquisition.  The 1.50% ﬁxed  interest rate note is held by the State of Ohio Development Services Agency, maturing in May 2024. NOTE 8: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Marketable securities measured at fair value at June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019 totaled $12,259 and $11,246,  respectively.  The majority of these marketable securities are held in a rabbi trust for a non-qualiﬁed deferred The credit facility and the unsecured shelf facility contain restrictive covenants regarding liquidity, net worth, ﬁnancial  ratios, and other covenants.  At June 30, 2020, the most restrictive of these covenants required that the Company  have net indebtedness less than 3.75 times consolidated income before interest, taxes, depreciation and  amortization (as deﬁned).  At June 30, 2020, the Company's net indebtedness was less than 3.1 times consolidated  income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as deﬁned).  The Company was in compliance with all  ﬁnancial covenants at June 30, 2020. The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions.  The  Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management  of its core business activities.  The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk  primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative  ﬁnancial instruments.  Speciﬁcally, the Company enters into derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage exposures  that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts,  the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company’s derivative ﬁnancial instruments are used to  manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its  known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s borrowings. The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its  exposure to interest rate movements.  To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps  as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash ﬂow hedges involve the  receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making ﬁxed-rate payments over the  life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash ﬂow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently reclassiﬁed into interest expense in the same  period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  Amounts reported in accumulated other  comprehensive loss related to derivatives will be reclassiﬁed to interest expense as interest payments are made on  the Company’s variable-rate debt. In January 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to mitigate variability in forecasted interest  payments on $463,000 of the Company’s U.S. dollar-denominated unsecured variable rate debt.  The interest rate  swap effectively converts a portion of the ﬂoating rate interest payment into a ﬁxed rate interest payment.  The  Company designated the interest rate swap as a pay-ﬁxed, receive-ﬂoating interest rate swap instrument and is  accounting for this derivative as a cash ﬂow hedge.  The interest rate swap converts $431,000 of variable rate debt  to a rate of 4.36% as of June 30, 2020 and as of June 30, 2019 converted $463,000 of variable rate debt to a rate  of 4.36%.  The fair value (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) of the interest rate cash ﬂow hedge was $26,179 and  $14,202 as of June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, which is included in other current liabilities and other  liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.  Realized losses related to the interest rate cash ﬂow hedge were not  material in the years ended June 30, 2020 or 2019. compensation plan.  The marketable securities are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and  their fair values were valued using quoted market prices (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy). As of June 30, 2020, the carrying value of the Company's ﬁxed interest rate debt outstanding under its unsecured  shelf facility agreement with Prudential Investment Management approximates fair value (Level 2 in the fair value  hierarchy). The revolving credit facility and the term loan contain variable interest rates and their carrying values approximate fair  value (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). During the third quarter of ﬁscal 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted  in the U.S.  As a result of the CARES Act, the Company recorded a $1,000 tax beneﬁt related to the carryback of a  tax net operating loss incurred in a year in which the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate was 21% to a year in  which the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate was higher. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") was enacted in the U.S., making signiﬁcant changes  to U.S. tax law.  The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies  to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax  deferred, generally eliminated U.S. federal income tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, and created new taxes  on certain foreign-sourced earnings.  During ﬁscal 2018, the Company revised its estimated annual effective tax rate  to reﬂect the change in the federal statutory rate from 35% to 21%.  The rate change was administratively effective  as of the beginning of the Company's ﬁscal 2018, resulting in a blended statutory rate for ﬁscal 2018 of 28.06%.   The SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provided guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Act for which the  accounting under ASC 740 was incomplete.  To the extent that a company's accounting for certain income tax  effects of the Act was incomplete but it was able to determine a reasonable estimate, it was required to record a  provisional estimate in the ﬁnancial statements.  If a company could not determine a provisional estimate to be  included in the ﬁnancial statements, it should continue to apply ASC 740 on the basis of the provisions of the tax  laws that were in effect immediately before enactment of the Act.  As of June 30, 2019, the Company recorded a  net tax expense of $5,802 related to the one time transition tax and re-measurement of deferred tax balances.

Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets where it is considered more-likely-than-not that the  Company will not realize the beneﬁt of such assets.  The remaining net deferred tax asset is the amount  management believes is more-likely-than-not of being realized.  The realization of these deferred tax assets can be  impacted by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future income levels.  During the year ended June 30, 2020,  the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $2,124 related to certain deferred tax assets in Canada due to the  uncertainty in realizing these net deferred tax assets. As of June 30, 2020, the Company had accumulated undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries of  approximately $114,070.  The vast majority of such earnings have previously been subjected to the one-time  transition tax or the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income ("GILTI") inclusion implemented by the Act.  Therefore, any  additional taxes due with respect to such earnings or the excess of the amount for ﬁnancial reporting over the tax  basis of our foreign investments would generally be limited to foreign withholding and state income taxes.  In  addition, we expect foreign tax credits would be available to either offset or partially reduce the tax cost in the event  of a distribution.  We intend, however, to indeﬁnitely reinvest these earnings and expect future U.S. cash generation  to be sufﬁcient to meet future U.S. cash needs. The Company and its subsidiaries ﬁle income tax returns in U.S. federal, various state, local and foreign jurisdictions.   The following table sets forth the changes in the amount of unrecognized tax beneﬁts for the years ended June 30,  2020 and 2019: The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes.  During 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $256 and $161 of expense, respectively, for interest and penalties  related to unrecognized income tax beneﬁts in its statements of consolidated income.  The Company had a liability  for penalties and interest of $1,094 and $838 as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  The Company does not  anticipate a signiﬁcant change to the total amount of unrecognized income tax beneﬁts within the next twelve  months.  Included in the balance of unrecognized income tax beneﬁts at June 30, 2020 and 2019 are $4,708 and  $4,701, respectively, of income tax beneﬁts that, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rate. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for the tax years 2017 through 2020 and to state  and local income tax examinations for the tax years 2014 through 2020.  In addition, the Company is subject to  foreign income tax examinations for the tax years 2013 through 2020. The Company’s unrecognized income tax beneﬁts are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  since payment of cash is not expected within one year, or as a reduction of a deferred tax asset. At June 30, 2020, 128 shares of the Company’s common stock held as treasury shares were restricted as collateral  under escrow arrangements relating to change in control and director and ofﬁcer indemniﬁcation agreements. Changes in the accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, are  comprised of the following amounts, shown net of taxes: Basic net income per share is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.  Diluted net  income per share includes the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding.  Under the two-class method  of computing net income per share, non-vested share-based payment awards that contain rights to receive non- forfeitable dividends are considered participating securities.  The Company’s participating securities include Restricted  Stock Units ("RSUs") and restricted stock awards.  The Company calculated basic and diluted net income per share  under both the treasury stock method and the two-class method.  For the years presented there were no material  differences in the net income per share amounts calculated using the two methods.  Accordingly, the treasury stock  method is disclosed below. Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Net Income $ 24,042 $ 143,993 $ 141,625 Average Shares Outstanding:   Weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic computation 38,658 38,670 38,752 Dilutive effect of potential common shares 341 490 529 Weighted-average common shares outstanding for dilutive computation 38,999 39,160 39,281 Net Income Per Share — Basic $ 0.62 $ 3.72 $ 3.65 Net Income Per Share — Diluted $ 0.62 $ 3.68 $ 3.61 Cost of these programs will be recognized as expense over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of  2.0 years.  The aggregate number of shares of common stock which may be awarded under the 2019 Plan is 2,250;  shares available for future grants at June 30, 2020 were 2,221. Such amounts are included in selling, distribution and administrative expense in the accompanying statements of  consolidated income.  The total income tax beneﬁt recognized in the statements of consolidated income for share- based compensation plans was $2,189, $2,709 and $1,923 for ﬁscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.  It  has been the practice of the Company to issue shares from treasury to satisfy requirements of awards paid with  shares. Stock awards relating to 726, 226 and 66 shares of common stock were outstanding at June 30, 2020, 2019 and  2018, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the ﬁscal years then  ended as they were anti-dilutive. Following approval by the Company's shareholders in October 2019, the 2019 Long-Term Performance Plan (the  "2019 Plan") replaced the 2015 Long-Term Performance Plan.  The 2019 Plan, which expires in 2024, provides for  granting of SARs, stock options, stock awards, cash awards, and such other awards or combination thereof as the  Executive Organization and Compensation Committee or, in the case of director awards, the Corporate Governance  Committee of the Board of Directors (together referred to as the Committee) may determine to ofﬁcers, other key  employees and members of the Board of Directors.  Grants are generally made at regularly scheduled committee  meetings.  Compensation costs charged to expense under award programs paid (or to be paid) with shares  (including SARs, stock options, performance shares, restricted stock, and RSUs) are summarized in the table below: Average Expected Period of Expected Recognition (Years) SARs and options $ 4,113 2.2 Performance shares 4,580 1.8 Restricted stock and RSUs 3,028 2.1 Total unrecognized compensation costs under award programs $ 11,721 2.0 The expected life is based upon historical exercise experience of the ofﬁcers, other key employees and  members of the Board of Directors.  The risk free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds  with remaining terms equal to the expected life of the SARs and stock options.  The assumed dividend yield  has been estimated based upon the Company’s historical results and expectations for changes in dividends 2020 2019 2018 Expected life, in years 6.2 6.0 6.0 Risk free interest rate 1.6% 2.8% 2.1% Dividend yield 2.3% 1.8% 2.5% Volatility 23.7% 22.5% 24.3% Per share fair value of SARs granted during the year $10.12 $16.15 $11.25 and stock prices.  The volatility assumption is calculated based upon historical daily price observations of the  Company’s common stock for a period equal to the expected life. SARs are redeemable solely in Company common stock.  The exercise price of stock option awards may be  settled by the holder with cash or by tendering Company common stock. The total fair value of shares vested during ﬁscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $2,285, $1,846, and $2,149,  respectively. Performance shares are paid in shares of Applied stock at the end of a three-year period provided the  Company achieves goals established by the Committee.  The number of Applied shares payable will vary  depending on the level of the goals achieved. The weighted-average remaining contractual terms for SARs and stock options outstanding, exercisable, and  expected to vest at June 30, 2020 were 6.0, 4.7, and 6.0 years, respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic values of  SARs and stock options outstanding, exercisable, and expected to vest at June 30, 2020 were $20,862  $16,795, and $20,780, respectively.  The aggregate intrinsic value of the SARs and stock options exercised  during ﬁscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $3,460, $3,363, and $1,765, respectively. The Committee set three one-year goals for each of the 2020, 2019, and 2018 grants.  Each ﬁscal year  during the three-year term has its own separate goals, tied to the Company’s earnings before interest, tax,  depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and after-tax return on assets (ROA).  Achievement during any  particular ﬁscal year is awarded and “banked” for payout at the end of the three-year term.  For the  outstanding grants as of June 30, 2020, the maximum number of shares that could be earned in future  periods was 79.

Operating lease costs and  short-term lease costs were $33,152 and $10,581 for the year ended June 30, 2020, respectively.  Rental expense  incurred for operating leases under ASC Topic 840, Leases, was $45,000 for the year ended June 30, 2019.  Variable  lease costs and sublease income were not material.

Restricted  stock awards vest over periods of one to four years.  RSUs are grants valued in shares of Applied stock, but  shares are not issued until the grants vest three to ﬁve years from the award date, assuming continued  employment with Applied.  Applied primarily pays dividend equivalents on RSUs on a current basis, however  dividend equivalents on RSU grants under the 2019 Plan will be paid upon vesting. Year Ended June 30, 2020 (Share amounts in thousands) Non-vested, beginning of year 89 $ 59.93 Granted 81 56.74 Vested (40) 53.60 Non-vested, end of year 130 $ 59.91 The Company's reportable segments are: Service Center Based Distribution and Fluid Power & Flow Control.  These  reportable segments contain the Company's various operating segments which have been aggregated based upon  similar economic and operating characteristics.  The Service Center Based Distribution segment operates through  local service centers and distribution centers with a focus on providing products and services addressing the  maintenance and repair of motion control infrastructure and production equipment.  Products primarily include  industrial bearings, motors, belting, drives, couplings, pumps, linear motion products, hydraulic and pneumatic  components, ﬁltration supplies, and hoses, as well as other related supplies for general operational needs of  customers’ machinery and equipment.  The Fluid Power & Flow Control segment includes our operations that  specialize in distributing, engineering, designing, integrating, and repairing hydraulic and pneumatic ﬂuid power  technologies, and engineered ﬂow control products and services. The accounting policies of the Company’s reportable segments are generally the same as those described in note 1.   Intercompany sales, primarily from the Fluid Power & Flow Control segment to the Service Center Based Distribution  segment of $29,582, $28,677, and $25,556, in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, have been eliminated in the  following table. The Company maintains lease agreements for many of the operating facilities of businesses it acquires from previous  owners.  In many cases, the previous owners of the business acquired become employees of Applied and occupy  management positions within those businesses.  The payments under lease agreements of this nature  totaled $2,500 in 2020 and $2,400 in both 2019 and 2018, respectively. Fluctuations in corporate and other expense, net, are due to changes in corporate expenses, as well as in the  amounts and levels of certain expenses being allocated to the segments.  The expenses being allocated include  corporate charges for working capital, logistics support and other items. Long-lived assets are based on physical locations and are comprised of the net book value of property, intangible  assets and right of use assets.  Information by geographic area is as follows: NOTE 14: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is a party to various pending judicial and administrative proceedings.  Based on circumstances  currently known, the Company does not expect that the ultimate resolution of any of these matters will have, either  individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated ﬁnancial position, results of  operations, or cash ﬂows. We have evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to June 30, 2020 through the date the ﬁnancial  statements were issued. On August 7, 2020, there were 3,742 shareholders of record including 2,522 shareholders in the Applied Industrial  Technologies, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan.  The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.   The closing price on August 7, 2020 was $67.26 per share. The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year-to-date.  This is due to  changes in the number of weighted shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period. Cost of sales for interim ﬁnancial statements are computed using estimated gross proﬁt percentages which are adjusted  throughout the year based upon available information.  Adjustments to actual cost are primarily made based on  periodic physical inventory and the effect of year-end inventory quantities on LIFO costs. Fiscal 2020 The decline in net sales in the third and fourth quarters of ﬁscal 2020 is due to slowness in key end markets largely  attributable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal 2020, the Company adopted ASC 842 – accounting for leases.  Adoption of the new  standard resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $83.5 million and $89.8 million,  respectively, on July 1, 2019.  In addition, the adoption resulted in an adjustment to opening retained earnings of  approximately $3.3 million, net of tax, on July 1, 2019.  During the ﬁrst quarter of ﬁscal 2020, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Olympus Controls, a  Portland, Oregon based full-service provider of innovative technologies and complete engineered solutions for original  equipment manufacturers, machine builders, integrators, and end users.  Olympus Controls is included in the Fluid  Power & Flow Control segment.  The purchase price for the acquisition was $36.6 million. During the third quarter of ﬁscal 2020, the Company recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $131.0  million related to the operations of FCX Performance, Inc. (FCX) within the Company's Fluid Power & Flow Control  segment. During the third quarter of ﬁscal 2020, the Company incurred certain non-routine charges primarily related to its U.S.  operations in the Service Center Based Distribution segment.  Total non-routine charges reduced gross proﬁt by $3.9  million, increased the operating loss by $6.0 million, and increased the quarter net loss by $3.6 million. Fiscal 2019 During the third quarter of ﬁscal 2019, the Company acquired substantially all of the net assets of MilRoc Distribution  and Woodward Steel for a purchase price of $35.0 million.  MilRoc Distribution is an Oklahoma based distributor of  oilﬁeld speciﬁc products, namely pumps and valves, as well as equipment repair services and industrial trailer parts to  the oil & gas industry.  Woodward Steel is a Woodward, Oklahoma based steel supplier to the oil & gas and agriculture  industries.  MilRoc Distribution and Woodward steel are both included in the Service Center Based Distribution  segment.

Total restructuring charges reduced gross proﬁt for the quarter by $0.7 million and operating income by  $2.3 million. During the third quarter of ﬁscal 2019, the Company performed an impairment analysis for certain long-lived intangible  assets related to the Company's upstream oil & gas operations in Canada as a result of the continued decline in the oil  & gas industry in Western Canada.  As a result of this test, the Company determined that the net book values of these  long-lived intangible assets were impaired and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $31.6 million.  The  Company also recorded a valuation allowance against its Canadian deferred tax assets of $3.8 million. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting None. The Company's management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO)  and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures,  as deﬁned in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on that  evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. The Management of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate  internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.  Internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed by, or under  the supervision of, the President & Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and the Vice President - Chief Financial Ofﬁcer &  Treasurer, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide  reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial  statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of  America. The Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the transactions and dispositions of  the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the  United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance  with authorizations of the Company’s Management and Board of Directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance  regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets  that could have a material effect on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Because of inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting can provide only reasonable, not absolute,  assurance with respect to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and may not  prevent or detect misstatements.  Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal control over  ﬁnancial reporting may vary over time. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting  as of June 30, 2020.  This evaluation was based on the criteria set forth in the framework "Internal Control -  Integrated Framework (2013)" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.   Based on this evaluation, Management determined that the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was  effective as of June 30, 2020. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche  LLP, an independent registered public accounting ﬁrm, as stated in their report which is included herein. /s/ Neil A. Schrimsher  /s/ David K. Wells President & Chief Executive Ofﬁcer  Vice President - Chief Financial Ofﬁcer & Treasurer AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. There have not been any changes in internal control over ﬁnancial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2020  that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over  ﬁnancial reporting.  As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a signiﬁcant portion of our workforce began working  remotely in March 2020.  These changes to the working environment did not have a material effect on our internal  controls over ﬁnancial reporting during the most recent quarter.  We are continually monitoring and assessing the  COVID-19 pandemic on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness. We have audited the internal control over ﬁnancial reporting of Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries  (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the  Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting as of June 30, 2020,  based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.  We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United  States) (PCAOB), the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2020, of the Company  and our report dated August 14, 2020, expressed an unqualiﬁed opinion on those consolidated ﬁnancial statements  and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's adoption of the FASB's new standard related to  leases. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting and for its  assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over ﬁnancial reporting, included in the accompanying  Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the  Company’s internal control over ﬁnancial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting ﬁrm registered with  the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal  securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over ﬁnancial reporting was  maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over ﬁnancial  reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating  effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered  necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding  the reliability of ﬁnancial reporting and the preparation of ﬁnancial statements for external purposes in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over ﬁnancial reporting includes those policies  and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reﬂect the  transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are  recorded as necessary to permit preparation of ﬁnancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of  management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely  detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on  the ﬁnancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over ﬁnancial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become  inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may  deteriorate.

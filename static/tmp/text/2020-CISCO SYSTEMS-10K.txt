Cisco  designs  and  sells  a  broad  range  of  technologies  that  have  been  powering  the  Internet  since  1984.  We  are  integrating  intent-based  technologies  across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud. These technologies are designed to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks. This will enable us to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business. We conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into the following three geographic segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC). Our products and technologies are grouped into the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms; Applications; Security and Other Products. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service offerings, including technical support services and advanced services. Increasingly, we are delivering our technologies through software and services. Our customers include businesses of all sizes, public institutions, governments, and service providers. These customers often look to us as a strategic partner to help them use information technology (IT) to differentiate themselves and drive positive business outcomes. We were incorporated in California in December 1984, and our headquarters are in San Jose, California. The mailing address of our headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, and our telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. Our website is www.cisco.com.

As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud environment, the network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace and our mission is to inspire new possibilities for them by helping transform their infrastructure, expand applications and analytics, address their security needs, and empower their teams. We believe that our customers are looking for intent-based networks that provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments. Our vision is to deliver highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms for our customers. We are expanding our research and development (R&D) investments in certain product areas including cloud security, cloud collaboration, and application insights and  analytics.  We  are  investing  to  optimize  our  product  offerings  for  application  to  education,  healthcare  and  other  specific  industries.  We  are  also  making investments to enable us to increase automation and support the customer as the workplace changes. In addition, we continue to remain focused on investments around Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN), multicloud environments, 5G and WiFi-6, 400G speeds, optical networking, next generation silicon and artificial intelligence (AI). We are also accelerating our efforts to enable the delivery of network functionality as a service. Item 1. Business PART I Our intent-based networking strategy began with Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) technology, one of our leading enterprise architectures. We announced the initial development of new network product offerings featuring our intent-based networking technology with the launch of the Catalyst 9000 series of switches. Our intent-based networking platform is designed to be intelligent, highly secure, powered by “intent” and informed by “context”— features aiming to constantly learn, adapt, automate and protect in order to optimize network operations and defend against an evolving cyber threat landscape. Our intent-based networking offerings are designed to provide a single, highly secure network fabric that helps ensure policy consistency and network assurance; enables faster launches of new business  services;  and  significantly  improves  issue  resolution  times  while  being  open  and  extendable.  SD-Access,  built  on  the  principles  of  Cisco  Digital Networking Architecture (DNA), provides what we see as a transformational shift in the building and managing of networks. Our Catalyst 9000 series of switches represented  the  initial  build  in  our  campus  portfolio  of  our  intent-based  networking  capabilities  and  provide  highly  differentiated  advancements  in  security, programmability, and performance while lowering operating costs through innovations in hardware and software. Since the initial launch, we have continued to transform our enterprise access portfolio by bringing together several technologies to form the only integrated, intent-based architecture, with security at the foundation. This architecture is designed to help our customers connect their users and devices over any network, to applications and data, no matter where they are. We have introduced several innovations that extend our intent-based networking capabilities to wireless and enterprise routing products, including SD-WAN and Internet of Things (IoT) edge platforms. Our SD-WAN solutions are designed to provide direct branch to cloud connectivity, enabling the workforce to access their software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and workloads in an optimized and highly secure manner. To further our innovation in this area, we are applying the latest technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics to operate and enhance network capabilities. These new network product offerings are designed to enable customers to detect cybersecurity threats, for instance in encrypted traffic. We have created what is in our view the only network that is designed for security while maintaining privacy. Our  customers  are  operating  in  multicloud  environments  with  private,  public  and  hybrid  clouds.  For  the  data  center,  our  strategy  is  to  deliver  multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency regardless of where applications or data reside by extending our Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and our hyperconverged offerings. In fiscal 2020, we announced details of our technology strategy for the Internet for the Future aimed at addressing the broad adoption of multicloud and application environments. We have made significant investments in the development of software, silicon and optics — what we believe are the building blocks for the Internet for the future. We introduced Cisco Silicon One, a single unified silicon architecture, as well as the Cisco 8000 carrier-class router family built on Silicon One and our new operating system. In our view, over the next several years, customers will be increasingly writing modern software applications that can run on any hybrid cloud, and will be adding billions of connections to their environment. They will need to be able to build applications quickly, deploy them nearly anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time. We believe we are uniquely positioned to enable successful business outcomes for customers in hybrid and multicloud environments. In our view, the network is increasingly critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms. As our customers navigate the multicloud world, the need to connect new devices, protect their assets and monitor cloud consumption, they will require advisory cloud services that are provided in a consistent manner. We are focused on enabling simple, intelligent, automated and highly secure clouds by delivering the infrastructure to navigate complex IT environments through our software and subscription-based offerings including Webex, Meraki cloud networking, and certain other Security and Application offerings. We believe that customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique, recognizing that we offer a solution for all cloud environments, including private, hybrid and public clouds. We believe data is one of our customers' most strategic assets, and this data is increasingly distributed across every organization and ecosystem, on customer premises, at the edge of the network, and in the cloud. As such, we believe that security is the top IT priority for many of our customers. Our security strategy is focused on delivering an effective cybersecurity architecture combining network, cloud and endpoint-based solutions. Our portfolio is designed to prevent, detect, and remediate a cyber-attack and to integrate security across networking domains. Our intent is to enable our customers to secure their networks for a multicloud world by delivering a platform that continuously detects threats and verifies trust. By combining a number of security technologies, we are delivering an end-to-end, zero-trust architecture. Additionally, through our offerings we help our customers shorten the time between threat detection and response. Our  customers’  communications  continue  to  evolve  as  we  move  to  a  digital,  cloud-based  world.  As  people  are  an  important  competitive  advantage  for  our customers, teams need effective and simple ways to work better together and interact with their customers to build better relationships and increase collaboration. As an example, we believe our collaboration portfolio which includes our subscription-based Webex conferencing platform, is at the center of our customers’ strategy for enabling teams to increase productivity. We are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Historically, our various networking technology products have aligned with their respective product categories. However, increasingly our offerings are crossing multiple product categories. As our core networking evolves, we expect we will add more common software features across our core networking platforms. We are increasing the amount of software offerings that we provide and the proportion of subscription software offerings. We have various types of software arrangements including system software, on premise software, hybrid software and SaaS offerings. In terms of monetization, our software offerings fall into the broad categories of subscription arrangements, including SaaS and term licenses, and perpetual licenses. As part of the transformation of our business, we continued to make strides during fiscal 2020 to develop and sell more software and subscription-based offerings. We are also focused on the entire customer lifecycle to drive expansion and renewals. For a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs,  our operating  results  and market  share  may suffer.”  For information  regarding  sales  of our major  products and services,  see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Infrastructure Platforms consist of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and data center products that are designed to work together to deliver networking capabilities and transport and/or store data. These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We believe it is critical for us to continue to deliver continuous value to our customers. We continued to make progress in shifting more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio, and in expanding our software offerings. Our objective is to continue moving to cloud-managed solutions across our enterprise networking portfolio. We continue to expand on our intent-based infrastructure, which focuses on simplicity, automation, and security, allowing enterprises to manage and govern the interactions of users, devices and applications across their IT environments. We started with our Nexus 9000 series of switches for the data center, which along with ACI provide enhancements in security, programmability and performance while lowering operating costs. Our Cisco Catalyst 9000 series of switches were developed for security, mobility, IoT, and the cloud. These switches formed the foundation for our leading enterprise architectures, built on the principles of Cisco DNA. We continued to expand on this technology by extending SD-Access and Cisco DNA Center across our enterprise networking portfolio and by extending ACI to the public and private cloud. In addition, we now have a unified operating system and policy management platform for our enterprise networking portfolio to drive simplicity and consistency across our customers’ networks. Our switching portfolio encompasses campus switching as well as data center switching offerings. Our campus switching offerings provide the foundation for converged data, voice, video, and IoT services. These switches offer enhanced security and reliability and are designed to scale efficiently as our customers grow. Within campus switching are our Catalyst 9000 series of switches that include hardware with embedded software, along with a software subscription referred to as Cisco DNA. Cisco DNA provides automation, analytics and security features and can be centrally monitored, managed, and configured. Our data center switching offerings provide the foundation for mission critical data centers with high availability, scalability, and security across traditional data centers and private and public cloud data centers. We continue to add deeper and broader visibility  and analytics across our networks and applications,  enabling us to deliver better experiences for our customers. Our routing portfolio interconnects public and private wireline and mobile networks, delivering highly secure and reliable connectivity to campus, data center and branch networks. Our routing solutions are designed to meet the scale, reliability, and security needs of our customers. We introduced the principles of Cisco DNA into our routing portfolio by integrating SD-WAN into our offerings. In fiscal 2020, we launched the Cisco 8000 portfolio, a family of high density, low power next generation routing platforms focused on our customers' evolution to support 100G and 400G connectivity speeds. Our Wireless portfolio provides indoor and outdoor wireless coverage designed for seamless roaming use of voice, video, and data applications. These products include  wireless  access  points  that  are  standalone,  controller  appliance-based,  switch-converged,  and  Meraki  cloud-managed  offerings.  We  expanded  our capabilities to include network assurance and automation through Cisco DNA and Cisco DNA Spaces location-based services. Our Catalyst and Meraki Wi-Fi 6- based access points are designed for high-density public or private environments to improve speed, performance, and capacity for wireless networking in both homes and enterprises. Our  Data  Center  portfolio  incorporates  various  technologies  and  solutions  including  the  Cisco  Unified  Computing  System,  our  hyperconverged  offering, HyperFlex, and software management capabilities which combine computing, networking, and storage infrastructure management and virtualization to deliver agility, simplicity and scale. These products are designed to extend the power and simplicity of unified computing for data-intensive workloads, applications at the edge of the network, and the next generation of distributed application architectures. The  Applications  product  category  consists  primarily  of  software-related  offerings  that  utilize  the  core  networking  and  data  center  platforms  to  provide  their functions.  Our  Applications  offerings  consist  of  both  hardware  and  software-based  solutions,  including  both  software  licenses  and  software-as-a-service. Applications  include  our  collaboration  offerings  (unified  communications,  Cisco  TelePresence  and  conferencing)  as  well  as  AppDynamics  and  IoT  software offerings. Our Collaboration strategy is to make communications more effective, comprehensive, and less complex by creating innovative solutions through combining the power of software, hardware, and the network. We offer end-to-end solutions which can be delivered from the cloud, premise or mixed environments, and which integrate voice, video, and messaging on fixed and mobile networks across a wide range of devices/endpoints such as mobile phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers,  video  units,  and  collaboration  appliances.  Our  Cognitive  Collaboration  integrates  AI  and  machine  learning  across  the  Webex  portfolio,  bringing intelligence and context to help our customers work smarter and increase productivity. Our Webex Cloud Contact Center solution is designed to provide the agility, flexibility,  scalability,  security,  efficiency  and  innovation  in  order  to  enable  better  customer  experiences  for  businesses  and  their  customers.  For  on-premise collaboration markets, we launched multi-party Internet Protocol (IP) Phones to extend our reach into third-party call control platforms as well as a new series of telephony headsets which offer innovative integration with our market leading IP phone business. Our analytics solutions seek to help businesses deliver consistently high-quality digital experiences by connecting end-user experience and application performance to business outcomes. Our applications monitor, correlate, analyze, and act on application performance and business performance data in real time. This automated, cross-stack intelligence enables developers, IT operations, and business owners to make mission critical and strategic improvements. We continue to invest in IoT as the number of connected IoT devices continues to grow. Our Control Center Platform enables enterprises to automate the lifecycle of connected devices, including tools designed to automatically and remotely onboard, manage, and monetize their IoT devices. The Security product category primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management, advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products. Our offerings are powered by cloud-delivered threat intelligence based on our Cisco Talos technology. All of these products are  part  of  our  integrated  cybersecurity  architecture  that  is  designed  to  allow  our  customers  to  confront  risks  by  continuously  defending  against  threats  and verifying trust, across their environments. Regardless of size or industry, security continues to be a leading priority for our customers as they defend against ongoing ransomware and account breaches that represent risk of compromise and economic loss to their businesses. We  continue  to  integrate  security  across  our  portfolio  as  we  believe  our  security  solutions  can  help  build  a  foundation  of  trust  between  users,  devices,  and applications; across clouds, networks, and mobile workers. When targeted, our solutions help prevent attacks by continuously detecting and remediating the most advanced threats. In fiscal 2020, we continued to invest in cloud-delivered security and extended our security platform with the launch of SecureX. These investments included extending our zero-trust architecture with the on-going integration of Duo Security (“Duo”) and integrating Umbrella with our SD-WAN solutions to help secure our customer's network transformation toward a secure access service edge (SASE). Building on our integrated architecture, we launched SecureX, a security platform that brings together the breadth of the Cisco Security portfolio helping our customers accelerate responsiveness across the security lifecycle. Our Other Products category primarily consists of our cloud and system management and emerging technologies products. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers. Our overall service and support offerings are combined into one organization, Customer Experience, that is responsible for the end-to-end customer experience. Our support and maintenance services help our customers ensure their products operate efficiently, remain available, and benefit from the most up-to-date system, and application software. These services help customers protect their network investments, manage risk, and minimize downtime for systems running mission- critical applications. A key example is Cisco Smart Services, which leverages the intelligence from the installed base of our products and customer connections to protect  and  optimize  network  investment  for  our  customers  and  partners. We  have  expanded  these  offerings  from  traditional  hardware  support  to  software, solutions, and premium support. We also provide comprehensive advisory services that are focused on responsive, preventive, and consultative support of our technologies for specific networking needs. We are investing in and expanding advisory services in the areas of software, cloud, security, and analytics, which reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes. We are focused on three priorities including, utilizing technology advisory services to drive higher product and services; assessment and migration services providing the tools, expertise and methodologies to enable our customers to migrate to new technology platforms; and providing optimization services aligned with customers’ business expectations. Many factors influence the IT, collaboration, and networking requirements of our customers. These include the size of the organization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location, and business applications deployed throughout the customer’s network. Our customer base is not limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. In each of the past three fiscal years, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue. Our customers primarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector. Enterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically employ 1,000 or more employees. Many  enterprise  businesses  have  unique  IT,  collaboration,  and  networking  needs  within  a  multivendor  environment.  We  offer  service  and  support  packages, financing, and managed network services, primarily through our service provider partners. We sell these products through a network of third-party application and technology vendors and channel partners, as well as selling directly to these customers. We define commercial businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1,000 employees. We sell to the larger, or midmarket, customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less complexity. Small businesses, or organizations with fewer than 100 employees, require information technologies and communication products that are easy to configure, install, and maintain. We sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market primarily through channel partners. Service providers offer data, voice, video, and mobile/wireless services to businesses, governments, utilities, and consumers worldwide. This customer market category includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers, web-scale operators as well as Internet, cable, and wireless providers. We also include media, broadcast, and content providers within our service provider market, as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional network-based, content-based and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks. In addition, many  service  providers  use  Cisco  data  center,  virtualization,  and  collaboration  technologies  to  offer  managed  or  Internet-based  services  to  their  business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach. Public sector entities include federal governments, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public sector entities have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector entities through a network of third-party application and technology vendors, and channel partners, as well as through direct sales. As of the end of fiscal 2020, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 25,800 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We have field sales offices in 95 countries, and we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators. Distributors typically hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Starting in fiscal 2019, in connection with the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, we started recognizing revenue from two-tier distributors on a sell-in method. Prior to this, we recognized revenue based on a sell-through method using point of sales information provided by these distributors. These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. For information regarding risks related to our channels, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.” For information regarding risks relating to our international operations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain geopolitical environment;” “Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations;” “Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition;” “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency  exchange  rates  that  could  negatively  impact  our  financial  results  and  cash  flows;”  and  “Cyber-attacks,  data  breaches  or  malware  may  disrupt  our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation, and cyber-attacks or data breaches on our customers' networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business,” among others. Our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, technical, project, quality, and software maintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers. We provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. We believe customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business, particularly for those customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our financing arrangements include the following: The markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. Our growth strategy is based on the components of innovation, which we sometimes refer to as “build, buy, partner, invest, and co-develop”. This five-prong approach to how we innovate can be summarized as follows: We have acquired many companies, and we expect to make future acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky, especially if the acquired company has yet to generate revenue. No assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and technologies to an inability to do so. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.” We make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our products or that provide strategic value. The risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.” We  pursue  strategic  alliances  with  other  companies  in  areas  where  collaboration  can  produce  industry  advancement  and  acceleration  of  new  markets.  The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or new market creation. Companies with which we have added or expanded strategic alliances during fiscal 2020 and in recent years include Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon Web Services, among others. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase. The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.” We compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase.  Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product markets. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue. Our competitors (in each case relative to only some of our products or services) include: Amazon Web Services LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; CommScope Holding Company, Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace; F5 Networks, Inc.; FireEye, Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Lenovo Group Limited; LogMeIn, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Nutanix, Inc.; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Slack Technologies, Inc.; Ubiquiti Networks; VMware, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others. Some of these companies compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources,  including  technical  and  engineering  resources,  than  we  do.  As  we  expand  into  new  markets,  we  will  face  competition  not  only  from  our  existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other  areas,  and  in  our  view  this  trend  may  increase.  For  example,  the  enterprise  data  center  is  undergoing  a  fundamental  transformation  arising  from  the convergence  of  technologies,  including  computing,  networking,  storage,  and  software,  that  previously  were  segregated  within  the  data  center.  Due  to several factors,  including  the  availability  of  highly  scalable  and  general  purpose  microprocessors,  application-specific  integrated  circuits  (ASICs)  offering  advanced services, standards-based protocols, cloud computing, and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology, and suppliers from which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. Therefore, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and, accordingly affect our chances of success. We regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements  of our markets. We allocate our research and development  budget among our product categories, which consist of Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other Product technologies. Our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time. Recent areas of increased focus include our intent-based networking technologies (which encompasses switching, routing, and wireless technologies within Infrastructure Platforms), conferencing, security, and analytics products. Our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred. The  industry  in  which  we  compete  is  subject  to  rapid  technological  developments,  evolving  standards,  changes  in  customer  requirements,  and  new  product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our success depends in part upon our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of Internet working products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments, where appropriate, to provide us with access to new technologies. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve market acceptance. Manufacturing We rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of independent third-party companies to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 standards. Our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply; inventory management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-term contracts with any manufacturing service provider. We generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as-needed basis. These arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time. We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws. Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent  and  other  intellectual  property  rights.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  our  patents  and  other  proprietary  rights  will  not  be  challenged,  invalidated,  or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,” “We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others,” and “We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.” (1) Cost of sales includes manufacturing support, services, and training.

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND COULD IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally, including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. In the second half of fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our financial results and business operations, with a significant impact in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints. The magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain. These  disruptions  include  the  unprecedented  actions  taken  to  try  to  contain  the  pandemic  such  as  travel  bans  and  restrictions,  business  closures,  and  social distancing measures, such as quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including work-from-home and other policies implemented to protect  workers,  has  and  could  in  the  future  impact  our  supply  chain.  Vendors  may  be  under  pressure  to  allocate  product  to  certain  customers  for  business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. Such disruptions may continue, or worsen, in the future. In addition, current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, can also impact our ability to meet customer demand and could materially adversely affect us. Our customers have also experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, and increased collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with IT- Item 1A. Risk Factors related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs. The recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges. For example, governmental lockdowns, restrictions or new regulations has and could in the future impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work with the same speed and productivity in certain areas, even as other areas do not see negative impact. The extent and/or duration of ongoing workforce restrictions and limitations could impact our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, and hold product sales and marketing events to the extent we were able to previously. In addition, malefactors are seeking to use the COVID-19 pandemic to launch new cyber-attacks. See the risk factors below entitled “Cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation, and cyber-attacks or data breaches on our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business” and “Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.” The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  also  led  to  increased  disruption  and  volatility  in  capital  markets  and  credit  markets.  The  pandemic  and  resulting  economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the  economic  implications  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  on  our critical  and  significant  accounting  estimates.  The  actual  results  that  we experience  may  differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods. We are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. Potential negative impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and distribution channels; collectability  of  customer  accounts;  our ability  to  execute  strategic  plans;  impairments;  and  our profitability  and  cost  structure.  To  the  extent  the  COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section. Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment. These factors include: As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price. The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent, and is being significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2020, we continued to see a more broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. We  also  experienced  continuing  weakness  in  the  service  provider  market  and  emerging  countries,  and  we  expect  ongoing  uncertainty  in  these  markets. Additionally, instability in the global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical environment  in  many  parts  of  the  world  including  as  a  result  of  the  United  Kingdom  “Brexit”  withdrawal  from  the  European  Union,  the  current  economic challenges  in China, including global economic  ramifications  of Chinese economic  difficulties,  and other disruptions may continue  to put pressure  on global economic  conditions.  If  global  economic  and  market  conditions,  or  economic  conditions  in  key  markets,  remain  uncertain  or  deteriorate  further,  we  may experience material impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. For example, emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in product orders in fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods. In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers’ perception of the products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our operating results. We expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas, such as Security and Applications, while also focusing on maintaining leadership in Infrastructure Platforms and in Services. However, the return on our investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected. As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent  global  macroeconomic  environment,  the  significant  impacts  of the  COVID-19 pandemic,  and  related  market  uncertainty.  During  fiscal  2020, we continued to see a more broad-based  weakening in the global macroeconomic  environment  which impacted  our commercial  and enterprise  markets.  We also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did during fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing  issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns  result  in  periods  of  underutilized  capacity  and  periods  in  which  overtime  expenses  may  be  incurred,  as  well  as  in  potential  additional  inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter. The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter, primarily in the United States and in emerging countries. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. Inventory management remains an area of focus. We have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other  vendors  with  shorter  manufacturing  lead  times.  Such  multiple  ordering  (along  with  other  factors)  or  risk  of  order  cancellation  may  cause  difficulty  in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively. In addition, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance  may  result  in  more  variability  and  less  predictability  in  our  revenue  and  operating  results.  In  addition,  when  facing  component  supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments.  Increases  in  our  purchase  commitments  to  shorten  lead  times  could  also  lead  to  excess  and  obsolete  inventory  charges  if  the  demand  for  our products is less than our expectations. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results. Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods. Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales and sales of certain other Infrastructure Platforms and Applications products, in addition to longer sales cycles. Service provider product orders decreased during fiscal 2020 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of  time  given  fluctuating  market  conditions.  Sales  activity  in  this  industry  depends  upon  the  stage  of  completion  of  expanding  network  infrastructures;  the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and some of these or other conditions in the service provider market could affect our business and operating results in any future period. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers. If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. If sales through indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers. Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels. Although variability to date has not been significant, there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability. In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority and growth areas. For example, as products related to network programmability, such as software defined networking  (SDN)  products,  become  more  prevalent,  we  expect  to  face  increased  competition  from  companies  that  develop  networking  products  based  on commoditized hardware, referred to as “white box” hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from  competitors  in  Asia,  especially  from  China,  and  we  anticipate  this  will  continue.  For  information  regarding  our  competitors,  see  the  section  entitled “Competition” contained in Item 1. Business of this report. Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources,  including  technical  and  engineering  resources,  than  we  do.  As  we  expand  into  new  markets,  we  will  face  competition  not  only  from  our  existing competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase. For  example,  the  enterprise  data  center  is  undergoing  a  fundamental  transformation  arising  from  the  convergence  of  technologies,  including  computing, networking,  storage,  and  software,  that  previously  were  segregated.  Due  to  several  factors,  including  the  availability  of  highly  scalable  and  general  purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center  business  have  made  acquisitions,  or  announced  new  strategic  alliances,  designed  to  position  them  to  provide  end-to-end  technology  solutions  for  the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success. We must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations. Our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. When facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; a significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could decrease. We have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past. Although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See the risk factor above entitled “Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.” Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations. We may in the  future  experience  a  shortage  of  certain  component  parts  as  a  result  of  our  own  manufacturing  issues,  manufacturing  issues  at  our  suppliers  or  contract manufacturers,  capacity  problems  experienced  by  our  suppliers  or  contract  manufacturers  including  capacity  or  cost  problems  resulting  from  industry consolidation, or strong demand in the industry for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project  overall  component  demand  and  component  demands  within  specific  product  categories  and  to  establish  optimal  component  levels  and  manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales. Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. When facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments.  Increases  in  our  purchase  commitments  to  shorten  lead  times  could  also  lead  to  excess  and  obsolete  inventory  charges  if  the  demand  for  our products is less than our expectations. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. For additional information regarding our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed. The COVID-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with IT- related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs. The process of developing new technology, including intent-based networking, more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market  transitions—  such  as  security,  digital  transformation  and  IoT,  and  cloud—  is  complex  and  uncertain,  and  if  we  fail  to  accurately  predict  customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on “white box” hardware, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours. In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings. We have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new product and service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new products and services from those of our competitors,  and  market  acceptance  of  these  products  and  services.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  we  will  successfully  identify  new  product  and  services opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services  and technologies  developed  by others will not render our products, services or technologies  obsolete  or noncompetitive.  The products and technologies  in  our  other  product  categories  and  key  priority  and  growth  areas  may  not  prove  to  have  the  market  success  we  anticipate,  and  we  may  not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special  charges,  such  as  inventory  and  technology-related  write-offs,  workforce  reduction  or  restructuring  costs,  charges  relating  to  consolidation  of  excess facilities, or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings. We initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which includes a voluntary early retirement program. The implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive  to our business, and following completion  of the restructuring  plan our business may not be more efficient  or effective  than prior to implementation of the plan. Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. While  we  intend  to  focus  on  managing  our  costs  and  expenses,  over  the  long  term,  we  also  intend  to invest  in  personnel  and  other  resources  related  to  our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority and growth areas, such as Security and Applications, and we  also  intend  to  focus  on  maintaining  leadership  in  Infrastructure  Platforms  and  in  Services.  We  are  likely  to  recognize  the  costs  associated  with  these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected. A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the Internet, including the continued development of the Internet and the anticipated market transitions, and on the deployment of our products by customers who depend on such continued growth and evolution. To the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on Internet infrastructure, including spending or investment related to anticipated market transitions, we could experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition. Because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost-effectiveness and security, we believe that there could be performance problems with Internet communications in the future, which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. Because we are a large supplier of networking products, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these problems are due to the performance of our own products. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business. Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage  and  successfully  integrate  acquisitions  could  materially  harm  our  business  and  operating  results.  Prior  acquisitions  have  resulted  in  a  wide  range  of outcomes,  from  successful  introduction  of  new  products  and  technologies  to  a  failure  to  do  so. Even  when an  acquired  company  has  already  developed  and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks related to new product development also apply  to  acquisitions.  See  the  risk  factors  above,  including  the  risk  factor  entitled  “We  depend  upon  the  development  of  new  products  and  services,  and enhancements  to  existing  products  and  services,  and  if  we  fail  to  predict  and  respond  to  emerging  technological  trends  and  customers’  changing  needs,  our operating results and market share may suffer” for additional information. As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. Several of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further,  entry  into  other  markets  has  subjected  and  will  subject  us  to  additional  risks,  particularly  to  those  markets,  including  the  effects  of  general  market conditions  and  reduced  consumer  confidence.  For  example,  as  we  add  direct  selling  capabilities  globally  to  meet  changing  customer  demands,  we  will  face increased legal and regulatory requirements. There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. For example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants. We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in future periods of a widely-used component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products, and in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such, our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging  countries.  We  also  depend  on  non-U.S.  operations  of  our  contract  manufacturers,  component  suppliers  and  distribution  partners.  Our  business  in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. Our future results could be materially  adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and outside the United States, including impacts  from  global  central  bank  monetary  policy;  issues  related  to  the  political  relationship  between  the  United  States  and  other  countries  that  can  affect regulatory matters, affect the willingness of customers in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States or affect our ability  to  procure  components  if  a  government  body  were  to  deny  us  access  to  those  components;  government-related  disruptions  or  shutdowns;  and  the challenging Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. We monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. We believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant infrastructure projects. Our loan  financing  arrangements  may  include  not  only  financing  the  acquisition  of  our  products  and  services  but  also  providing  additional  funds  for  other  costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn  or  periods  of  economic  uncertainty.  Although  we  have  programs  in  place  that  are  designed  to  monitor  and  mitigate  the  associated  risk,  including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks. In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A portion of our sales is derived through our distributors. These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. We maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms. However, distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk, because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investments below their cost basis. Our non-marketable equity and other investments are subject  to  risk  of  loss  of  investment  capital.  These  investments  are  inherently  risky  because  the  markets  for  the  technologies  or  products  they  have  under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar-denominated sales in Japan, Canada, and Australia and certain nondollar-denominated operating expenses and service cost of sales in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, where we sell primarily in U.S. dollars. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies. We  enter  into  foreign  exchange  forward  contracts  and  options  to  reduce  the  short-term  impact  of  foreign  currency  fluctuations  on  certain  foreign  currency receivables, investments, and payables. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that have enabled us to be successful. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because  of  the  potential  for  high  court  awards  that  are  not  necessarily  predictable,  it  is  not  unusual  to  find  even  arguably  unmeritorious  claims  settled  for significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a customer  with  respect  to  a  claim  against  the  customer,  or  if  we  fail  to  develop  non-infringing  technology  or  license  the  proprietary  rights  on  commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. For additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development  process  with  respect  to  such  technology  or  the  care  taken  to  safeguard  against  infringement  risks.  Further,  in  the  past,  third  parties  have  made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit versions of our products. While we work  diligently  with  law enforcement  authorities  in  various  countries  to  block  the  manufacture  of  counterfeit  goods  and  to  interdict  their  sale,  and  to  detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results. Currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the Internet. We could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include matters such as voice over the Internet or using IP, encryption technology, sales or other taxes on Internet product or service sales, and access charges for Internet service providers. The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate, in the United States or other countries could affect the sales of our products. In particular, we believe that there may be future changes in U.S. telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including “net neutrality” rules to the extent they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure. Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect the sales of our products for certain  classes  of  customers.  Additionally,  in  the  United  States,  our  products  must  comply  with  various  requirements  and  regulations  of  the  Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory authorities. In countries outside of the United States, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry authorities. Changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California. Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long- term contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes  to  our  overall  compensation  program,  including  our  stock  incentive  program,  resulting  from  the  management  of  share  dilution  and  share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. As a result of one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. In addition, companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future. We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. For example, Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total remaining asserted claims by Brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to $155 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $756 million for interest, and $383 million for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of July 25, 2020. We have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material  adverse effect  on our business, operating results, or financial condition. For additional information  regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.” Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated  in countries that have higher tax rates;  by changes in the valuation of our deferred  tax assets and liabilities;  by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign  income,  and  the  foreign  tax  credit  rules.  Significant  judgment  is  required  to  determine  the  recognition  and  measurement  attribute  prescribed  in  the accounting  guidance  for  uncertainty  in  income  taxes.  The  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD),  an  international  association comprised of 37 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. Also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, volcano, or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Despite our implementation of security measures, the products and services we sell to customers, and our servers, data centers and the cloud-based solutions on which  our  data,  and  data  of  our  customers,  suppliers  and  business  partners  are  stored,  are  vulnerable  to  cyber-attacks,  data  breaches,  malware,  and  similar disruptions  from  unauthorized  access  or  tampering  by  malicious  actors  or  inadvertent  error.  Any  such  event  could  compromise  our  products,  services,  and networks or those of our customers, and the information stored on our systems or those of our customers could be improperly accessed, processed, disclosed, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, give rise to legal/regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and may cause damage to our reputation. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance, and may not be successful. Breaches of security in our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business. The products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We may also make prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix, and the timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit which compromises security. Customers also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation. In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based service and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities. Customers may also not deploy a security release, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products, services or cloud-based solutions containing the release, leaving them vulnerable. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business. The  continued  threat  of  terrorism  and  heightened  security  and  military  action  in  response  to  this  threat,  or  any  future  acts  of  terrorism,  may  cause  further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Likewise, events such as loss of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer complementary products and services and  in  the  past  have  established  a  joint  venture  to  market  services  associated  with  our  Cisco  Unified  Computing  System  products.  These  arrangements  are generally  limited  to  specific  projects,  the  goal  of  which  is  generally  to  facilitate  product  compatibility  and  adoption  of  industry  standards.  There  can  be  no assurance we will realize the expected benefits  from  these  strategic  alliances  or  from  the  joint  venture.  If  successful,  these  relationships  may  be  mutually  beneficial  and  result  in  industry  growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate  with that company in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize  as expected,  we could suffer  delays in product development  or other operational  difficulties.  Joint ventures can  be difficult  to manage,  given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners. Historically,  our  common  stock  has  experienced  substantial  price  volatility,  particularly  as  a  result  of  variations  between  our  actual  financial  results  and  the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors, as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors, may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. Additionally, volatility, lack of positive performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance of our stock price. As of the end of fiscal 2020, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $14.5 billion that mature at specific dates from calendar year 2021 through 2040. We have also established a commercial paper program under which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $10.0 billion, and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of July 25, 2020. The outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixed-rate interest payable semiannually. The fair value of the long-term debt is subject to market interest rate volatility. The instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain covenants applicable to us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, we will be required to have available in the United States sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity. There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources. Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances. None. Our corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in San Jose, California, in the United States of America. The locations of our headquarters by geographic segment are as follows: For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, see Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies - (f) Legal Proceedings” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference. Not applicable. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Item 2. Properties Item 3. Legal Proceedings Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures In  addition  to  our  headquarters  site,  we  own  additional  sites  in  the  United  States,  which  include  facilities  in  the  surrounding  areas  of  San  Jose,  California; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Richardson, Texas; Lawrenceville, Georgia; and Boxborough, Massachusetts. We also own land for expansion in some of these locations. In addition, we lease office space in many U.S. locations. Outside the United States our operations are conducted primarily in leased sites. Other significant sites (in addition to the two non-U.S. headquarters locations) are located in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Poland, and the United Kingdom. We believe that our existing facilities, including both owned and leased, are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business. San Jose, California, USA   Amsterdam, Netherlands   Singapore Americas   EMEA   APJC On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. As of July 25, 2020, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $10.8 billion with no termination date. For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (a) Cisco common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CSCO. Information regarding quarterly cash dividends declared on Cisco’s common stock during fiscal 2020 and 2019 may be found in Supplementary Financial Data on page 104 of this report. There were 37,920 registered shareholders as of August 28, 2020. (b) None. (c) Issuer purchases of equity securities (in millions, except per-share amounts): The information contained in this Stock Performance Graph section shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material” or “filed” or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that Cisco specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The following graph shows a five-year comparison of the cumulative total shareholder return on Cisco common stock with the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 Index, and the S&P Information Technology Index. The graph tracks the performance of a $100 investment in the Company’s common stock and in each of the indexes (with the reinvestment of all dividends) on the date specified. Shareholder returns over the indicated period are based on historical data and should not be considered indicative of future shareholder returns.

As a result, revenue from the SPVSS business did not recur in future periods. Revenue for the years ended July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018 include SPVSS revenue of $168 million and $903 million, respectively. (2)  In connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”), we recorded an $872 million charge which was the reversal of the previously recorded benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018 as a result of a retroactive final U.S. Treasury regulation issued during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. (3)  In fiscal 2018, Cisco recorded a provisional tax expense of $10.4 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Act comprised of $8.1 billion of U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion re-measurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities (DTA). (4) In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Cisco completed the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. As a result, revenue from this portion of the Service Provider Video product category did not recur in future periods. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $253 million net of certain transaction costs. The year ended July 30, 2016 includes SP Video CPE Business revenue of $504 million. (5) In fiscal 2016 Cisco recognized total tax benefits of $593 million for the following: i) the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Cisco settled all outstanding items related to Cisco’s federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010, as a result of which Cisco recorded a net tax benefit of $367 million; and  ii)  the  Protecting  Americans  from  Tax  Hikes  Act  of  2015  reinstated  the  U.S.  federal  R&D  tax  credit  permanently,  as  a  result  of  which  Cisco recognized tax benefits of $226 million. At the beginning of fiscal 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, using the modified retrospective method to those contracts that were not completed as of July 28, 2018.

We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. Cisco  designs  and  sells  a  broad  range  of  technologies  that  have  been  powering  the  Internet  since  1984.  We  are  integrating  intent-based  technologies  across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud. These technologies are designed to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks. This will enable us to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business. (1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of our SPVSS business. As a result, revenue from this business will not recur in future periods. Includes SPVSS business revenue of $168 million for fiscal 2019. (2) Includes a $0.9 billion charge for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2019 related to the Tax Act. Item 7.

Total revenue decreased by 5% compared with fiscal 2019. Our product revenue declined in Infrastructure Platforms and Applications, partially offset by growth in Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business model to increased software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. We saw broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment during the fiscal year which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. We also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets. While the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased 8% and service revenue increased by 3%. Total gross margin increased by 1.4 percentage points, driven primarily by productivity benefits and product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 0.8 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.2 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 1%, driven by a decrease in diluted share count of 199 million shares, partially offset by a decrease in net income of 4%. In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $1.6 billion, driven in large part by a product revenue decline in the United States. EMEA revenue decreased by $0.4 billion and revenue in our APJC segment decreased by $0.5 billion. The “BRICM” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 25% in the aggregate, driven by decreased product revenue in the emerging countries of India, China, Mexico and Brazil. From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue declines across all customer segments, with the most significant declines in the commercial and service provider markets. During fiscal 2020, we saw a decline in business momentum in the commercial and enterprise markets, which we believe was significantly related to weakness in the global macroeconomic environment. From  a  product  category  perspective,  total  product  revenue  decreased 8% year  over  year.  The  decrease  was  driven  by  declines  in  revenue  in  Infrastructure Platforms and Applications of 10% and 4%, respectively. These declines were partially offset by a product revenue increase in Security of 12%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, total revenue decreased by 9%. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 13% and service revenue was flat. With regard to our geographic segment performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas, EMEA and APJC decreased by 12%, 6% and 7% respectively. From a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue declines in Infrastructure Platforms and Applications, offset by growth in Security. Total gross margin decreased by 0.7 percentage points, driven by unfavorable pricing partially offset by favorable product mix. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively decreased by 0.6 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 22% and net income increased by 19%. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 included a $0.9 billion tax charge related to the Tax Act. During this extraordinary time, our priority has been supporting our employees, customers, partners and communities, while positioning Cisco for the future. The pandemic  has  driven  organizations  across  the  globe  to  digitize  their  operations  and  support  remote  workforces  at  a  faster  speed  and  greater  scale  than  ever before. We remain focused on providing the technology and solutions our customers need to accelerate their digital organizations. The actions we are taking include: As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud environment, the network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace and our mission is to inspire new possibilities for them by helping transform their infrastructure, expand applications and analytics, address their security needs, and empower their teams. We believe that our customers are looking for intent-based networks that provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments. Our vision is to deliver highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms for our customers. For a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see “Item 1. Business.” Other Key Financial Measures The following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 (in millions):     Fiscal 2020   Fiscal 2019 Cash and cash equivalents and investments   $29,419   $33,413 Cash provided by operating activities   $15,426   $15,831 Deferred revenue   $20,446   $18,467 Repurchases of common stock—stock repurchase program   $2,619   $20,577 Dividends   $6,016   $5,979 Inventories   $1,282   $1,383 • Most of our global workforce working from home. • Seamless  transition  to  work  from  home  with  a  long-standing  flexible  work  policy,  and  we  build  the  technologies  that  allow  organizations  to  stay connected, secure and productive. • For  the  remainder  who  must  be  in  the  office  to  perform  their  roles,  we  are  focused  on  their  health  and  safety,  and  are  taking  all  of  the  necessary precautions. • Introduced a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted entire workforces to be remote. • Announced a Cisco Capital Business Resiliency Program leveraging currently available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions to offer  financial  flexibility  and support  business  continuity.  This will  help  customers  and  partners  access  the  technology  they  need  now,  invest  for recovery, and defer most of the payments until early 2021. • Committed significant funds to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. • Providing technology and financial support for non-profits, first responders, and governments. • Donating personal protective equipment to hospital workers including N95 masks and face shields 3D-printed by Cisco volunteers around the world. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Note  2  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting  policies  described  below  are  significantly  affected  by  critical  accounting  estimates.  Such  accounting  policies  require  significant  judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. The  inputs  into  certain  of  our  judgments,  assumptions  and  estimates  considered  the  economic  implications  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  critical  and significant  accounting  estimates.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  our  significant  judgments,  assumptions  and  estimates  that  are reflected in our results for fiscal 2020. These estimates include: goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods. We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance  obligations.  As a  result,  our contracts  may  contain  multiple  performance  obligations.  We  determine  whether  arrangements  are  distinct  based  on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer  the product or service  to  the customer  is separately  identifiable  from other obligations  in the contract.  We classify  our hardware,  perpetual  software licenses,  and  SaaS  as  distinct  performance  obligations.  Term  software  licenses  represent  multiple  obligations,  which  include  software  licenses  and  software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer  receives  the  benefit  over  the  contract  term.  Our  hardware  and  perpetual  software  licenses  are  distinct  performance  obligations  where  revenue  is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized  ratably over the contract  term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes. Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our  distributors,  channel  partners  and  customers.  When  determining  the  amount  of  revenue  to  recognize,  we  estimate  the  expected  usage  of  these  programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2020, the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $72.8 billion for the Americas, $51.6 billion for EMEA, and $31.3 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We  make  judgments  about  the  recoverability  of  purchased  intangible  assets  with  finite  lives  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing deductions, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements,  nondeductible  compensation,  international  realignments,  and transfer  pricing adjustments. Our effective  tax rate was 19.7%, 20.2%, and 99.2% in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. During  fiscal  2018  and  fiscal  2019,  we  recorded  a  total  tax  charge  of  $11.3  billion,  consisting  of  $9  billion  of  tax  expense  for  the  U.S.  transition  tax  on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion of tax expense for DTA re-measurement as a result of the Tax Act. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated  in countries that have higher tax rates;  by changes in the valuation of our deferred  tax assets and liabilities;  by changes to domestic  manufacturing  deduction,  foreign-derived  intangible  income  deduction,  global  intangible  low-tax  income  and  base  erosion  and  anti-abuse  tax  laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 37 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2019, filed with the SEC on September 5, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.cisco.com. (1) Total revenue and product revenue not including the SPVSS business in the prior year decreased 5% and 7%, respectively. Service revenue not including the SPVSS business in the prior year increased 3%. We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our revenue, which includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Total revenue in fiscal 2020 decreased by 5% compared with fiscal 2019. Product revenue decreased by 8% and service revenue increased by 3%. Our total revenue reflected declines across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the emerging countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 25% product revenue decline, with decreases in India, China, Mexico and Brazil. In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment.

Americas Product revenue in the Americas segment decreased by 8%. The product revenue decrease was across all of our customer segments. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 7% in the United States, 13% in Canada, 27% in Mexico and 14% in Brazil. The decrease in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 6% was driven by declines in the service provider, commercial and enterprise markets, partially offset by growth in the public sector market. Product revenue from emerging countries within EMEA decreased by 4%, and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in Western Europe, decreased by 6%. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased in the United Kingdom and France by 12% and 7%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue increase of 2% in Germany. Product revenue in the APJC segment decreased by 11%, driven by declines across all of our customer segments. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased in Australia, India and China by 16%, 29% and 34%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue increase of 8% in Japan.

We report our product revenue in the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other Products. This aligns our product categories with our evolving business model. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Infrastructure Platforms The Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless, and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue decreased by 10%, or $3.0 billion. This was the product area most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic environment in the second half of fiscal 2020. Switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, although we had revenue growth in our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series. We experienced a decrease in sales of routing products, with declines primarily in the service provider and enterprise markets. Revenue from wireless products declined, although we saw revenue growth in our Meraki and WiFi6 products. Revenue from data center declined driven by continued market contraction impacting primarily our servers products. Applications The  Applications  product  category  includes  our  collaboration  offerings  (unified  communications,  Cisco  TelePresence  and  conferencing)  as  well  as  IoT  and AppDynamics  analytics  software  offerings.  Revenue  in  our  Applications  product  category  decreased  by 4%,  or $235  million,  with  a  decline  in  Unified Communications and Cisco TelePresence partially offset by double digit growth in AppDynamics and growth in IoT software offerings and Webex. Security Revenue in our Security product category increased 12%, or $333 million, driven by higher sales of identity and access, advanced threat security, unified threat management and web security products. Revenue from our cloud security portfolio reflected strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. Other Products The decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from the SPVSS business which we divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

Service revenue increased 3%, driven by an increase in software and solution support offerings. Service revenue increased in all geographic segments. (1) Productivity includes overall manufacturing-related costs, such as component costs, warranty expense, provision for inventory, freight, logistics, shipment volume, and other items not categorized elsewhere. Product gross margin increased by 1.4 percentage points driven by productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing. In the second half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we incurred additional logistics costs, such as freight which had a negative impact on product gross margin. Our product gross margin benefited slightly from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Productivity improvements were driven by memory cost savings and other cost reductions including value engineering efforts (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational efficiency Years Ended   2020 vs. 2019 Years Ended July 25, 2020   July 27, 2019   July 28, 2018  Variance in Dollars   Variance in Percent Service revenue: Fiscal 2019   61.9 % Productivity (1)   1.9 % Product pricing   (1.3)% Mix of products sold   0.9 % Impact from divestiture of SPVSS business   0.1 % Others   (0.2)% Fiscal 2020   63.3 % Americas $ 8,285  $ 8,173  $ 7,982  $ 112   1% Percentage of service revenue 62.2%   63.4%   63.3%       EMEA 3,012   2,854   2,754   158   6% Percentage of service revenue 22.6%   22.1%   21.8%       APJC 2,026   1,872   1,885   154   8% Percentage of service revenue 15.2%   14.5%   14.9%       Total $ 13,323  $ 12,899  $ 12,621  $ 424   3% Product $ 22,779  $ 24,142  $ 22,282   63.3%   61.9%   60.7% Service 8,904   8,524   8,324   66.8%   66.1%   66.0% Total $ 31,683  $ 32,666  $ 30,606   64.3%   62.9%   62.0% in manufacturing operations. The negative pricing impact, which was higher than the year-over-year impact we experienced in fiscal 2019, was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments. The favorable product mix impact was driven by impacts from each of our product categories. Service Gross Margin Our service gross margin percentage increased by 0.7 percentage point primarily due to higher sales volume. Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business. Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the gross margin from technical support services. (1) The  unallocated  corporate  items include  the  effects  of  amortization  and  impairments  of  acquisition-related  intangible  assets,  share-based  compensation  expense,  significant  litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. Product gross margin in our EMEA segment increased due to productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. The APJC segment gross margin percentage increase was due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. Higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the gross margin in this geographic segment. The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or may not be indicative of a trend for that segment.

We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower discretionary spending and contracted services spending. G&A Expenses G&A expenses increased due to the benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista Networks, Inc. (“Arista”) in fiscal 2019 and higher discretionary spending, partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of property that had been held for sale, lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services spending, and lower share-based compensation expense. In fiscal 2020, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $141 million, or 0.8%, compared with fiscal 2019. The increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets was due largely to the amortization of purchased intangibles from our recent acquisitions.

The total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately $900 million. We expect the plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021 and estimate it will generate cost savings of approximately $1.0 billion on an annualized basis over the next few quarters. We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2020 in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges  of  approximately $300  million.  In  connection  with  this  restructuring  plan,  we  incurred  charges  of $255  million during fiscal  2020.  We  expect  this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021. We incurred total restructuring and other charges of $481 million in fiscal 2020. We incurred charges of $255 million related to the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2020 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced during fiscal 2018. These charges were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas. As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods. Operating income decreased by 4%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 0.2 percentage points. These changes resulted primarily from: a revenue decrease, the impact of the benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and higher restructuring and other charges, partially offset by a gross margin percentage increase (driven by productivity improvements and product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing). Interest income decreased driven by a lower average balance of cash and available-for-sale debt investments and lower interest rates. The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance and the impact of lower effective interest rates.

The change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable equity and other investments was primarily due to higher realized gains and higher unrealized gains, partially offset by higher impairment charges. The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by higher donation expense as related to COVID-19 programs, partially offset by net favorable foreign exchange impacts. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.7% for fiscal 2020, compared with 20.2% for fiscal 2019. The net 0.5 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in net discrete tax charges. For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Years Ended   2020 vs. 2019   July 25, 2020   July 27, 2019   July 28, 2018   Variance in Dollars Gains (losses) on investments, net: The following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheet, our capital allocation strategy including stock repurchase program and dividends, our contractual obligations, and certain other commitments and activities on our liquidity and capital resources. The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by a net decrease in debt of $10.2 billion, cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $2.7 billion under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.0 billion, capital expenditures of $0.8 billion and net cash paid for acquisitions  and divestitures  of $0.3 billion. These uses of cash were  partially  offset  by cash provided by operating activities of $15.4 billion. In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, on July 9, 2019 we announced our intent to acquire Acacia Communications, Inc. for a net purchase consideration of approximately $2.6 billion in cash. Additionally, approximately $0.7 billion of the U.S. transition tax on accumulated  earnings for foreign subsidiaries and $3.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding at July 25, 2020 will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. See further discussion of liquidity and future payments under “Contractual Obligations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position is critical at this time of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments. These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions): We expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, the rate at which products are shipped during the quarter (which we refer to as shipment linearity), the timing and collection of accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory and supply chain management, deferred revenue and the timing and amount of tax and other payments. For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report. We  consider  free  cash  flow  to  be  a  liquidity  measure  that  provides  useful  information  to  management  and  investors  because  of  our  intent  to  return  a  stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do. Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $10.8 billion, with no termination date. Accounts Receivable, Net  The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): Our accounts receivable net, as of July 25, 2020 was flat compared with the end of fiscal 2019. Inventory Supply Chain  The following table summarizes our inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers (in millions): Inventory as of July 25, 2020 decreased by 7% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2019, and for the same period purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 11%. On a combined basis, inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 10% compared with the end of fiscal 2019. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to a decrease in finished goods and lower deferred cost of sales, partially offset by an increase in raw materials. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course  of  business,  in  order  to  manage  manufacturing  lead  times  and  help  ensure  adequate  component  supply,  we  enter  into  agreements  with  contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing manufacturing capacity. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current demand forecasts. July 25, 2020  $ 1.42  $ 6,016   59  $ 44.36  $ 2,619  $ 8,635 July 27, 2019  $ 1.36  $ 5,979   418  $ 49.22  $ 20,577  $ 26,556 July 28, 2018  $ 1.24  $ 5,968   432  $ 40.88  $ 17,661  $ 23,629 Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels. Financing  Receivables  Our  financing  arrangements  include  leases,  loans,  and  financed  service  contracts.  Lease  receivables  include  sales-type  leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products  and  services.  We  also  provide  financing  to  certain  qualified  customers  for  long-term  service  contracts,  which  primarily  relate  to  technical  support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 7%. Financing Guarantees  In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. During fiscal 2020, we expanded the payment terms on certain of our channel partner financing programs by 30 days in response to the COVID-19 pandemic environment. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The  volume  of  channel  partner  financing  was $26.9  billion, $29.6  billion,  and $28.2  billion in fiscal  2020,  2019,  and  2018,  respectively.  These  financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively. We could be called upon to make  payments  under  these  guarantees  in  the  event  of  nonpayment  by  the  channel  partners  or  end-user  customers.  Historically,  our  payments  under  these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July 25, 2020, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $207 million, of which approximately $28 million was recorded as deferred revenue. COVID-19 Business Resiliency Program At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we initiated a new Business Resiliency Program designed to help customers and channel partners mitigate financial challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This program includes $2.5 billion in currently available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions. The new Business Resiliency Program offered by us includes an up-front 90-day payment holiday and allows a customer to defer 95 percent of the payments for a new product or solution until calendar 2021, which in turn protects their business and increases their existing cash flow. Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 25, 2020. Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 25, 2020. We had $4.2 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 27, 2019. Credit Facility On May 15, 2020, we entered into a 364-day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 14, 2021. The credit agreement is structured as an amendment and restatement of our five-year credit facility which would have terminated on May 15, 2020, the end of its five-year term. As of July 25, 2020, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than 0.25%. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then- existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion. This credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. Fixed-rate notes:         Three-month LIBOR plus 0.34% September 20, 2019  $ —  $ 500 1.40% September 20, 2019   —   1,500 4.45% January 15, 2020   —   2,500 2.45% June 15, 2020   —   1,500 2.20% February 28, 2021   2,500   2,500 2.90% March 4, 2021   500   500 1.85% September 20, 2021   2,000   2,000 3.00% June 15, 2022   500   500 2.60% February 28, 2023   500   500 2.20% September 20, 2023   750   750 3.625% March 4, 2024   1,000   1,000 3.50% June 15, 2025   500   500 2.95% February 28, 2026   750   750 2.50% September 20, 2026   1,500   1,500 5.90% February 15, 2039   2,000   2,000 5.50% January 15, 2040   2,000   2,000 Total    $ 14,500  $ 20,500 Total deferred revenue increased 11% in fiscal 2020. The increase in deferred product revenue of 17% was primarily due to increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. The increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue. Total  remaining  performance  obligations  increased 12% in fiscal  2020.  Remaining  performance  obligations  for  product  and  service  increased 17% and 9%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2019. The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at July 25, 2020 (in millions): Operating Leases  For more information on our operating leases, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers  We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” Other Purchase Obligations  Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt  The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Transition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Act. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Long-Term Liabilities  Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax  liabilities,  and  certain  other  long-term  liabilities.  Due  to  the  uncertainty  in  the  timing  of  future  payments,  our  noncurrent  income  taxes  payable  of approximately  $1.9 billion and deferred  tax liabilities  of $81 million were  presented  as one  aggregated  amount  in the  total  column  on a  separate  line  in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Commitments In  connection  with  our  acquisitions,  we  have  agreed  to  pay  certain  additional  amounts  contingent  upon  the  achievement  of  certain  agreed-upon  technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $0.3 billion as of each of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary course of business, we have non- marketable equity and other investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 25, 2020 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities. On an ongoing basis, we reassess our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing Receivables and Guarantees.” While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the following: working  capital  needs,  capital  expenditures,  investment  requirements,  stock  repurchases,  cash  dividends,  contractual  obligations,  commitments,  principal  and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions,  arrangements,  or  relationships  with  unconsolidated  entities  or  other  persons  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect  the  liquidity  and  the availability of, as well as our requirements for, capital resources. Our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency exchange risk. We have seen an increase in these risks and related uncertainties with increased volatility in the financial markets in the current environment with the COVID-19 pandemic. Available-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our primary objective for holding available- for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates as has also happened recently, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our available-for-sale debt investments as of July 25, 2020. Our available-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not leveraged as of July 25, 2020. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments, including the hedging effects when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS. The hypothetical fair values as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019 are as follows (in millions): Financing Receivables As of July 25, 2020, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $10.8 billion, compared with $10.1 billion as of July 27, 2019. As of July 25, 2020, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 25, 2020, we had $14.5 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding. The carrying amount of the senior notes was $14.6 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $17.4 billion. As of July 25, 2020, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding the $2.5 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.5 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged. Marketable Equity Investments The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held for purposes other than trading. We had no outstanding marketable equity securities as of July 25, 2020. Non-marketable Equity and Other Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of July 25, 2020, the total carrying amount of our non-marketable equity and other investments was $1.3 billion, compared with $1.2 billion at July 27, 2019. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of non-marketable  equity  and  other  investments  is  based  on  the  fundamentals  of  the  businesses  invested  in,  including,  among  other  factors,  the  nature  of  their technologies and potential for financial return. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows (in millions): At July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, we had no option contracts outstanding. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2020, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $141 million, or 0.8%, as compared with fiscal 2019. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales. We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Cisco Systems, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cisco Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 25, 2020, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended July 25, 2020 appearing under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of July 25, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended July 25, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 25, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2020 and the manner in which it accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in 2019. The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  included  in  the  accompanying  Management’s  Report  on  Internal  Control  over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial  reporting  based  on  our  audits.  We  are  a  public  accounting  firm  registered  with  the  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (United  States) (PCAOB)  and  are  required  to  be  independent  with  respect  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.  federal  securities  laws  and  the  applicable  rules  and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our  audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting  included  obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of the  company;  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or timely  detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue recognition — identification of contractual terms in certain customer arrangements As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, management assesses relevant contractual terms in its customer arrangements to determine the transaction price and recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of the promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects  to receive  in  exchange  for  those  products  or  services.  Management  applies  judgment  in  determining  the  transaction  price  which is  dependent  on  the contractual terms. In order to determine the transaction price, management may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount and timing of revenue recognition. The  principal  considerations  for  our  determination  that  performing  procedures  relating  to  the  identification  of  contractual  terms  in  customer  arrangements  to determine the transaction price is a critical audit matter are there was significant judgment by management in identifying contractual terms due to the volume and customized nature of the Company’s customer arrangements. This in turn led to significant effort in performing our audit procedures which were designed to evaluate whether the contractual terms used in the determination of the transaction price and the timing of revenue recognition were appropriately identified and determined by management and to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including those related to the identification of contractual terms in customer arrangements that impact the determination of the transaction price and revenue recognition. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s identification of the contractual terms by examining customer arrangements on a test basis, and (ii) testing management’s process for determining the appropriate amount and timing of revenue recognition based on the contractual terms identified in the customer arrangements. We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1988. Cisco’s management has always assumed full accountability for maintaining compliance with our established financial accounting policies and for reporting our results with objectivity and the highest degree of integrity. It is critical for investors and other users of the Consolidated Financial Statements to have confidence that  the  financial  information  that  we  provide  is  timely,  complete,  relevant,  and  accurate.  Management  is  responsible  for  the  fair  presentation  of  Cisco’s Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America,  and  has  full responsibility for their integrity and accuracy. Management, with oversight by Cisco’s Board of Directors, has established and maintains a strong ethical climate so that our affairs are conducted to the highest standards  of  personal  and  corporate  conduct.  Management  also  has  established  an  effective  system  of  internal  controls.  Cisco’s  policies  and  practices  reflect corporate governance initiatives that are compliant with the listing requirements of Nasdaq and the corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We are committed to enhancing shareholder value and fully understand and embrace our fiduciary oversight responsibilities. We are dedicated to ensuring that our high standards of financial accounting and reporting, as well as our underlying system of internal controls, are maintained. Our culture demands integrity, and we have the highest confidence in our processes, our internal controls and our people, who are objective in their responsibilities and who operate under the highest level of ethical standards. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Cisco. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  Company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  Company;  and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management  (with  the  participation  of the  principal  executive  officer  and  principal  financial  officer)  conducted  an evaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of Cisco’s internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  the  framework  in Internal  Control—Integrated  Framework (2013)  issued  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that Cisco’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of July 25, 2020. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of Cisco’s internal control over financial reporting and has issued a report on Cisco’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in their report on the preceding pages. /S/ CHARLES H.

Basis of Presentation The fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cisco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 were each 52-week fiscal years. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of ours and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC). Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments, if any, are presented as a separate component from our equity in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The share of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation. We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Cash and Cash Equivalents   We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various financial institutions. (b) Available-for-Sale Debt Investments   We classify our investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt investments. Our available-for-sale debt investments primarily consist of U.S. government, U.S. government agency, corporate debt, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available- for-sale debt investments sold. These investments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on these investments, to the extent the investments are unhedged, are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax. We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. (d) Impairments of Investments   When the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, it is deemed impaired, and we will assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (i) or (ii) described earlier, the entire difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of the debt security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit losses (defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security) will be recognized in earnings, and the amount relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). We hold non-marketable equity and other investments which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor these investments for impairments and make reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. • Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value through income. • Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. For certain of these securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value of these investments. • Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to exert significant influence over the investee. These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. (e) Inventories   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We provide inventory write-downs based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. The write-down is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances  do  not  result  in  the  restoration  or  increase  in  that  newly  established  cost  basis.  In  addition,  we  record  a  liability  for  firm,  noncancelable,  and unconditional  purchase  commitments  with  contract  manufacturers  and  suppliers  for  quantities  in  excess  of  our  future  demand  forecasts  consistent  with  our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. (f) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts. We regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, and expected default frequency rates. Trade receivables are written off at the point when they are considered uncollectible. (g) Financing Receivables and Guarantees   We provide financing arrangements, including leases, financed service contracts, and loans, for certain qualified end- user customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. Lease receivables primarily represent sales-type and direct-financing leases. Leases have on average a four-year term and are usually collateralized  by a security interest in the underlying assets. Loan receivables  include customers financing purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Loan receivables have terms of three years on average. Financed service contracts typically have terms of one to three years and primarily relate to technical support services. We determine the adequacy of our allowance for credit loss by assessing the risks and losses inherent in our financing receivables by portfolio segment. The portfolio segment is based on the types of financing offered by us to our customers: lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts. We assess the allowance for credit loss related to financing receivables on either an individual or a collective basis. We consider various factors in evaluating lease and loan receivables and the earned portion of financed service contracts for possible impairment on an individual basis. These factors include our historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When the evaluation indicates that it is probable that all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the financing agreement, including scheduled interest payments, are unable to be collected, the financing receivable is considered impaired. All such outstanding amounts, including any accrued interest, are assessed and reserved at the customer level. Our internal credit risk ratings are categorized as 1 through 10, with the lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality financing receivables. Typically, we also consider financing receivables with a risk rating of 8 or higher to be impaired and will include them in the individual assessment for allowance. We evaluate the remainder of our financing receivables portfolio for impairment on a collective basis and record an allowance for credit loss at the portfolio segment level. When evaluating the financing receivables on a collective basis, we use historical default rates and expected default frequency rates published by major  third-party  credit-rating  agencies  as  well  as  our  own  historical  loss  rate  in  the  event  of  default,  while  also  systematically  giving  effect  to  economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation. Expected default frequency rates and historical default rates are published quarterly by major third-party credit-rating agencies, and the internal credit risk rating is derived by taking into consideration various customer-specific factors and macroeconomic conditions. These factors, which include the strength of the customer’s business and financial performance, the quality of the customer’s banking relationships, our specific historical experience with the customer, the performance and outlook of the customer’s industry, the customer’s legal and regulatory environment, the potential sovereign risk of the geographic locations in which the customer is operating, and independent third-party evaluations, are updated regularly or when facts and circumstances indicate that an update is deemed necessary. Financing  receivables  are  written  off  at  the  point  when  they  are  considered  uncollectible,  and  all  outstanding  balances,  including  any  previously  earned  but uncollected  interest  income,  will  be  reversed  and  charged  against  the  allowance  for  credit  loss.  We  do  not  typically  have  any  partially  written-off  financing receivables. Outstanding financing receivables that are aged 31 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. We do not accrue interest on financing receivables that are considered impaired or more than 120 days past due unless either the receivable has not been collected due to administrative reasons or the receivable is well secured and in the process of collection. Financing receivables may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management’s opinion, a timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a financing receivable has been categorized as nonaccrual, interest will be recognized when cash is received. A financing receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer’s delinquent balances of principal and interest have been settled, and the customer remains current for an appropriate period. We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing, generally with payment terms ranging  from 60 to 90 days.  In  certain  instances,  these  financing  arrangements  result  in  a  transfer  of  our  receivables  to  the  third  party.  The  receivables  are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive a payment for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. We also provide financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers related to leases and loans, which typically have terms of up to three years. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Deferred revenue relating to these financing arrangements is recorded in accordance with revenue recognition policies or for the fair value of the financing guarantees. (h) Leases We lease real estate, information technology (IT) and other equipment and vehicles. We also have arrangements with certain suppliers and contract manufacturers which includes the leasing of dedicated space and equipment costs. Our leases have the option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. As a lessee, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at commencement. Our ROU lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease  liabilities  represent  our  obligation  to  make  lease  payments  related  to  the  lease.  Operating  lease  ROU  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognized  at  the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use incremental borrowing rates based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of our lease payments. Certain of our lease agreements contain variable lease payments. Our variable lease payments can fluctuate depending on the level of activity or the cost of certain services where we have elected to combine lease and non-lease components. While these payments are not included as part of our lease liabilities, they are recognized as variable lease expense in the period they are incurred. We provide leasing of our equipment and complementary third-party products primarily through our channel partners and distributors, for which the income arising from these leases is recognized through interest income. As a lessor, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. We provide leasing arrangements for our equipment to certain qualified customers. Our lease portfolio primarily consists of sales-type leases. We allocate the consideration in a bundled contract with our customers based on relative standalone selling prices of our lease and non-lease components. The residual value on our leased equipment is determined at the inception of the lease based on an analysis of estimates of the value of equipment, market factors and historical customer behavior. Residual value estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and other-than-temporary declines are expensed in the period they occur. Our leases generally provide an end-of-term option for the customer  to  extend  the  lease  under  mutually-agreed  terms,  return  the  leased  equipment,  or  purchase  the  equipment  for  either  the  then-market  value  of  the equipment or a pre-determined purchase price. If a customer chooses to terminate their lease prior to the original end of term date, the customer is required to pay all remaining lease payments in full. For additional information, see Note 8. (i) Depreciation and Amortization   Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization, whenever applicable. Depreciation and amortization expenses for property and equipment were approximately $0.9 billion, $1.0 billion, and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method, generally over the following periods: (j) Business Combinations We allocate  the fair value of the purchase consideration of our acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities,  and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (IPR&D), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized  over  the  asset’s  estimated  useful  life.  Acquisition-related  expenses  and  related  restructuring  costs  are  recognized  separately  from  the  business combination and are expensed as incurred. (k) Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets   Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and, when specific circumstances dictate,  between  annual  tests.  When  impaired,  the  carrying  value  of  goodwill  is  written  down  to  fair  value.  Identifying  a  potential  impairment  consists  of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. See “Long-Lived Assets” for our policy regarding impairment testing of purchased intangible assets with finite lives. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired. (l) Long-Lived Assets   Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. (m) Fair Value   Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed  at  fair  value,  we  consider  the  principal  or  most  advantageous  market  in  which  we  would  transact,  and  we  also  consider  assumptions  that  market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair  value.  A  financial  instrument’s  categorization  within  the  fair  value  hierarchy  is  based  upon  the  lowest  level  of  input  that  is  significant  to  the  fair  value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. We use inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The fair values are determined based on model-based techniques such as discounted cash flow models using inputs that we could not corroborate with market data. (n) Derivative Instruments   We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately. For a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge of our foreign operations, the gain or loss is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within AOCI together with the offsetting loss or gain of the hedged exposure of the underlying foreign operations. Any ineffective portion of the net investment hedges is reported in earnings during the period of change. For derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change. We record derivative instruments in the statements of cash flows to operating, investing, or financing activities consistent with the cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness for foreign exchange forward contracts used as cash flow hedges is assessed by comparing the change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness for equity forward contracts and foreign exchange net investment hedge forward contracts is assessed by comparing changes in fair value due to changes in spot rates for both the derivative and the hedged item. For foreign exchange option contracts, hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the hedging instrument’s entire change in fair value. Hedge effectiveness for interest rate swaps is assessed by comparing the change in fair value of the swap with the change in the fair value of the hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. (o) Foreign Currency Translation   Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment, where that local currency is the functional currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with the resulting translation adjustments directly recorded to a separate component of AOCI. Income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are recorded in other income (loss), net. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents was not material for any of the fiscal years presented. (p) Concentrations of Risk   Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We seek to mitigate our credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, do not require collateral from our customers. We receive certain of our components from sole suppliers. Additionally, we rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide manufacturing services for our products. The inability of a contract manufacturer or supplier to fulfill our supply requirements could materially impact future operating results. (q) Revenue Recognition   We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We refer to our term software licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements as subscription offers. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer  receives  the  benefit  over  the  contract  term.  Our  hardware  and  perpetual  software  licenses  are  distinct  performance  obligations  where  revenue  is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized  ratably over the contract  term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes. An allowance for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The allowance for future sales returns as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019 was $79 million and $84 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue. Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our  distributors,  channel  partners  and  customers.  When  determining  the  amount  of  revenue  to  recognize,  we  estimate  the  expected  usage  of  these  programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. We assess certain software licenses, such as for security software, that contain critical updates or upgrades which customers can download throughout the contract term. Without these updates or upgrades, the functionality of the software would diminish over a relatively short time period. These updates or upgrades provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased security software licenses and are required to maintain the security license's utility as the risks and threats in the environment are rapidly changing. In these circumstances, the revenue from these software arrangements is recognized as a single performance obligation satisfied over the contract term. We adopted ASC 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method to those contracts that were not completed as of July 28, 2018. For the additional information, see Note 3. (r) Advertising Costs   We expense all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs included within sales and marketing expenses were approximately $187 million, $204 million, and $166 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. (s) Share-Based Compensation Expense   We measure and recognize the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs), and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Employee Stock Purchase Rights) based on estimated fair values. The fair value of employee stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-binomial option-pricing model (Lattice-Binomial Model) or the Black-Scholes model, and for employee stock purchase rights we estimate the fair value using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value for time-based stock awards and stock awards that are contingent upon the achievement of financial performance metrics is based on the grant date share price reduced by the present value of the expected dividend yield prior to vesting. The fair value of market- based stock awards is estimated using an option-pricing model on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense is reduced for forfeitures. (t)  Software  Development  Costs   Software  development  costs,  including  costs  to  develop  software  sold,  leased,  or  otherwise  marketed,  that  are  incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized if significant. Costs incurred during the application development stage for internal-use software are capitalized if significant. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the straight-line amortization method over the estimated useful life of the applicable software. Such software development costs required to be capitalized have not been material to date. (u) Income Taxes   Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. We account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes. (v) Computation of Net Income per Share   Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding includes the dilutive effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of such equity awards is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and the amount of compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. (w) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities  Our approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for variable interest entities focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity’s economic performance and which enterprise has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the variable interest entity. Should we conclude that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the variable interest entity will be included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (x) Use of Estimates   The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for the following, among others: The  inputs  into  certain  of  our  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  considered  the  economic  implications  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  our  critical  and significant accounting estimates. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods. Leases In  February  2016,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Accounting  Standards  Codification  (ASC)  842, Leases,  a  new  standard requiring lessees to recognize operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet, as well as corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets. This standard also made some changes to lessor accounting and aligns key aspects of the lessor accounting model with the revenue recognition standard. We adopted this standard at the beginning of fiscal 2020 and applied it at the beginning of the period of adoption and did not restate prior periods. In connection with the adoption of ASC 842, we recognized $1.2 billion of operating lease ROU assets, which was included in other assets and $1.2 billion of operating lease liabilities which was included in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities. There were no transition adjustments recorded from the adoption of ASC 842 as a lessor. We elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within ASC 842 which does not require reassessment of initial direct costs, classification of a lease and definition of a lease. We also elected additional practical expedients which resulted in: i) allowing us not to reassess the accounting treatment for existing or expired land easements in transition; ii) combining lease and non-lease components and iii) not recording leases with an initial term of less than 12 months on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Losses of Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The new standard replaces the incurred loss impairment model. Under this standard, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable, financing receivables, contract assets, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. We will adopt this standard at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2021 on a modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. This standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements at adoption. Revenue (a) Disaggregation of Revenue We disaggregate our revenue into groups of similar products and services that depict the nature, amount, and timing of revenue and cash flows for our various offerings.  The  sales  cycle,  contractual  obligations,  customer  requirements,  and  go-to-market  strategies  differ  for  each  of  our  product  categories,  resulting  in different economic risk profiles for each category. Amounts may not sum due to rounding. We have made certain reclassifications to the product revenue amounts for prior years to conform to the current year’s presentation. (1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the divestiture of the Service Provider Video Software Solutions (SPVSS) business. Total revenue includes SPVSS business revenue of $168 million and $903 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Infrastructure Platforms consist of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and data center products that are designed to work together to deliver networking capabilities and transport and/or store data. These technologies consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We are shifting and expanding more of our business  to  software  and  subscriptions  across  our  core  networking  portfolio.  Our  hardware  and  perpetual  software  in  this  category  are  distinct  performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Applications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions. The products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Security  primarily  includes  our  network  security,  cloud  and  email  security,  identity  and  access  management,  advanced  threat  protection,  and  unified  threat management products. These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers' network environments against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Other Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions and cloud and system management products. On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the SPVSS business. These products include both hardware and software licenses. Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered. The sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase or partner agreements. Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days. We provide financing arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings. Refer to Note 9 for additional information. For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time. Accounts receivable, net was $5.5 billion as of each of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, as reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Contract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to our customers. These amounts are primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred but we have not yet invoiced. As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, our contract assets for these unbilled receivables were $1.2 billion and $860 million, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets. Contract  liabilities  consist  of  deferred  revenue.  Deferred  revenue  was $20.4  billion as  of July  25,  2020 compared  to $18.5  billion as  of July  27,  2019.  We recognized approximately $10.6 billion of revenue during fiscal 2020 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at July 27, 2019. (c) Capitalized Contract Acquisition Costs We  capitalize  direct  and  incremental  costs  incurred  to  acquire  contracts,  primarily  sales  commissions,  for  which  the  associated  revenue  is  expected  to  be recognized in future periods. We incur these costs in connection with both initial contracts and renewals. These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds to the period of benefit. Deferred sales commissions were $732 million and $750 million as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets. The amortization expense associated with these costs was $477 million and $471 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was included in sales and marketing expenses. Acquisitions and Divestitures (a) Acquisition Summary We completed six acquisitions during fiscal 2020. A summary of the allocation of the total purchase consideration is presented as follows (in millions): The total purchase consideration related to our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2020 consisted of cash consideration and vested share-based awards assumed. The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately $23 million. On September 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of privately held Duo Security, Inc. (“Duo”), a leading provider of unified access security and multi-factor authentication delivered through the cloud. Revenue from the Duo acquisition has been included in our Security product category. On February 6, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Luxtera, Inc. (“Luxtera”), a privately held semiconductor company. Revenue from the Luxtera acquisition has been included in our Infrastructure Platforms product category. The total purchase consideration related to our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2019 consisted of cash consideration and vested share-based awards assumed. The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately $100 million. Fiscal 2018 Acquisitions In fiscal 2018, we completed eight acquisitions for total purchase consideration of $3.2 billion. (b) Divestiture of Service Provider Video Software Solutions Business On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the Service Provider Video Software Solutions business. This business had tangible assets of approximately $160 million (primarily comprised of accounts receivables, inventories and various other current and long-term assets) and net intangible assets and goodwill (based on relative fair value) of $340 million. In addition, the business had total liabilities of approximately $200 million (primarily comprised of deferred revenue and various other current and long-term liabilities). We recognized an immaterial gain from this transaction in fiscal 2019. We completed two divestitures during fiscal 2018. The financial statement impact of these divestitures was not material for fiscal 2018. (c) Pending Acquisitions at Year End On  July  9,  2019,  we  announced  our  intent  to  acquire  Acacia  Communications,  Inc.  (“Acacia”),  a  public  fabless  semiconductor  company  that  develops, manufactures  and  sells  high-speed  coherent  optical  interconnect  products  that  are  designed  to  transform  communications  networks  through  improvements  in performance, capacity and cost. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to pay total consideration of approximately $2.6 billion, net of cash and marketable securities, to acquire Acacia. The acquisition is expected to close during the first half of fiscal 2021, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Upon close of the acquisition, revenue from Acacia will be included in our Infrastructure Platforms product category. On  August  7,  2020,  we  completed  the  acquisition  of  ThousandEyes,  Inc.  (“ThousandEyes”),  a  privately-held  company.  ThousandEyes’  Internet  and  Cloud intelligence  platform  delivers  deep  visibility  and  insights  into  the  digital  delivery  of  applications  and  services  over  the  internet.  We  expect  that  most  of  the purchase price for the acquisition of ThousandEyes will be allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible assets. The financial statement impact of this acquisition will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. Total transaction costs related to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $21 million, $21 million, and $41 million, respectively. These transaction costs were expensed as incurred in G&A expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The goodwill generated from our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2020 is primarily related to expected synergies. The goodwill is generally not deductible for income tax purposes. The  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  include  the  operating  results  of  each  acquisition  from  the  date  of  acquisition.  Pro  forma  results  of  operations  for  the acquisitions completed during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 have not been presented because the effects of the acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our financial results. Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets (a) Goodwill Purchased intangible assets include intangible assets acquired through acquisitions as well as through direct purchases or licenses.   Americas $ 19,998  $ 1,240  $ (118)  $ 21,120 EMEA 7,529   486   (38)   7,977 APJC 4,179   274   (21)   4,432 Total acquisitions (six in total) 4.8  $ 161   4.2  $ 10   1.5  $ 1  $ —  $ 172 Fiscal 2019 Duo 5.0  $ 153   5.0  $ 94   2.5  $ 18  $ 77  $ 342 Luxtera 4.0   2   5.0   58   1.6   3   256   319 Others (three in total) 4.4   11   —   —   —   —   —   11 Restructuring and Other Charges In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated a restructuring plan (the “Fiscal 2021 Plan”), which includes a voluntary early retirement program, in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas with estimated pretax charges of approximately $900 million. These aggregate pretax charges will  be  primarily  cash-based  and  will  consist  of  severance  and  other  one-time  termination  benefits,  and  other  costs.  We  expect  the  plan  to  be  substantially completed in fiscal 2021. We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2020 (the “Fiscal 2020 Plan”) in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. The total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately $300 million. These aggregate pretax charges related to the Fiscal 2020 Plan are primarily cash-based and consist of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. In connection with the Fiscal 2020 Plan, we incurred charges of $255 million during fiscal 2020. We expect the Fiscal 2020 Plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021. In prior years, we initiated restructuring plans in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. The aggregate pretax charges related to these plans were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. These plans have been completed. Balance Sheet Details The following tables provide details of selected balance sheet items (in millions): Our provision for inventory was $74 million, $77 million, and $63 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are comprised of deferred revenue plus unbilled contract revenue. As of July 25, 2020, the aggregate amount of RPO was comprised of $20.4 billion of deferred revenue and $7.9 billion of unbilled contract revenue. We expect approximately 54% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next year. As of July 27, 2019, the aggregate amount of RPO was comprised of $18.5 billion of deferred revenue and $6.8 billion of unbilled contract revenue. Unbilled contract revenue represents noncancelable contracts for which we have not invoiced, have an obligation to perform, and revenue has not yet been recognized in the financial statements. Leases (a) Lessee Arrangements As of July 25, 2020, our operating lease right-of-use assets were $921 million and were recorded in other assets, and our operating lease liabilities were $1.0 billion, of which $341 million was included in other current liabilities and $661 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The weighted-average lease term was 4.0 years and the weighted-average discount rate was 1.5% as of July 25, 2020. (b) Lessor Arrangements Our leases primarily represent sales-type leases with terms of four years on average. We provide leasing of our equipment and complementary third-party products primarily through our channel partners and distributors, for which the income arising from these leases is recognized through interest income. Interest income for fiscal 2020 was $94 million and was included in interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The net investment of our lease receivables is measured at the commencement date as the gross lease receivable, residual value less unearned income and allowance for credit loss. For additional information, see Note 9. Actual cash collections may differ from the contractual maturities due to early customer buyouts, refinancings, or defaults. We provide financing of certain equipment through operating leases, and the amounts are included in property and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts relating to equipment on operating lease assets held by Cisco and the associated accumulated depreciation are summarized as follows (in millions): Our lease income for fiscal 2020 was $190 million and was included in product revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Minimum future rentals on noncancelable operating leases as of July 25, 2020 are summarized as follows (in millions): Financing Receivables (a) Financing Receivables Financing receivables primarily consist of lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables represent sales-type leases resulting from the sale of Cisco's and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average. Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services, which may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Loan receivables have terms of three years on average. Financed service contracts include financing receivables related to technical support and advanced services. Revenue related to the technical support services is typically deferred and included in deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed, which typically ranges from one to three years. We determine the adequacy of our allowance for credit loss by assessing the risks and losses inherent in our financing receivables by portfolio segment. The portfolio segment is based on the types of financing offered by us to our customers, which consist of the following: lease receivables,  loan receivables,  and financed service contracts. Our internal credit risk ratings of 1 through 4 correspond to investment-grade ratings, while credit risk ratings of 5 and 6 correspond to non-investment grade ratings. Credit risk ratings of 7 and higher correspond to substandard ratings. Past due financing receivables  are those that are 31 days or more past due according to their contractual payment terms. The data in the preceding tables is presented by contract, and the aging classification of each contract is based on the oldest outstanding receivable, and therefore past due amounts also include unbilled and current receivables within the same contract. As of July 25, 2020, we had financing receivables of $67 million, net of unbilled or current receivables, that were greater than 120 days plus past due but remained on accrual status as they are well secured and in the process of collection. Such balance was $215 million as of July 27, 2019. Available-for-Sale Debt and Equity Investments The following table summarizes our available-for-sale debt investments and equity investments (in millions): U.S. government securities $ 2,614  $ 71  $ —  $ 2,685 U.S. government agency securities 110   —   —   110 Corporate debt securities 11,549   334   (6)   11,877 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,987   49   (1)   2,035 Commercial paper 727   —   —   727 Certificates of deposit 176   —   —   176 U.S. government securities $ 808  $ 1  $ (1)  $ 808 Total $ 42  $ (13)  $ (242) U.S. government agency securities 169   —   —   169 Corporate debt securities 19,188   103   (29)   19,262 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 1,425   7   (11)   1,421 Total $ 18,888  $ 22,863 As of July 25, 2020, for available-for-sale debt investments that were in an unrealized loss position, we have determined that no other-than-temporary impairments were required to be recognized. Actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations. (b) Summary of Equity Investments Gains and losses recognized on our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in millions): July 25, 2020   July 27, 2019 Net gains and losses recognized during the period on equity investments $ 63  $ 58 Less: Net gains and losses recognized on equity investments sold (76)   (69) U.S. government agency securities $ 33  $ —  $ —  $ —  $ 33  $ — Corporate debt securities 1,060   (6)   3   —   1,063   (6) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 265   (1)   —   —   265   (1) U.S. government securities  $ 204  $ —  $ 488  $ (1)  $ 692  $ (1) U.S. government agency securities —   —   169   —   169   — Corporate debt securities 2,362   (4)   5,271   (25)   7,633   (29) U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities 123   —   847   (11)   970   (11) As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, we held equity interests in certain private equity funds of $0.7 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, which are accounted for under the NAV practical expedient. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers. These privately held companies and customers are evaluated for consolidation under the variable interest or voting interest entity models. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and our customer financings, and have determined that as of July 25, 2020, there were no significant variable interest or voting interest entities required to be consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of July 25, 2020, the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $1.3 billion. $0.7 billion of such investments are considered to be in variable interest entities which are unconsolidated. We have total funding commitments of $0.3 billion related to these privately held investments, some of which may  be  based  on  the  achievement  of  certain  agreed-upon  milestones,  and  some  of which  are  required  to  be  funded  on demand.  The  carrying  value  of  these investments and the additional funding commitments collectively represent our maximum exposure related to these privately held investments. Fair Value (a) Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): Level 1 marketable equity securities are determined by using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 available-for-sale debt investments are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Our derivative instruments are primarily classified as Level 2, as they are not actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the periods presented. Level 3 assets include certain derivative instruments, the values of which are determined based on discounted cash flow models using inputs that we could not corroborate with market data. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities recorded to fair value on a non-recurring basis is adjusted for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. These securities are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs such as volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value for purchased intangible assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was categorized as Level 3 due to the use of significant unobservable inputs in the valuation. Significant unobservable inputs that were used included expected revenues and net income related to the assets and the expected life of the assets. The difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets was recorded as an impairment charge, which was included in product cost of sales and operating expenses as applicable. The remaining carrying value of the specific purchased intangible assets that were impaired were zero as of July 25, 2020. The fair value of property held for sale was measured with the assistance of third-party valuation models, which used discounted cash flow techniques as part of their analysis. The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3, as significant unobservable inputs were used in the valuation report. The impairment charges as a result of the valuations, which represented the difference between the fair value less cost to sell and the carrying amount of the assets held for sale, were included in restructuring and other charges. We recognized an impairment charge of $65 million during fiscal 2020 and the remaining carrying value of the property held for sale that was impaired was $9 million as of July 25, 2020. U.S. government securities —   2,685   —   2,685   —   808   808 U.S. government agency securities —   110   —   110   —   169   169 Corporate debt securities —   11,877   —   11,877   —   19,262   19,262 U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities —   2,035   —   2,035   —   1,421   1,421 Commercial paper —   727   —   727   —   —   — Certificates of deposit —   176   —   176   —   —   — The fair value of our short-term  loan receivables  and financed  service  contracts  approximates  their carrying  value due  to their short duration.  The aggregate carrying  value  of  our  long-term  loan  receivables  and  financed  service  contracts  as  of July  25,  2020 and July  27,  2019 was $4.5  billion and $3.7  billion, respectively.  The estimated  fair value of our long-term  loan receivables  and financed  service contracts  approximates  their carrying  value. We use significant unobservable inputs in determining discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts, and therefore they are categorized as Level 3. As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, the estimated fair value of our short-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the short maturities. As of July 25, 2020, the fair value of our senior notes and other long-term debt was $17.4 billion, with a carrying amount of $14.6 billion. This compares to a fair value of $22.1 billion and a carrying amount of $20.5 billion as of July 27, 2019. The fair value of the senior notes and other long-term debt was determined based on observable market prices in a less active market and was categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Borrowings (a) Short-Term Debt The following table summarizes our short-term debt (in millions, except percentages): We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $10.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. The  effective  rates  for  the  short-  and  long-term  debt  include  the  interest  on  the  notes,  the  accretion  of  the  discount,  the  issuance  costs,  and,  if  applicable, adjustments related to hedging. July 25, 2020   July 27, 2019   Amount   Effective Rate   Amount   Effective Rate Current portion of long-term debt $ 3,005   2.07%  $ 5,998   3.20% Commercial paper —   —   4,193   2.34% Total short-term debt $ 3,005     $ 10,191 We have entered into interest rate swaps in prior periods with an aggregate notional amount of $2.5 billion designated as fair value hedges of certain of our fixed- rate  senior  notes.  These  swaps  convert  the  fixed  interest  rates  of  the  fixed-rate  notes  to  floating  interest  rates  based  on  the  London  InterBank  Offered  Rate (LIBOR). The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates. For additional information, see Note 13. Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes. Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable by us at any time, subject to a make- whole premium. The senior notes rank at par with the commercial  paper notes that have been issued in the future pursuant to our short-term  debt financing program, as discussed above under “(a) Short-Term Debt.” As of July 25, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

The credit agreement is structured as an amendment and restatement of our five-year credit facility which would have terminated on May 15, 2020, the end of its five-year term. As of July 25, 2020, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one-month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than 0.25%. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. Derivative Instruments (a) Summary of Derivative Instruments We use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties. See Note 17 for the effects of our cash flow hedging instruments on other comprehensive income (OCI) and the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We present our derivative instruments at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, our master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the derivative contracts would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $10 million and $13 million, respectively. To further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby cash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument. Under these collateral security arrangements, the net cash collateral received as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019 was $173 million and $76 million, respectively. Including the effects of collateral, this results in a net derivative asset of $8 million and $2 million as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts. We do not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes. We hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain revenues, operating expenses and service cost of sales with currency options and forward contracts.  These  currency  options  and  forward  contracts,  designated  as  cash  flow  hedges,  generally  have  maturities  of  less  than 24  months.  The  derivative instrument’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. During the fiscal years presented, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur. We enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, including long-term customer financings, investments, and payables. These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income (loss), net, and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of intercompany balances or other current assets, investments, or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity. We hedge certain net investments in our foreign operations with forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our net investment in those foreign subsidiaries. These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up to six months. Interest Rate Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges, Long-Term Debt We hold interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges related to fixed-rate senior notes that are due in fiscal 2021 through 2025. Under these interest rate swaps, we receive fixed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points. The effect of such swaps is to convert the fixed interest rates of the senior fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on LIBOR. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest expense and substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates. We may hold marketable equity securities in our portfolio that are subject to price risk. To diversify our overall portfolio, we also hold equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. The change in the fair value of each of these investment types are included in other income (loss), net. We  are  also  exposed  to  variability  in  compensation  charges  related  to  certain  deferred  compensation  obligations  to  employees.  Although  not  designated  as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense. Commitments and Contingencies (a) Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course  of  business,  in  order  to  manage  manufacturing  lead  times  and  help  ensure  adequate  component  supply,  we  enter  into  agreements  with  contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. A  significant  portion  of  our  reported  purchase  commitments  arising  from  these  agreements  consists  of  firm,  noncancelable,  and  unconditional  commitments. Certain  of  these  purchase  commitments  with  contract  manufacturers  and  suppliers  relate  to  arrangements  to  secure  long-term  pricing  for  certain  product components for multi-year periods. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, we had total purchase commitments for inventory of $4.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, the liability for these purchase commitments was $141 million and $129 million, respectively, and was included in other current liabilities. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $139 million, $95 million, and $105 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In  connection  with  our  acquisitions,  we  have  agreed  to  pay  certain  additional  amounts  contingent  upon  the  achievement  of  certain  agreed-upon  technology, development, product, or other milestones or upon the continued employment with Cisco of certain employees of the acquired entities. As of July 25, 2020, we estimated that future cash compensation expense of up to $271 million may be required to be recognized pursuant to the applicable business combination agreements. We also have certain funding commitments, primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding commitments were $0.3 billion as of each of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019. We accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material product costs, labor costs for technical support staff, and associated overhead. Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. In the ordinary course of business, we provide financing guarantees for various third-party financing arrangements extended to channel partners and end-user customers. Payments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the periods presented. Channel Partner Financing Guarantees   We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. During fiscal 2020, we expanded the payment terms on certain of our channel partner financing programs by 30 days in response to the COVID-19 pandemic environment. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The volume of channel partner financing was $26.9 billion, $29.6 billion, and $28.2 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively. End-User Financing Guarantees   We also provide financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers related to leases and loans, which typically have terms of up to three years. The volume of financing provided by third parties for leases and loans as to which we had provided guarantees was $9 million, $14 million, and $35 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Financing Guarantee Summary   The aggregate amounts of financing guarantees outstanding at July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, representing the total maximum potential future payments under financing arrangements  with third parties along with the related  deferred revenue, are summarized in the following table (in millions): In the normal course of business, we indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with us, with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to indemnify against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”), which acquired Time Warner Cable (“TWC”) in May 2016, is seeking indemnification from us for a final judgment obtained by Sprint Communications Company, L.P. (“Sprint”) against TWC in federal court in Kansas. Sprint sought monetary damages, alleging that TWC infringed certain Sprint patents by offering VoIP telephone services utilizing products provided by us generally in combination with those of other manufacturers. Following a trial on March 3, 2017, a jury in Kansas found that TWC willfully infringed five Sprint patents and awarded Sprint $139.8 million in damages. The Court awarded Sprint pre and post judgment interest of approximately $10 million and denied TWC’s post-trial motions and appeals. Charter reported that it paid the judgment in full. At this time, we are working with Charter to calculate the correct amount of indemnification. We do not believe that our indemnity obligations under our agreement will be material. We also have been asked to indemnify certain of our service provider customers that have been subject to patent infringement claims asserted by Chanbond, LLC (“Chanbond”) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on September 21, 2015. Chanbond alleges that 13 service provider companies, including  among  others,  Comcast  Corporation,  Charter  Communications,  Inc.  (“Charter”),  Time  Warner  Cable,  Inc.  (subsequently  acquired  by  Charter),  Cox Communications, Inc. (“Cox”), and Cablevision Systems Corporation, infringe three patents by providing high speed cable internet services to their customers utilizing cable modems and cable modem termination systems, consistent with the DOCSIS 3.0 standard, provided by us and other manufacturers generally used in combination with each other. Chanbond seeks monetary damages. On July 15, 2020, the Court vacated the August 19, 2020 trial date for Chanbond’s case against Cox and has not yet set a new trial date. The other cases against the remaining service provider defendants also have not  yet  been  set  for  trial.  We  believe  that  the  service  provider  defendants  have  strong  non-infringement,  invalidity  and  other  defenses.  Due  to  uncertainties surrounding the litigation processes, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of the cases at this time, but should Chanbond prevail in its cases against the service provider defendants, we do not believe that any potential indemnity liability would be material. During fiscal 2018, we recorded legal and indemnification settlement charges of $127 million to product cost of sales related to prior indemnification matters resolved in fiscal 2018. In  addition,  we  have  entered  into  indemnification  agreements  with  our  officers  and  directors,  and  our  Amended  and  Restated  Bylaws  contain  similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to uncertainties in the litigation process, coordination with other suppliers and the defendants in these cases, and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. Brazil Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. In addition to claims asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years, tax authorities from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, $0.8 billion of penalty and interest asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities against our Brazilian subsidiary on the theory of joint liability was dismissed on its merits. The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities that remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities  from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total remaining asserted  claims by Brazilian state and federal tax authorities aggregate to $155 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $756 million for interest, and $383 million for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of July 25, 2020. We have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the remaining asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. SRI International On September 4, 2013, SRI International, Inc. (“SRI”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, accusing our products and services in the area of network intrusion detection of infringing two U.S. patents. SRI sought monetary damages of at least a reasonable royalty and enhanced damages. The trial started on May 2, 2016, and, on May 12, 2016, the jury returned a verdict finding willful infringement. The jury awarded SRI damages of $23.7 million. On May 25, 2017, the District Court awarded SRI enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees, entered judgment in the new amount of $57.0 million, and ordered an ongoing royalty of 3.5% through the expiration of the patents in 2018. We appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on various grounds, and after various proceedings, on July 12, 2019, the Federal Circuit vacated the enhanced damages award; vacated and remanded in part the willful infringement finding; vacated and remanded the attorneys’ fees award for further proceedings; and affirmed the District Court’s other findings. On April 1, 2020, the District Court issued a final judgment on the remanded issues, finding no evidence of willful infringement and reinstating the $8 million award of attorneys’ fees. SRI appealed the judgment of no willful infringement to the Federal Circuit on April 3, 2020, and Cisco filed a cross-appeal on the attorneys’ fees award on April 9, 2020. Cisco has paid SRI $28.1 million, representing the portion of the judgment that the Federal Circuit previously affirmed, plus interest and royalties on post-verdict sales. While the remaining proceedings may result in an additional loss, we do not expect it to be material. Centripetal On February 13, 2018, Centripetal Networks, Inc. (“Centripetal”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern  District  of  Virginia,  alleging  that  several  Cisco  products  and  services  (including  Cisco’s  Catalyst  switches,  ASR  and  ISR  series  routers,  ASAs  with FirePOWER services, and Stealthwatch products) infringe eleven Centripetal patents. Cisco thereafter petitioned the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and Trademark Office to review the validity of nine of the asserted patents. The PTAB instituted inter partes review proceedings (“IPR Proceedings”) on six asserted patents and certain claims of another asserted patent. The PTAB has issued Final Written Decisions for seven patents in the instituted IPR Proceedings, and all claims of five patents have been found unpatentable and several of the claims of the other two patents have been found unpatentable. Starting on May 6, 2020 and concluding on June 25, 2020, the District Court conducted a bench trial by videoconference on the claims in the five patents not subject to the IPR Proceedings, including claims in three for which the PTAB declined to institute IPR Proceedings. Centripetal seeks damages, enhanced damages for willful infringement, and broad injunctive relief. While the trial result is uncertain, we believe that a District Court finding of validity and infringement, finding of willfulness, award of damages including any enhancement, and/or entry of injunctive relief are not supported by either the law or the evidence presented at trial. We intend to appeal any adverse outcome to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and we believe that any relief ultimately awarded would not be material. On April 29, 2020 and April 30, 2020, Centripetal submitted complaints in the District Court of Dusseldorf in Germany against Cisco Systems GmbH and Cisco Systems, Inc., asserting three European patents seeking both injunctive relief and damages. Two of the three European patents are counterparts to two U.S. patents Centripetal asserted against us in the U.S. District Court proceedings, one of which has been invalidated by the PTAB. We are currently assessing the cases filed in Germany. Due to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation processes in the U.S. and Europe, however, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of the cases at this time. Oyster Optics On November 24, 2016, Oyster Optics, LLC (“Oyster”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Oyster alleged that certain Cisco ONS 15454 and NCS 2000 line cards infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,620,327 (“the ‘327 Patent”). Oyster sought monetary damages. Oyster also had filed infringement claims based on the ‘327 Patent against other defendants, including ZTE, Nokia, NEC, Infinera, Huawei, Ciena, Alcatel-Lucent, and Fujitsu, and the District Court consolidated the cases alleging infringement of the ‘327 Patent. Oyster’s cases against some of the defendants were resolved. The District Court vacated the November 4, 2018 trial date set for Oyster’s claims against Cisco and one other remaining defendant, pending resolution of Oyster’s December 6, 2018 appeal of the District Court’s summary judgment ruling dismissing certain of Oyster’s claims. On May 8, 2020, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s summary judgment ruling. On June 18, 2020, Oyster dismissed its case against us based on the ‘327 Patent with prejudice. Finjan On January 6, 2017, Finjan, Inc. (“Finjan”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, seeking  injunctive  relief  and  damages,  including  enhanced  damages  for  allegations  of  willful  infringement.  Finjan  alleges  that  Cisco’s  AMP  and  ThreatGrid products and the URL rewrite feature of Cisco’s ESA Outbreak Filter product infringe five patents, four of which have expired. Finjan has conceded that they are not entitled to any pre-suit damages, accordingly it seeks approximately three weeks of damages for the alleged infringement of the 8,677,494 and 6,154,844 patents, approximately ten months of damages for the 6,804,780 patent, approximately three years of damages for the 7,647,633 patent, and approximately three- and-a-half years of past damages for the 8,141,154 patent and an ongoing royalty until its expiration on December 12, 2025. The case is currently set for jury trial starting October 19, 2020. While we believe that we have strong non-infringement arguments, that the patents are invalid, that Finjan’s damages theories are not supported by prevailing law and that Finjan will not be able to meet its burden required for injunctive relief, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of this litigation at this time due to uncertainties in the litigation processes. If we do not prevail in the District Court, we believe that any damages ultimately assessed would not be material. In addition, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property litigation. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. For additional information regarding intellectual property litigation, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Shareholders’ Equity (a) Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock We declared and paid cash dividends of $1.42, $1.36 and $1.24 per common share, or $6.0 billion each year, on our outstanding common stock during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. (b) Stock Repurchase Program In September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of July 25, 2020, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $10.8 billion, with no termination date. A summary of the stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program, reported based on the trade date, is summarized as follows (in millions, except per-share amounts): There  were no stock  repurchases  pending  settlement  as  of July  25,  2020.  There  were $40  million and $180  million in  stock  repurchases  that  were  pending settlement as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively. The purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to shareholders’ equity. We are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings or an increase to accumulated deficit and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital. Under the terms of our Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences, and terms of our authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. Employee Benefit Plans (a) Employee Stock Incentive Plans Stock Incentive Plan Program Description    As of July 25, 2020, we had one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”). In addition, we have, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued  share-based  awards  in  replacement  thereof.  Share-based  awards  are  designed  to reward  employees  for  their  long-term  contributions  to us  and provide incentives  for  them  to  remain  with  Cisco.  The  number  and  frequency  of  share-based  awards  are  based  on  competitive  practices,  operating  results  of  Cisco, government regulations, and other factors. Our primary stock incentive plan is summarized as follows: 2005 Plan    The 2005 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock grants, stock units and stock appreciation rights (SARs), the vesting of which may be time-based  or upon satisfaction  of performance  goals, or both, and/or other conditions.  Employees (including  employee directors  and executive  officers)  and consultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates and non-employee directors of Cisco are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. As of July 25, 2020, the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2005 Plan over its term was 694 million shares. The 2005 Plan may be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time and for any reason, and is currently set to terminate at the 2021 Annual Meeting unless re-adopted or extended by the shareholders prior to or on such date. Under the 2005 Plan’s share reserve feature, a distinction is made between the number of shares in the reserve attributable to (i) stock options and SARs and (ii) “full value” awards (i.e., stock grants and stock units). Shares issued as stock grants, pursuant to stock units or pursuant to the settlement of dividend equivalents are counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan on a 1.5-to-1 ratio. For each share awarded as restricted stock or a restricted stock unit award under the 2005 Plan, 1.5 shares was deducted from the available share-based award balance. For restricted stock units that were awarded with vesting contingent upon the achievement of future financial performance or market-based metrics, the maximum awards that can be achieved upon full vesting of such awards. If awards issued under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or terminated for any reason before being exercised or settled, then the shares underlying such awards, plus the number of additional shares, if any, that counted against shares available July 25, 2020   59  $ 44.36  $ 2,619 July 27, 2019   418  $ 49.22  $ 20,577 July 28, 2018   432  $ 40.88  $ 17,661 for issuance under the 2005 Plan at the time of grant as a result of the application of the share ratio described above, will become available again for issuance under the 2005 Plan. As of July 25, 2020, 183 million shares were authorized for future grant under the 2005 Plan. We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which 721.4 million shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance as of July 25, 2020. Eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month  offering  period, which  consists  of four  consecutive  6-month  purchase  periods. Employees  may  purchase  a limited amount of shares of our stock at a discount of up to 15% of the lesser of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of each 6- month purchase period. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on the earlier of (i) January 3, 2030 and (ii) the date on which all shares available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are sold pursuant to exercised purchase rights. We issued 18 million, 19 million, and 22 million shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of July 25, 2020, 141 million shares were available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Share-based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses for stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted stock, and RSUs granted to employees. The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense (in millions): As of July 25, 2020, the total compensation cost related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized was $3.9 billion, which is expected to be recognized over approximately 2.7 years on a weighted-average basis.

On the date of grant, we estimated the fair value of the total shareholder return (TSR) component of the PRSUs using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions for the valuation of time-based RSUs and PRSUs are summarized as follows: The PRSUs granted during the fiscal years presented are contingent on the achievement  of our financial performance metrics, our comparative market-based returns, or the achievement of financial and non-financial operating goals. For the awards based on financial performance metrics or comparative market-based returns, generally 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on the average of annual operating cash flow and earnings per share goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year over a three-year performance period. Generally, the remaining 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on our TSR measured against the benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same period. Each PRSU recipient could vest in 0% to 150% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics or our comparative market-based returns, and 0% to 100% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of non- financial operating goals. The valuation of employee stock purchase rights and the related assumptions are for the employee stock purchases made during the respective fiscal years. We used third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in our Black-Scholes model. We are responsible for determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share-based payment awards. We used the implied volatility for traded options (with contract terms corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock purchase rights) on our stock as the expected  volatility  assumption  required  in  the  Black-Scholes  model.  The  implied  volatility  is  more  representative  of  future  stock  price  trends  than  historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock purchase rights. The dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts at the grant date.

As allowed under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary contributions and after-tax contributions for eligible employees. The Plan allows employees to contribute up to 75% of their annual eligible earnings to the Plan on a pretax and after-tax basis, including Roth contributions. Employee contributions are limited to a maximum annual amount as set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code. We match pretax and Roth employee contributions up to 100% of the first 4.5% of eligible earnings that are contributed by employees. Therefore, the maximum matching contribution that we may allocate to each participant’s account will not exceed $12,825 for the 2020 calendar year due to the $285,000 annual limit on eligible earnings imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. All matching contributions vest immediately. Our matching contributions to the Plan totaled $295 million, $283 million, and $269 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Plan allows employees who meet the age requirements and reach the Plan contribution limits to make catch-up contributions (pretax or Roth) not to exceed the lesser  of 75% of  their  annual  eligible  earnings  or  the  limit  set  forth  in  the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  Catch-up  contributions  are  not  eligible  for  matching contributions. In addition, the Plan provides for discretionary profit-sharing contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. Such contributions to the Plan are  allocated  among  eligible  participants  in  the  proportion  of  their  salaries  to  the  total  salaries  of  all  participants.  There  were no discretionary  profit-sharing contributions made in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. We  also  sponsor  other  401(k)  plans  as  a  result  of  acquisitions  of  other  companies.  Our  contributions  to  these  plans  were  not  material  to  Cisco  on  either  an individual or aggregate basis for any of the fiscal years presented. The Cisco Systems, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”), a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, became effective in 2007. As required by applicable law, participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan is limited to a select group of our management employees. Under the Deferred Compensation  Plan,  which  is  an  unfunded  and  unsecured  deferred  compensation  arrangement,  a  participant  may  elect  to  defer  base  salary,  bonus,  and/or commissions, pursuant to such rules as may be established by Cisco, up to the maximum percentages for each deferral election as described in the plan. We may also, at our discretion, make a matching contribution to the employee under the Deferred Compensation Plan. A matching contribution equal to 4.5% of eligible compensation  in  excess  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  limit  for  qualified  plans  for  calendar  year 2020 that  is  deferred  by  participants  under  the  Deferred Compensation Plan (with a $1.5 million cap on eligible compensation) will be made to eligible participants’ accounts at the end of calendar year 2020. The total deferred  compensation  liability  under  the  Deferred  Compensation  Plan,  together  with  deferred  compensation  plans  assumed  from  acquired  companies,  was approximately $704 million and $678 million as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively, and was recorded primarily in other long-term liabilities. Comprehensive Income (Loss) The components of AOCI, net of tax, and the other comprehensive income (loss), excluding noncontrolling interest, are summarized as follows (in millions): Income Taxes (a) Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions): During fiscal 2018 and 2019, we recorded a total tax charge as a result of the Tax Act of $11.3 billion, consisting of $9.0 billion of tax expense for the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax and $1.1 billion of tax expense for DTA re-measurement. During fiscal 2020, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Cisco settled all outstanding items related to the audit of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal year ended July 30, 2011 through July 27, 2013. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a net benefit to the provision for income taxes of $102 million, which included a reduction in interest expense of $4 million. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax audit through fiscal 2013. Foreign taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided on a cumulative total of $6.8 billion of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of the end of fiscal 2020. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in such foreign subsidiaries.

The amount of potential unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is approximately $706 million. As a result of certain employment and capital investment actions, our income in certain foreign countries was subject to reduced tax rates. The tax incentives expired at the end of fiscal 2019. As of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018, the gross income tax benefits attributable to tax incentives were estimated to be $0.3 billion and $0.9 billion ($0.08 and $0.19 per diluted share) for the respective years. The gross income tax benefits were partially offset by accruals of U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings. As of July 25, 2020, $2.2 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if realized. During fiscal 2020, we recognized $104 million of net interest expense and increased our unrecognized tax benefits for prior year tax positions by $554 million to reflect expected settlement positions in on-going U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax return examinations. We recognized net interest expense of $30 million and $10 million, respectively, during fiscal 2019 and 2018. Our net penalty expense for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was not material. Our total accrual for interest and penalties was $340 million, $220 million, and $180 million as of the end of fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax audit for returns covering tax years through fiscal 2013. We are no longer subject to foreign or state income tax audits for returns covering tax years through fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2008, respectively. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. We believe it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign, and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months. Specific positions that may be resolved include issues involving transfer pricing and various other matters. We estimate that the unrecognized tax benefits at July 25, 2020 could be reduced by $150 million in the next 12 months. As of July 25, 2020, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $405 million, $1.2 billion, and $644 million, respectively. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards relates to acquisitions and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any  one  year.  If  not  utilized,  the  federal  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  will  begin  to  expire  in  fiscal  2022,  and  the  state  and  foreign  net  operating  loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2021. We have provided a valuation allowance of $98 million for deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses that are not expected to be realized. As of July 25, 2020, our federal, state, and foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $10 million, $1.2 billion, and $5 million, respectively.  The  federal  tax  credit  carryforwards  will  begin  to  expire  in  fiscal 2021.  The  majority  of  state  and  foreign  tax  credits  can  be  carried  forward indefinitely. We have provided a valuation allowance of $541 million for deferred tax assets related to state and foreign tax credits that are not expected to be realized. Segment Information and Major Customers (a) Revenue and Gross Margin by Segment We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis consisting of three segments: the Americas, EMEA, and APJC. Our management makes financial decisions and allocates resources based on the information it receives from our internal management system. Sales are attributed to a segment based on the ordering location of the customer. We do not allocate research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to our segments in this internal management system because management does not include the information in our measurement of the performance of the operating segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements  and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, and certain other charges to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include this information in our measurement of the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum due to rounding. Revenue in the United States was $26.1 billion, $27.4 billion, and $25.5 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. (b) Revenue for Groups of Similar Products and Services We design, manufacture, and sell IP-based networking and other products related to the communications and IT industry and provide services associated with these products and their use. (1) Includes SPVSS business revenue of $168 million and $903 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amounts may not sum due to rounding. We have made certain reclassifications to the product revenue amounts for prior years to conform to the current year’s presentation. The majority of our assets as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019 were attributable to our U.S. operations. In fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue. Our long-lived assets are based on the physical location of the assets. The following table presents our long-lived assets, which consists of property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets information for geographic areas (in millions): Net Income per Share The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted net income per share (in millions, except per-share amounts): Employee equity share options, unvested shares, and similar equity instruments granted and assumed by Cisco are treated as potential common shares outstanding in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of such equity awards is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and the amount of compensation cost for future service that has not yet been recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares.

The right to receive a grant of a restricted stock unit depends on Cisco’s satisfaction of certain [                      ] targets for FY[      ]. Assuming those targets are met or exceeded, the restricted stock units that you are granted will vest [                      ] percent on the date of grant and [                      ] percent on each of the next [              ] anniversaries of the date of grant thereafter, subject to your continued employment with Cisco or an affiliate on the applicable vesting date. On each vesting date, the vested units will be settled in Cisco common stock. In addition, in the unlikely event that a corporate transaction or change in control (each as defined in Cisco’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan) is consummated during FY[      ] or prior to the Compensation and Management Development Committee’s Certification regarding satisfaction of the FY[      ] performance conditions, the performance-based restricted stock unit right will be deemed fully earned at target (100%) immediately prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or the change in control, as the case may be, and will be settled in fully vested Cisco common stock at that time. Lastly, please note that, if you are employed outside the United States, the Compensation and Management Development Committee can grant the PRSU Right to you, in its sole discretion, only if and as long as it is permitted and feasible to grant restricted stock units under the laws of the country in which you are employed.

Unless and until the Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. determines otherwise, the following policy shall be applied to all outstanding equity awards issued under any equity plan maintained Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary, including outstanding equity awards and/or equity plans assumed by Cisco in connection with its acquisition of companies, and held by any employee of Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary (each such award shall be referred to herein as an “equity award”), except to the extent that the application of such policy would be prohibited any applicable law, rule or regulation or would result in adverse legal or tax consequences thereunder. Upon the death of an employee, Cisco will accelerate the vesting of the employee’s outstanding equity awards and any unvested equity award shares up to a specified limit based on the value of the equity awards and/or shares on the date of death. The limit on the amount of accelerated vesting is the greater of: (a) one- hundred percent (100%) of the unvested equity awards and/or unvested equity award shares up to a total value of $10 million; or (b) up to one year of vesting from the date of death as to all unvested equity awards and/or unvested equity award shares. For example, if an employee held unvested options for 100,000 shares with an exercise price of $1 which would vest in four annual installments of 25,000 shares, and the closing price of Cisco’s stock on the date of the employee’s death was $101, all 100,000 of the shares would become vested (100,000 shares x $100 (the difference between $101 and $1) = $10,000,000). Upon the terminal illness of an employee, Cisco will accelerate the vesting of the employee’s outstanding equity awards and any unvested equity award shares up to a specified limit based on the value of the equity awards and/or shares on the date of the terminal illness. An employee will be considered terminally ill upon the approval by Cisco’s employee life insurance provider of the accelerated life insurance benefit which indicates 12 months or less to live. When a request is made to accelerate the vesting of an employee’s outstanding equity awards and early life insurance payouts are not also requested, an employee will be considered terminally ill upon the approval by Cisco’s external, independent medical review vendor (which may include Cisco’s employee life insurance provider). The date of terminal illness will be the date the determination is made by Cisco’s employee life insurance provider or Cisco’s external, independent medical review vendor. The limit on the amount of accelerated vesting is the greater of: (a) one-hundred percent (100%) of the unvested equity awards and/or unvested equity award shares up to a total value of $10 million; or (b) up to one year of vesting from the date of the terminal illness as to all unvested equity awards and/or unvested equity award shares. For example, if an employee holds unvested options for 100,000 shares with an exercise price of $1 which would vest in four annual installments of 25,000 shares, and the closing price of Cisco’s stock on the date that the employee is determined to be terminally ill was $101, all 100,000 of the shares would become vested (100,000 shares x $100 (the difference between $101 and $1) = $10,000,000). to the extent the vesting of any performance-based restricted stock or stock unit award is accelerated pursuant to this policy, the award will be settled upon the death or terminal illness of an employee, as the case may be, except that if the applicable award is subject to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (“Code Section 409A”) and such terminal illness does not qualify as a “Disability” within the meaning of Code Section 409A, then the award will instead be settled on the fixed payment date following the end of the performance period on which the applicable award is normally paid out. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. Unless and until the Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. determines otherwise, the following policy shall be applied to all outstanding equity awards issued under any equity plan maintained Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary, including outstanding equity awards and/or equity plans assumed by Cisco in connection with its acquisition of companies, and held by any employee of Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary (each such award shall be referred to herein as an “equity award”), except to the extent that the application of such policy would be prohibited by any applicable law, rule or regulation or would result in adverse legal or tax consequences thereunder. The exercise or vesting schedule in effect for any outstanding equity award and any unvested shares previously acquired pursuant to any equity award (such shares referred to herein as “unvested equity award shares”) held by an employee at the time of the employee’s commencement of an authorized leave of absence shall continue to vest and/or become exercisable in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the applicable equity award agreement during the period the employee remains on such authorized leave of absence; provided that, in no event shall any employee be entitled to vest for more than 90 days of authorized leaves of absence during any rolling 12-month period (the “LOA Limit”). If an employee exceeds the LOA Limit during any rolling 12-month period, the unvested equity award shares held by such an employee shall be suspended immediately following the expiration of the LOA Limit and the equity award and any unvested equity shares shall not vest and/or become exercisable for any additional shares during the remainder of the rolling 12-month period. AS AMENDED JANUARY 27, 2016 CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. Unless and until the Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors of Cisco Systems, Inc. determines otherwise, the following policy shall be applied to all equity awards issued under any equity plan maintained Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary, including equity awards and/or equity plans assumed by Cisco in connection with its acquisition of companies, and held by any employee of Cisco or any Cisco subsidiary (each such award shall be referred to herein as an “equity award”), except to the extent that the application of such policy would be prohibited by the applicable equity plan, equity award agreement or any applicable law, rule or regulation. Except as provided below, equity awards and any unvested shares acquired pursuant to equity awards shall not be anticipated, assigned, attached, garnished, optioned, transferred or made subject to any creditor’s process in connection with the divorce of the holder of such equity award or shares. Equity awards and any unvested shares acquired pursuant to equity awards may be transferred by an executive officer of Cisco only to the extent required by a domestic relations order, as defined by the Internal Revenue Code or Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or the rules thereunder, in settlement of marital property rights by any court of competent jurisdiction.

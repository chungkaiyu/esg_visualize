At the start of fiscal 2020, we could not  have imagined what we would have to  face this year: the wide-ranging social  and economic impacts of the COVID-19  pandemic; the resulting changes to  businesses and how we work; and the  grim reminders of social injustice that have  persisted in society for too long. While  the year has brought many challenges, I  firmly believe that, with determination and  focus, we can turn them into opportunities  and progress. Navigating a global crisis with ingenuity  During difficult times like these, it reminds us  how strong we are when we come together.  At the start of the pandemic, we laid out  some principles to guide our approach  for supporting our employees, customers,  partners, and communities. We were  quickly able to get 95% of our employees  productively working from home, while also  hosting a series of weekly video check-ins  with guest speakers and medical and mental  health experts to discuss issues that were  top-of-mind. To support our customers’  business continuity, our teams worked  around the clock to scale our collaboration  and security capabilities, and we introduced  a variety of free offers and trials to make  sure everyone had the tools they needed  to operate. Our employees also came together to do all  they could to help the communities most in  need. They found ways to 3D-print surgical  face shields for healthcare workers, and they  suggested that our DX80 video units, instead  of sitting idle in our offices during lockdowns,  could be shipped to hospitals to enable  families to communicate with patients. These  are just a few examples of the significant  contributions we made to the pandemic  response. I am tremendously proud of what  our teams and IT teams around the world  have accomplished in delivering digital  connections despite the huge challenges  they faced. In the first half of fiscal 2020, we continued  to feel the effects of an increasingly  uncertain global macro environment.  This uncertainty was exacerbated by the  pandemic, which further impacted our  financial results in the second half of the  year. Although there continues to be a  lot of uncertainty, we believe our role and  responsibility have never been greater, as  businesses around the world are running on  Cisco technology to stay connected, secure,  and productive. By helping our customers  digitize for the future and inspiring new  possibilities for them, I am confident we will  emerge from this challenging time an even  stronger company than before. With the rapid shift to remote operations  and automation, many customers are  increasingly reliant on our broad portfolio  of technologies. As we prepare for what  comes next, we are helping our customers  modernize their infrastructure while  developing business resiliency solutions to  support new ways of working. Defining the future of the Internet with  unparalleled innovation  Our new business resiliency solutions build  upon some of our recent innovations. In  the applications space, we introduced new  technologies that provide deep insights  into the physical and virtual network  infrastructure through the lens of the  application, enabling real-time correction  and using automation to resolve issues  before they happen. Our acquisition of  ThousandEyes complements our portfolio  by providing deeper and broader visibility  and analytics across networks and  applications. By integrating these SaaS- based capabilities with our AppDynamics  application intelligence portfolio and Cisco  Intersight—our cloud-based management  platform, we believe we can provide  unparalleled observability, intelligence, and  insights at cloud-scale. In the collaboration space, our portfolio is  at the center of our customers’ strategies  for empowering teams and increasing  productivity. We take a security-first  approach and continue to scale our  analytics capabilities. We acquired Voicea,  which brought artificial intelligence (AI) and  automation capabilities to Webex, and we  introduced the Webex Assistant feature  for Webex Meetings, which captures  content and action items. We also acquired  CloudCherry, adding advanced analytics  and rich customer journey mapping to our  Contact Center portfolio. As we look to the  future, we will continue  to focus on what we can  control, operate with  transparency, keep  our minds and hearts  open, and have the  conviction to drive  progress — both inside  and outside Cisco. In security, we introduced Cisco SecureX,  a broad cloud-based security platform  connecting the breadth of our portfolio and  our customers’ security infrastructure by  providing unified visibility and automation  across applications, the network, endpoints,  and the cloud. We also integrated Cisco  SD-WAN with Cisco Umbrella, helping  customers evolve toward a SASE (Secure  Access Service Edge) architecture. This  future secure networking model, which  delivers security and networking services  together from the cloud, is intended to  enable organizations to securely connect  any user or device to any application with  the best experience. The broad and accelerating adoption  of multicloud and modern application  environments is changing how the world’s  largest networks are built, operated, and  secured, and Cisco is at the center of  this transition. We have made significant  investments in the development of software,  silicon, and optics—the building blocks for  the Internet for the future. We believe this  strategy will change the economics of how  the Internet will be built to support 5G and  400G, while helping our customers innovate  faster than ever before. During fiscal 2020, we  introduced Cisco Silicon One, a single, unified  silicon architecture, as well as the Cisco 8000  carrier-class router family built on Silicon  One, and our new IOS XR7 operating system.  We also announced new flexible purchasing  options that help enable customers to  consume our technology however they  choose. We collaborated closely with several  of the largest webscale companies throughout  the development process, and they are strong  advocates of our strategy. Our customers’ experience with Cisco and the  trust they place in us matter now more than  ever. They rely on us to help connect, secure,  and automate their environments so they can  achieve their desired outcomes. We have the  opportunity to leverage our broad portfolio  of turnkey solutions and strong customer  relationships to provide differentiated value  and cost savings for our customers. We want  to continue to make it as easy as possible for  our customers to consume our technology.  As a result, we are accelerating our efforts  to offer everything in our portfolio as a  service and cloud-delivered, simplifying and  automating as much as possible, and being  more flexible in its delivery. We will also accelerate our investments  in areas such as cloud security and  collaboration, increased automation in  the enterprise, the future of work, and  application insights and analytics. At the  same time, we will continue our focus on  multicloud investment, 5G and WiFi-6,  400G, optical networking, next-generation  silicon, AI, and more. Accelerating our shift to more software  and services  Throughout fiscal 2020, we demonstrated  operational resilience based on our solid  financial foundation, strong customer  relationships, differentiated innovation, and a  compelling strategic shift to more software  and subscription-based offerings built on the  strength of our key technology platforms. In fiscal 2017, we set a three-year goal for  30% of our revenue to come from software,  and while we achieved 29% in fiscal 2020,  we did achieve 31% in the fourth quarter. In  fiscal 2020, 74% of our software revenue  was sold as subscription, exceeding our  target of 66%. We also delivered 51% of our  revenue from software and services in fiscal  2020, exceeding our target of 50%. The momentum in shifting our business model  is contributing to our solid profitability. In fiscal  2020, we delivered another year of expanding  gross and operating margins. We also grew  our earnings per share in fiscal 2020 despite  the challenging environment. Looking to a brighter future with   renewed purpose  For 20 years, Cisco’s purpose was to change  the way the world lived, worked, played, and  learned by building networks that shaped the  Internet we all know and rely on today. past year, we paused to reflect and ask: what  comes next? We know our responsibilities  don’t end with technology; we want to make a  better world possible. We concluded that our  new purpose is to power an inclusive future  for all. This purpose can be fulfilled not only  through our technologies, which connect the  world, but also through our corporate social  responsibility activities, which are intended  to create positive opportunity for everyone. I  can’t think of a purpose more fitting for Cisco  or more relevant for today. We also developed a new framework for our  response to a crisis, an injustice, or a global  challenge. We will focus our efforts on the  most vulnerable; families and community;  research and resilience; and strategic  recovery. We are committed to thinking  beyond our initial response and using all our  resources and capabilities to work toward  long-term partnerships and solutions that  improve lives all around the world. The Cisco of today is more agile, innovative,  and focused. Thanks to our hard work over  recent years, we have delivered on our  financial commitments, brought market- leading innovation to our customers,  transitioned our business model, and  fostered a culture that has truly shined. As  we look to the future, we will continue to  focus on what we can control, to operate  with transparency, to keep our minds and  hearts open, and to have the conviction  to drive progress—both inside and outside  Cisco. I am confident we will emerge from  fiscal 2020 even better positioned to create  value for all our stakeholders. Thank you for your continued support. 0   2020 2019 2018 49.3 49.3 2020 2019 2018 13.7 36.7 12.6 Services revenue Product revenue 51.9 39.0 12.9 15.8 15.4 36.0 13.3 10   62.0% 2020 2019 2018 25.0% 62.9% Operating margin Gross margin 27.4% 26% EMEA 15% APJC 59% Americas 64.3% 27.6% This graph shows a five-year  comparison of the cumulative total  shareholder return on Cisco common  stock with the cumulative total returns  of the S&P 500 Index and the S&P  Information Technology Index.

Fiscal year ending July 25. Cisco Systems, Inc. As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud environment,  the network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace and our intent is to inspire  new possibilities for them by helping transform their infrastructure, expand applications and analytics, address their security needs,  and empower their teams. We believe that our customers are looking for intent-based networks that provide meaningful business  value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments. Our vision is to deliver highly  secure, software-defined, automated, and intelligent platforms for our customers. We are expanding our research and development  investments in certain product areas including cloud security, cloud collaboration, and application insights and analytics. We are  investing to optimize our product offerings for application to education, healthcare and other specific industries. We are also making  investments to enable us to increase automation and support the customer as the workplace changes. In addition, we continue to  remain focused on investments around SD-WAN, multicloud environments, 5G and WiFi-6, 400G speeds, optical networking, next  generation silicon and AI. We are also accelerating our efforts to enable the delivery of network functionality as a service. Our intent-based networking platform is designed to be intelligent, highly secure,  powered by “intent” and informed by “context”— features aiming to constantly learn,  adapt, automate and protect in order to optimize network operations and defend against  an evolving cyber threat landscape. Our intent-based networking offerings are designed  to provide a single, highly secure network fabric that helps ensure policy consistency  and network assurance; enables faster launches of new business services; and  significantly improves issue resolution times while being open and extendable. In our view, over the next several years, customers will be increasingly writing modern  software applications that can run on any hybrid cloud, and will be adding billions of  connections to their environment. They will need to be able to build applications quickly,  deploy them nearly anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time. Our security strategy is focused on delivering an effective cybersecurity architecture  combining network, cloud, and endpoint-based solutions. Our portfolio is designed to  prevent, detect, and remediate a cyber-attack and to integrate security across networking  domains. Our intent is to enable our customers to secure their networks for a multicloud  world by delivering a platform that continuously detects threats and verifies trust. As people are an important competitive advantage for our customers, teams need  effective and simple ways to work better together and interact with their customers to  build better relationships and increase collaboration. We are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. As our  core networking evolves, we expect we will add more common software features across  our core networking platforms. We are increasing the amount of software offerings that we  provide and the proportion of subscription software offerings. * Ms. Kramer notified Cisco of her decision to resign from Cisco.

Cisco is committed to shareholder-friendly corporate governance, and the Board of Directors has adopted clear corporate  policies that promote excellence in corporate governance. At Cisco, we recognize the  importance of regular and transparent  communication with our shareholders.  Each year, we continually engage with  a significant portion of shareholders  that include our top institutional  investors. In fiscal 2020, our Chairman  of the Board and Chief Executive  Officer, Secretary, and Investor  Relations team held meetings and  conference calls with investors  representing approximately 27% of  our outstanding shares, including  65% of our top 30 shareholders. We  engaged with these shareholders on a  variety of topics, including our business  and long-term strategy, corporate  governance and risk management  practices, board leadership and  refreshment, diversity, corporate social  responsibility initiatives (including  environmental, social, and governance  matters), executive compensation  program, and other matters of  shareholder interest. In fiscal 2020, we reached  out to investors representing  approximately 27% of our outstanding  shares, including 65% of our top  30 shareholders. We believe that risk is inherent in innovation and the pursuit of long-term growth  opportunities. Cisco’s management is responsible for day-to-day risk management  activities. The Board of Directors, acting directly and through its committees, is  responsible for the oversight of Cisco’s risk management. With the oversight of the  Board of Directors, Cisco has implemented practices, processes, and programs  designed to help manage the risks to which we are exposed in our business and to  align risk-taking with our efforts to increase shareholder value. Cisco’s management has implemented an enterprise risk management (ERM)  program, managed by Cisco’s internal audit function, that is designed to work across  the business to identify, assess, govern, and manage risks and Cisco’s response to  those risks. Cisco’s internal audit function performs an annual risk assessment that  is utilized by the ERM program. The structure of the ERM program includes both an  ERM operating committee that focuses on risk management-related topics and an  ERM executive committee consisting of members of executive management. The  ERM operating committee conducts global risk reviews and provides regular updates  to the ERM executive committee. The Audit Committee, which oversees financial and risk management policies, including  data protection (comprising both privacy and security), receives regular reports on ERM  from the chair of the ERM operating committee and regular reports on cybersecurity  from Cisco’s Chief Security and Trust Officer. Other board committees oversee specific  categories of risk associated with their respective areas of responsibility. The Board  of Directors regularly discusses core subjects with executive management, including  strategy, operations, information systems, finance, and legal and public policy matters,  in which risk oversight is an inherent element. We have adopted these policies and practices consistent with our commitment  to transparency and best-in-class practices, as well as to ensure compliance  with the rules and regulations of the SEC, the listing requirements of NASDAQ,  and applicable corporate governance requirements. Our pay practices align with our  pay-for-performance philosophy  and underscore our commitment  to sound compensation and  governance practices. These charts summarize the  major elements of target total direct  compensation for our CEO and our  other named executive officers  (NEOs1) as a group for fiscal 2020  and demonstrate our continued  pay-for-performance philosophy.

Cisco’s Board of Directors believes strongly in the value of an independent board of directors. Independent board members  have consistently comprised over 75% of the members of Cisco’s Board of Directors. All members of the key board  committees—the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Management Development Committee, and the Nomination and  Governance Committee—are independent. The role of the board of directors in strategy One of the Board’s key responsibilities is overseeing management’s formulation and execution of Cisco’s strategy. Throughout  the year, our CEO, the executive leadership team, and other leaders from across the company provide detailed business and  strategy updates to the Board. During these reviews, the Board engages with the executive leadership team and other business  leaders regarding various topics, including business strategy and initiatives, capital allocation, portfolio updates, the competitive  landscape, talent and culture including inclusion and diversity, ESG concerns including human rights implications of Cisco product  development and sales, and regulatory developments. Additionally, on an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves Cisco’s  financial plan. The Lead Independent Director also chairs regularly scheduled executive sessions of the independent directors,  without Cisco management present, during which Cisco’s strategy is reviewed and other topics are discussed.

Corporate social responsibility Our world is shaped by the expanding capabilities of information technology, which have the potential to create opportunities— or deepen inequalities. This dynamic defines our purpose: to power an inclusive future for all. We announced this new purpose in 2020 and began  to develop a framework for how we can fulfill it through our technology, actions, and intentions. Throughout our upcoming  2020 CSR Impact Report, which we intend to publish in December 2020, there will be examples of how Cisco is bringing this  purpose to life. By designing inclusive technologies, investing in underserved communities, and engaging our customers and  peers, there is so much we can do.  Cisco’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts are organized into several areas that guide our work to power an inclusive  future for all: trust and responsibility, leading a conscious culture, energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, circular  economy, supply chain excellence, and technology for good. Our previous CSR reporting framework comprised three pillars:  people, society, and planet. For fiscal 2020 we have adjusted those pillars to describe our commitments, goals, and impacts  more specifically and to focus on the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) topics that are significant to Cisco. Cisco Corporate Affairs leads our social investment programs and champions our commitment to CSR performance and  transparency. This team engages with internal and external stakeholders and leads CSR assessment and reporting activities,  which are aligned with standards set by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Cisco supports the United Nations’ Sustainable  Development Goals and aligns its environmental, social, and governance work with them.  The team works cross-functionally to assess and monitor CSR priorities, drive process for CSR management, and provide  reporting guidance and coordination across business functions. CSR priorities are owned by business functions and are integrated  into ongoing business strategy and planning. Business functions set CSR goals, implement plans, and measure performance.  Where a cross-functional approach is needed, teams are established to implement our commitments. The Nomination and Governance Committee of the Board reviews Cisco’s policies and programs concerning corporate social  responsibility, including environmental, social, and governance matters. This structure is designed to ensure we prioritize the  right issues as a company, and that we stay on track with our commitments. * These CSR Focus Areas are the significant topics identified in our FY19 Assessment. An updated, detailed assessment will be  completed for our FY21 CSR Impact report. More than 80% of the world’s web  traffic travels across Cisco connections,  and our software and solutions help  protect the data of millions of users  and over 500,000 organizations, from  hospitals and educational institutions to  critical infrastructure and government  agencies to businesses of all sizes  including the Fortune 500. Given the critical nature of the solutions  we provide, holding ourselves to the  highest standards as a trustworthy,  transparent, and accountable  company is vital to our business and  our customers. We design and build  solutions with security and privacy Cisco’s relationship with our people is  one of mutual benefit. Our employees  bring talent and ingenuity to design our  products and solutions, help safeguard  customers’ data, develop programs  that create competitive advantage, and  help us power an inclusive future. In  turn, we provide them with meaningful  careers and professional development  opportunities, as well as resources to  help them be healthy, empowered, and  purposeful in all aspects of life. Our values and expectations are laid out  in our Code of Business Conduct. Every  employee must certify compliance with  the code each year. In fiscal 2020, we  updated the code to include references  to our conscious culture. When people are respected for who  they are and encouraged to seek  balance between work and personal life,  we believe they are more productive  and successful in their jobs and able  to give their best to their families and  communities. In fiscal 2020, we met our  goal for 80% employee participation in  community impact. Employee actions  included advocating for causes,  volunteering, donating, and participating  in programs that positively impact  communities. We also doubled our  Time2Give benefit, which employees  can use for volunteer service, from 5  to 10 days for this calendar year. We  were honored to be ranked #1 on the  Great Place to Work® list of the World’s embedded from the start. We also  apply global principles of human rights  to the sourcing, design, and sale of  our products and work to integrate  a human rights perspective across  Cisco’s global business. Earning and upholding stakeholder  trust goes beyond the integrity of  solutions and networks. It also speaks  to our financial transparency and high  standards of ethical conduct. Cisco  has forged trusted relationships among  global stakeholders, and consistently  appears on lists of the world’s most  ethical businesses. Best Workplaces in 2019, with 93% of  employees surveyed saying Cisco is a  great place to work, and again in 2020. We know that we can’t become a  catalyst for social change until we first  embody that which we seek to build.  When we see injustice, we act boldly,  bravely, and deliberately to make  change, remove barriers, and support  communities. Recent events have  forced us all to take a hard look at our  world and the racism within it and have  galvanized us to lead needed change.  We have set out our commitment  to the African American (AA)/Black  community and detailed the actions we  will take in support of Social Justice.  These actions include influencing  our ecosystem to support policy,  legislation and organizations working  to ensure equal rights for AA/Black  people in 2020 and beyond; working to  increase the representation of AA/Black  employees at all levels of the company;  delivering anti-discrimination education  for our workforce; and more. We will continually reassess and  recalibrate our efforts when needed  to meet our goals and be transparent  about where we still need to do more  work. This is how we hold ourselves  accountable in the service of true  impact and change, as we continue to  expand these actions across the full  spectrum of diversity. The scope of environmental impact  we consider includes our operations,  extended operations (supply chain),  products, and services. We determine  our environmental priorities based on  their sustainability and business value.  We set public goals to address potential  environmental impacts and meet the  expectations of our stakeholders. In fiscal 2020, Cisco continued its  ongoing, 13-year effort to reduce our  total, worldwide Scope 1 and 2 GHG  emissions. To meet our Scope 1 and  2 GHG emissions reduction goal, Cisco  plans to invest $45 million in energy  efficiency and renewable energy over  the five-year goal period. At the end  of fiscal 2019, our emissions were  49% below our fiscal 2007 baseline  and 83% of our global electricity was  generated by renewable sources.* Our collaboration products enable  teleworking and reduce business travel,  increasing employee productivity and  building resilience for our business,  our partners, and our customers.  This resilience allowed our customers  to transition to extended work- from-home due to COVID-19 while  maintaining employee productivity and  customer engagement. * Fiscal 2020 performance will be reported in our 2020 Environmental Technical Review and our  CSR Impact Report scheduled for release in December 2020. Making the world a better place with  technology begins with how that  technology is designed, made, used,  and reused. We address environmental  and social impacts along the entire  product lifecycle to help ensure we  respect and uphold human rights,  promote worker health and well-being,  and minimize negative environmental  impacts. A responsible, resilient supply  chain is critical to our business success  and supports our ability to move from a  linear economy to a circular economy. The largest portion of Cisco’s carbon  footprint is from the operation of our  products by our customers. Cisco has  set a goal to improve large rack-mounted  equipment system power efficiency  from 77% to 87% by fiscal 2022 (fiscal  2016 baseline). This improvement will  reduce customer operating expense and  Cisco’s carbon footprint. In fiscal 2020,  we launched the Cisco® 8000 Series  family of routers, which, compared to  the prior generation, weighs far less and  requires only a fraction of the space and  power. Measured by material usage and  power, the Cisco 8000 Series is a win for  the environment. Cisco encourages employees to take  part in our environmental sustainability  efforts. We provide an online portal,  educational activities, and volunteer  opportunities to employees who want  to make an impact at work and in  their communities. We also sponsor  environment-related projects with  universities and global innovation  challenges for employees as well as for  university students and recent graduates.  These efforts are designed to improve  recruitment and retention among  candidate and employee cohorts that  increasingly make employment decisions  based on a company’s commitment to  environmental sustainability. As we source raw materials for  products, we consider how we can  reduce the demand on finite resources  and protect human rights during the  mining process. By designing products  and packaging grounded in circular  design, we can eliminate waste and  facilitate ease of repair, disassembly,  and reuse at end of life. During product assembly, we expect  our manufacturing suppliers, and  their suppliers, to uphold Cisco’s  standards for labor, health and safety,  environment, and ethics. We also  partner with suppliers to reduce their  own GHG emissions, build products  at zero-waste factories, and facilitate  our closed-loop material sourcing. Our  commitment to a circular economy  includes keeping equipment in use  longer and building a world-class  returns program that maximizes the  value of assets while reducing the  environmental impact of manufacturing  and waste on communities. The same technology that generates  sales for our business can also be  used by nonprofits working to solve our  greatest challenges, such as critical  human needs and disaster relief,  economic inequality, and education,  including training in digital skills. We are  helping address these challenges by  investing in early-stage solutions and  forming long-term partnerships that  allow organizations to put technology  to its highest and best use. We are  also teaching IT skills to millions of  students every year through the Cisco  Networking Academy and through  investing in entrepreneurs who  harness technology for social and  environmental impact. In fiscal 2020,  2.3 million people participated in Cisco  Networking Academy courses in 180  countries, bringing the total to 12.6  million students since inception. Cisco set a goal in 2016 to positively  impact one billion people through our  social impact grants and signature  corporate social responsibility programs.  We are proud that, by the end of  fiscal 2019, we had positively impacted  469 million people with the skills and  resources needed for an inclusive future.1 1 Some of our social impact grantees receive funding from other organizations.  Further details on our progress in fiscal 2020 will be available in our 2020 CSR  Impact report. For more information about our performance, see our CSR website at CSR.cisco.com.  Our 2020 CSR Impact Report and Environmental Technical Review are expected to be  published in December 2020. We know that collaboration is critical  to achieving our vision. Cisco was a  founding partner of the Ellen MacArthur  Foundation. We were also a founding  member of the Responsible Business  Alliance (RBA) and have long adopted the  RBA Code of Conduct as our Supplier  Code of Conduct. We actively engage  in other groups to influence practices  that promote circularity and responsible  sourcing across our value chain. This work aligns with Cisco’s core  values and, we believe, directly benefits  our business outcomes, including  business continuity, worker retention,  productivity, and customer satisfaction. As long as humanitarian crises exist  around the world, there cannot be an  inclusive future for all. Similarly, the  promise of a digital economy—where  connectivity unleashes new possibilities  for creativity and innovation—cannot  be realized until people’s basic needs  for food, water, shelter, and healthcare  are met. Our technology is particularly essential  when used to restore connectivity in crisis  zones. Cisco’s disaster response team,  Tactical Operations (TacOps), deploys  trained team members, supported by  employee volunteers, to restore mission- critical communications in the wake of  disasters and other events where first  responders need support. Since the  program began in 2005, the TacOps  team has responded to 64 worldwide  incidents, from natural disasters to forced  mass migration, providing free crisis  communication networks to support  recovery. The team continues to evolve to  meet changing global needs. Whatever challenges lie ahead of us,  Cisco intends to be ready to support  those who need it the most. At Cisco, we believe that by offering an attractive value proposition to customers and partners, by creating diverse and  inclusive workplaces and a conscious culture for employees, and by engaging regularly with shareholders and communities, we  can create and maximize long-term value.

Business We were incorporated in California in December 1984, and our headquarters are in San Jose, California. The mailing address of  our headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, and our telephone number at that location is (408)  526-4000. Our website is www.cisco.com. Through a link on the Investor Relations section of our website, we make available  the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC): our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form  8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. All such  filings are available free of charge. The information posted on our website is not incorporated into this report. As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud environment,  the network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace and our mission is to  inspire new possibilities for them by helping transform their infrastructure, expand applications and analytics, address their  security needs, and empower their teams. We believe that our customers are looking for intent-based networks that provide  meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments.  Our vision is to deliver highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms for our customers. We are expanding our research and development (R&D) investments in certain product areas including cloud security, cloud  collaboration, and application insights and analytics. We are investing to optimize our product offerings for application to education,  healthcare and other specific industries. We are also making investments to enable us to increase automation and support the  customer as the workplace changes. In addition, we continue to remain focused on investments around Software-Defined Wide  Area Network (SD-WAN), multicloud environments, 5G and WiFi-6, 400G speeds, optical networking, next generation silicon and  artificial intelligence (AI). We are also accelerating our efforts to enable the delivery of network functionality as a service. Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that have been powering the Internet since 1984. We are integrating intent- based technologies across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud. These technologies are designed  to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks. This will enable us to provide  customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business. We conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into the following three  geographic segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC). Our products and technologies are grouped into the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms; Applications; Security and  Other Products. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service offerings, including technical support  services and advanced services. Increasingly, we are delivering our technologies through software and services. Our customers  include businesses of all sizes, public institutions, governments, and service providers. These customers often look to us as a  strategic partner to help them use information technology (IT) to differentiate themselves and drive positive business outcomes. Our intent-based networking strategy began with Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) technology, one of our leading  enterprise architectures. We announced the initial development of new network product offerings featuring our intent-based  networking technology with the launch of the Catalyst 9000 series of switches. Our intent-based networking platform is designed  to be intelligent, highly secure, powered by “intent” and informed by “context”— features aiming to constantly learn, adapt,  automate and protect in order to optimize network operations and defend against an evolving cyber threat landscape. Our intent- based networking offerings are designed to provide a single, highly secure network fabric that helps ensure policy consistency  and network assurance; enables faster launches of new business services; and significantly improves issue resolution times while  being open and extendable. SD-Access, built on the principles of Cisco Digital Networking Architecture (DNA), provides what  we see as a transformational shift in the building and managing of networks. Our Catalyst 9000 series of switches represented the  initial build in our campus portfolio of our intent-based networking capabilities and provide highly differentiated advancements  in security, programmability, and performance while lowering operating costs through innovations in hardware and software. Since the initial launch, we have continued to transform our enterprise access portfolio by bringing together several technologies  to form the only integrated, intent-based architecture, with security at the foundation. This architecture is designed to help our  customers connect their users and devices over any network, to applications and data, no matter where they are. We have introduced several innovations that extend our intent-based networking capabilities to wireless and enterprise routing  products, including SD-WAN and Internet of Things (IoT) edge platforms. Our SD-WAN solutions are designed to provide direct  branch to cloud connectivity, enabling the workforce to access their software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications and workloads in  an optimized and highly secure manner. To further our innovation in this area, we are applying the latest technologies such as machine learning and advanced analytics  to operate and enhance network capabilities. These new network product offerings are designed to enable customers to detect  cybersecurity threats, for instance in encrypted traffic. We have created what is in our view the only network that is designed  for security while maintaining privacy. Our customers are operating in multicloud environments with private, public and hybrid clouds. For the data center, our strategy  is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency regardless of where applications or data  reside by extending our Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and our hyperconverged offerings. In fiscal 2020, we announced details of our technology strategy for the Internet for the Future aimed at addressing the broad  adoption of multicloud and application environments. We have made significant investments in the development of software,  silicon and optics — what we believe are the building blocks for the Internet for the future. We introduced Cisco Silicon One, a single unified silicon architecture, as well as the Cisco 8000 carrier-class router family built  on Silicon One and our new operating system. In our view, over the next several years, customers will be increasingly writing modern software applications that can run on  any hybrid cloud, and will be adding billions of connections to their environment. They will need to be able to build applications  quickly, deploy them nearly anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time. We believe we are uniquely positioned to enable successful business outcomes for customers in hybrid and multicloud  environments. In our view, the network is increasingly critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit  from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms. As our customers navigate the multicloud world, the need to connect new devices, protect their assets and monitor cloud  consumption, they will require advisory cloud services that are provided in a consistent manner. We are focused on enabling  simple, intelligent, automated and highly secure clouds by delivering the infrastructure to navigate complex IT environments  through our software and subscription-based offerings including Webex, Meraki cloud networking, and certain other Security  and Application offerings. We believe that customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique,  recognizing that we offer a solution for all cloud environments, including private, hybrid and public clouds. We believe data is one of our customers’ most strategic assets, and this data is increasingly distributed across every organization  and ecosystem, on customer premises, at the edge of the network, and in the cloud. As such, we believe that security is the top IT  priority for many of our customers. Our security strategy is focused on delivering an effective cybersecurity architecture combining  network, cloud and endpoint-based solutions. Our portfolio is designed to prevent, detect, and remediate a cyber-attack and to  integrate security across networking domains. Our intent is to enable our customers to secure their networks for a multicloud world  by delivering a platform that continuously detects threats and verifies trust. By combining a number of security technologies, we are delivering an end-to-end, zero-trust architecture. Additionally, through our offerings we help our customers shorten the time  between threat detection and response. Our customers’ communications continue to evolve as we move to a digital, cloud-based world. As people are an important competitive  advantage for our customers, teams need effective and simple ways to work better together and interact with their customers to build  better relationships and increase collaboration. As an example, we believe our collaboration portfolio which includes our subscription- based Webex conferencing platform, is at the center of our customers’ strategy for enabling teams to increase productivity. We are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Historically, our various networking technology  products have aligned with their respective product categories. However, increasingly our offerings are crossing multiple product  categories. As our core networking evolves, we expect we will add more common software features across our core networking  platforms. We are increasing the amount of software offerings that we provide and the proportion of subscription software  offerings. We have various types of software arrangements including system software, on premise software, hybrid software  and SaaS offerings. In terms of monetization, our software offerings fall into the broad categories of subscription arrangements,  including SaaS and term licenses, and perpetual licenses. As part of the transformation of our business, we continued to make strides during fiscal 2020 to develop and sell more software  and subscription-based offerings. We are also focused on the entire customer lifecycle to drive expansion and renewals. For a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We  depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to  predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and market share may  suffer.” For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Infrastructure Platforms consist of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and data center products  that are designed to work together to deliver networking capabilities and transport and/or store data. These technologies  consist of both hardware and software offerings that help our customers build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and  digitize data. We believe it is critical for us to continue to deliver continuous value to our customers. We continued to make  progress in shifting more of our business to software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio, and in expanding  our software offerings. Our objective is to continue moving to cloud-managed solutions across our enterprise networking  portfolio. We continue to expand on our intent-based infrastructure, which focuses on simplicity, automation, and security,  allowing enterprises to manage and govern the interactions of users, devices and applications across their IT environments. We  started with our Nexus 9000 series of switches for the data center, which along with ACI provide enhancements in security,  programmability and performance while lowering operating costs. Our Cisco Catalyst 9000 series of switches were developed  for security, mobility, IoT, and the cloud. These switches formed the foundation for our leading enterprise architectures, built on  the principles of Cisco DNA. We continued to expand on this technology by extending SD-Access and Cisco DNA Center across  our enterprise networking portfolio and by extending ACI to the public and private cloud. In addition, we now have a unified  operating system and policy management platform for our enterprise networking portfolio to drive simplicity and consistency  across our customers’ networks. Our switching portfolio encompasses campus switching as well as data center switching offerings. Our campus switching  offerings provide the foundation for converged data, voice, video, and IoT services. These switches offer enhanced security and  reliability and are designed to scale efficiently as our customers grow. Within campus switching are our Catalyst 9000 series of  switches that include hardware with embedded software, along with a software subscription referred to as Cisco DNA. Cisco  DNA provides automation, analytics and security features and can be centrally monitored, managed, and configured. Our data  center switching offerings provide the foundation for mission critical data centers with high availability, scalability, and security  across traditional data centers and private and public cloud data centers. We continue to add deeper and broader visibility and  analytics across our networks and applications, enabling us to deliver better experiences for our customers. Our routing portfolio interconnects public and private wireline and mobile networks, delivering highly secure and reliable  connectivity to campus, data center and branch networks. Our routing solutions are designed to meet the scale, reliability, and  security needs of our customers. We introduced the principles of Cisco DNA into our routing portfolio by integrating SD-WAN  into our offerings. In fiscal 2020, we launched the Cisco 8000 portfolio, a family of high density, low power next generation  routing platforms focused on our customers’ evolution to support 100G and 400G connectivity speeds. Our Wireless portfolio provides indoor and outdoor wireless coverage designed for seamless roaming use of voice, video,  and data applications. These products include wireless access points that are standalone, controller appliance-based, switch- converged, and Meraki cloud-managed offerings. We expanded our capabilities to include network assurance and automation  through Cisco DNA and Cisco DNA Spaces location-based services. Our Catalyst and Meraki Wi-Fi 6-based access points are  designed for high-density public or private environments to improve speed, performance, and capacity for wireless networking  in both homes and enterprises. Our Data Center portfolio incorporates various technologies and solutions including the Cisco Unified Computing System,  our hyperconverged offering, HyperFlex, and software management capabilities which combine computing, networking, and  storage infrastructure management and virtualization to deliver agility, simplicity and scale. These products are designed to  extend the power and simplicity of unified computing for data-intensive workloads, applications at the edge of the network, and  the next generation of distributed application architectures. The Applications product category consists primarily of software-related offerings that utilize the core networking and  data center platforms to provide their functions. Our Applications offerings consist of both hardware and software-based  solutions, including both software licenses and software-as-a-service. Applications include our collaboration offerings (unified  communications, Cisco TelePresence and conferencing) as well as AppDynamics and IoT software offerings. Our Collaboration strategy is to make communications more effective, comprehensive, and less complex by creating innovative  solutions through combining the power of software, hardware, and the network. We offer end-to-end solutions which can be  delivered from the cloud, premise or mixed environments, and which integrate voice, video, and messaging on fixed and mobile  networks across a wide range of devices/endpoints such as mobile phones, tablets, desktop and laptop computers, video units,  and collaboration appliances. Our Cognitive Collaboration integrates AI and machine learning across the Webex portfolio,  bringing intelligence and context to help our customers work smarter and increase productivity. Our Webex Cloud Contact  Center solution is designed to provide the agility, flexibility, scalability, security, efficiency and innovation in order to enable  better customer experiences for businesses and their customers. For on-premise collaboration markets, we launched multi-party  Internet Protocol (IP) Phones to extend our reach into third-party call control platforms as well as a new series of telephony  headsets which offer innovative integration with our market leading IP phone business. Our analytics solutions seek to help businesses deliver consistently high-quality digital experiences by connecting end- user experience and application performance to business outcomes. Our applications monitor, correlate, analyze, and act on  application performance and business performance data in real time. This automated, cross-stack intelligence enables developers,  IT operations, and business owners to make mission critical and strategic improvements. We continue to invest in IoT as the number of connected IoT devices continues to grow. Our Control Center Platform enables  enterprises to automate the lifecycle of connected devices, including tools designed to automatically and remotely onboard,  manage, and monetize their IoT devices. The Security product category primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management,  advanced threat protection, and unified threat management products. Our offerings are powered by cloud-delivered threat  intelligence based on our Cisco Talos technology. All of these products are part of our integrated cybersecurity architecture that  is designed to allow our customers to confront risks by continuously defending against threats and verifying trust, across their  environments. Regardless of size or industry, security continues to be a leading priority for our customers as they defend against  ongoing ransomware and account breaches that represent risk of compromise and economic loss to their businesses. We continue to integrate security across our portfolio as we believe our security solutions can help build a foundation of trust  between users, devices, and applications; across clouds, networks, and mobile workers. When targeted, our solutions help  prevent attacks by continuously detecting and remediating the most advanced threats. In fiscal 2020, we continued to invest in cloud-delivered security and extended our security platform with the launch of SecureX.  These investments included extending our zero-trust architecture with the on-going integration of Duo Security (“Duo”) and  integrating Umbrella with our SD-WAN solutions to help secure our customer’s network transformation toward a secure access  service edge (SASE). Building on our integrated architecture, we launched SecureX, a security platform that brings together the  breadth of the Cisco Security portfolio helping our customers accelerate responsiveness across the security lifecycle. Other Products Our Other Products category primarily consists of our cloud and system management and emerging technologies products. 4 In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers. Our overall  service and support offerings are combined into one organization, Customer Experience, that is responsible for the end-to-end  customer experience. Our support and maintenance services help our customers ensure their products operate efficiently, remain available, and benefit  from the most up-to-date system, and application software. These services help customers protect their network investments,  manage risk, and minimize downtime for systems running mission-critical applications. A key example is Cisco Smart Services,  which leverages the intelligence from the installed base of our products and customer connections to protect and optimize  network investment for our customers and partners. We have expanded these offerings from traditional hardware support to  software, solutions, and premium support. We also provide comprehensive advisory services that are focused on responsive, preventive, and consultative support of our  technologies for specific networking needs. We are investing in and expanding advisory services in the areas of software, cloud,  security, and analytics, which reflects our strategy of selling customer outcomes. We are focused on three priorities including,  utilizing technology advisory services to drive higher product and services; assessment and migration services providing the  tools, expertise and methodologies to enable our customers to migrate to new technology platforms; and providing optimization  services aligned with customers’ business expectations. Many factors influence the IT, collaboration, and networking requirements of our customers. These include the size of the  organization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location, and business applications deployed throughout the  customer’s network. Our customer base is not limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. In each of the past  three fiscal years, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue. Our customers primarily operate in the following  markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector. Enterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically  employ 1,000 or more employees. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a  multivendor environment. We offer service and support packages, financing, and managed network services, primarily through  our service provider partners. We sell these products through a network of third-party application and technology vendors and  channel partners, as well as selling directly to these customers. We define commercial businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1,000 employees. We sell to the larger, or  midmarket, customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These  customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less complexity.  Small businesses, or organizations with fewer than 100 employees, require information technologies and communication  products that are easy to configure, install, and maintain. We sell to these smaller organizations within the commercial market  primarily through channel partners. Service providers offer data, voice, video, and mobile/wireless services to businesses, governments, utilities, and consumers  worldwide. This customer market category includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers, web-scale operators  as well as Internet, cable, and wireless providers. We also include media, broadcast, and content providers within our service  provider market, as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional network-based, content- based and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks.  In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or  Internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require  network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose  requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach. Public sector entities include federal governments, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers.  Many public sector entities have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell  to public sector entities through a network of third-party application and technology vendors, and channel partners, as well as  through direct sales. As of the end of fiscal 2020, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 25,800 employees,  including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We have field sales offices in 95 countries, and we  sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial  portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Channel  partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical  support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also  typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators. Distributors typically hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through  distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Starting in fiscal 2019, in connection with the adoption of Accounting  Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, a new accounting standard related to revenue  recognition, we started recognizing revenue from two-tier distributors on a sell-in method. Prior to this, we recognized revenue  based on a sell-through method using point of sales information provided by these distributors. These distributors are generally given  business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates,  and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. For information regarding risks related to our channels, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “Disruption  of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “Inventory management relating to our sales to  our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.” For information regarding risks relating to our international operations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors  entitled “Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain  geopolitical environment;” “Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase  demands on our service and support operations;” “Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other  factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition;” “We are exposed to fluctuations  in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows;” and “Cyber-attacks, data breaches  or malware may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation, and cyber- attacks or data breaches on our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims  of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business,” among others. Our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, technical, project, quality, and software  maintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers. We provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. We believe  customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business, particularly for those customers involved in significant  infrastructure projects. Our financing arrangements include the following: The markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. Our growth strategy is  based on the components of innovation, which we sometimes refer to as “build, buy, partner, invest, and co-develop”. This five- prong approach to how we innovate can be summarized as follows: We have acquired many companies, and we expect to make future acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology  companies are inherently risky, especially if the acquired company has yet to generate revenue. No assurance can be given  that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or  operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and  technologies to an inability to do so. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,”  including the risk factor entitled “We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations  and harm our operating results.” We make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our  products or that provide strategic value. The risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk  Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and  in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.” We pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and  acceleration of new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology  exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or new market creation. Companies with which we have added  or expanded strategic alliances during fiscal 2020 and in recent years include Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon Web  Services, among others. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend  may increase. The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including  the risk factor entitled “If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from  such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.” We compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport,  and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. These markets are  characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and communications solutions that  offer relative advantages. These market factors represent both an opportunity and a competitive threat to us. We compete  with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions  may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in our new product  markets. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have  experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue. Our competitors (in each case relative to only some of our products or services) include: Amazon Web Services LLC;  Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; CommScope Holding Company, Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; Dell  Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace; F5 Networks, Inc.; FireEye, Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company; Huawei  Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Lenovo Group Limited; LogMeIn, Inc.; Microsoft Corporation; New Relic, Inc.;  Nokia Corporation; Nutanix, Inc.; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Slack Technologies, Inc.; Ubiquiti Networks;  VMware, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others. Some of these companies compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product  area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products  are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering  resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also  from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets.  We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic  alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise  data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing,  networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated within the data center. Due to several factors, including the  availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) offering  advanced services, standards-based protocols, cloud computing, and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within  the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and  potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed  to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments,  we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from  entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of  our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology, and suppliers from which we transfer  technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. Therefore, we must cooperate and at the same time  compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers,  and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition  and, accordingly affect our chances of success. We regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. We allocate our research and  development budget among our product categories, which consist of Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other  Product technologies. Our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific areas  of focus being identified from time to time. Recent areas of increased focus include our intent-based networking technologies  (which encompasses switching, routing, and wireless technologies within Infrastructure Platforms), conferencing, security, and  analytics products. Our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred. The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer  requirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our success depends in part upon our ability, on a cost- effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve  performance and reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering personnel work  with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of Internet working products, including  universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments, where appropriate,  to provide us with access to new technologies. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those products will achieve  market acceptance. We rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of independent third-party companies  to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary  software on electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to  maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique  combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The manufacturing process uses automated testing  equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed  to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001 standards. Our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing  process terms, such as continuity of supply; inventory management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and cost management;  oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any significant long-term  contracts with any manufacturing service provider. We generally have the option to renew arrangements on an as-needed basis. These  arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities beyond amounts covered by orders or  forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time. We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights,  trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in  the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also seek to  maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality  agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other countries. There can  be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products in every jurisdiction.  Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets has value, the rapidly changing  technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success dependent primarily on the  innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on the protection afforded by  patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws. Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may  be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past  experience and standard industry practice that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.  Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability  to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation  regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  Moreover, inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis  can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent  claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that our patents  and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property  rights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some  foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated  with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled  “Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,” “We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others,”  and “We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.” July 25, 2020 Employees by geography: United States . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38,900 Rest of world . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38,600 Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 77,500 Employees by line item on the Consolidated Statements of Operations: Cost of sales (1). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22,100 Research and development . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22,200 Sales and marketing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25,800 General and administrative  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,400 Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 77,500 (1) Cost of sales includes manufacturing support, services, and training.

She will continue to serve in her role  until such time as a replacement is appointed. and during this period she also founded and led the development of Broadrooms.com, an informational resource for executive  women who serve or want to serve on corporate boards in the U.S. Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and  uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking  statements contained in this report. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally,  including in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. In the second  half of fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our financial results and business operations, with a significant  impact in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 on our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints.  The magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting decline in global business activity is  uncertain. These disruptions include the unprecedented actions taken to try to contain the pandemic such as travel bans and  restrictions, business closures, and social distancing measures, such as quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future  materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Shelter-in-place orders and other measures,  including work-from-home and other policies implemented to protect workers, has and could in the future impact our supply chain.  Vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory or political reasons, and/or demand  changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. Such disruptions may continue, or worsen, in the future. In addition, current and  future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border  controls or closures, can also impact our ability to meet customer demand and could materially adversely affect us. Our customers  have also experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations, which can result in delayed, reduced,  or canceled orders, and increased collection risks, and which may adversely affect our results of operations. The COVID-19  pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with IT- related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust  our product and service offerings to match customer needs. The recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges. For example, governmental lockdowns, restrictions  or new regulations has and could in the future impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work with the same speed and  productivity in certain areas, even as other areas do not see negative impact. The extent and/or duration of ongoing workforce  restrictions and limitations could impact our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, and hold  product sales and marketing events to the extent we were able to previously. In addition, malefactors are seeking to use the  COVID-19 pandemic to launch new cyber-attacks. See the risk factors below entitled “Cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware  may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition, and damage our reputation, and cyber-attacks  or data breaches on our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims of  liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business” and “Vulnerabilities and critical security defects,  prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third party providers to remedy  vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or  solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business.” The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic  and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. The inputs into  certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our  critical and significant accounting estimates. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.  As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher  degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods. We are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements  of relevant authorities. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance is  currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory  and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the imposition of protective  public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. Potential negative impacts of these external factors  include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services; our supply chain and sales and  distribution channels; collectability of customer accounts; our ability to execute strategic plans; impairments; and our profitability  and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial  condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section. Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of  numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment.  These factors include: As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not  necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed  elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could  adversely affect our stock price. The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent, and is being significantly impacted by  the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2020, we continued to see a more broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic  environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. We also experienced continuing weakness in the service  provider market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets. Additionally, instability in the  global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical  environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the United Kingdom “Brexit” withdrawal from the European  Union, the current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties,  and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions,  or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our  business, operating results, and financial condition. Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly  germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. For example, emerging countries in the aggregate  experienced a decline in product orders in fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods. In addition, reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers’ perception of the  products of IT companies which design and manufacture products in the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT  supplier is critical to the development and growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in  response to reports of certain intelligence gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products  from customers outside of the United States and could have an adverse effect on our operating results. We expect to realign and dedicate resources into key priority and growth areas, such as Security and Applications, while also  focusing on maintaining leadership in Infrastructure Platforms and in Services. However, the return on our investments may  be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments  (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is  delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected. As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially  in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, the significant impacts of the COVID-19  pandemic, and related market uncertainty. During fiscal 2020, we continued to see a more broad-based weakening in the  global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. We also experienced continuing  weakness in the service provider market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did during fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods on  a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern  seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have experienced periods of time during which shipments have  exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition  to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular  shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as  in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related  component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers  are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur  and are not remediated within the same quarter. The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter, primarily  in the United States and in emerging countries. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our  operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the  timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results  could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. Inventory management remains an area of focus. We have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past  which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the  duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such  multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as  a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively. In addition, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead- time performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results. In addition, when  facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer  expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitments. Increases in our purchase commitments to shorten  lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long- term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below  expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results. Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services  and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of  personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods. Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router sales  and sales of certain other Infrastructure Platforms and Applications products, in addition to longer sales cycles. Service provider  product orders decreased during fiscal 2020 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent  quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product orders from the service  provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods  of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding  network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result of any  slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global economic downturn, or  periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,  and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline  for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example,  in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by slowdowns in the general  economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital  availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion plans. These conditions have  materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and some of these or other conditions in the service provider  market could affect our business and operating results in any future period. Finally, service provider customers typically have  longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a  larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing  from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers. If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations  weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales.  Our channel partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service  providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other  support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall  solution, and a number of service providers are also systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems  integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end  customer. These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for  changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. If sales through indirect channels increase, this  may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing of orders from our customers. Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels.  Although variability to date has not been significant, there can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution  model in future periods would not have an adverse effect on our gross margins and profitability. In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To the extent that  they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further,  sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our distribution channels. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and  communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete  with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may  increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in  key priority and growth areas. For example, as products related to network programmability, such as software defined networking  (SDN) products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop networking products  based on commoditized hardware, referred to as “white box” hardware, to the extent customers decide to purchase those product offerings instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter  the market. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have  experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.  For information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled “Competition” contained in Item 1. Business of this report. Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area.  Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly  formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than  we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other  competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also  sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances  in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies,  including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including  the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced services, standards based  protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning  multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data  center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end  technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the  development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term  strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form  alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer  technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time  compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers,  and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition  and accordingly affect our chances of success. We must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results  of operations. Our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too  high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products  and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our  distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in  selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we  balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence  because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. When facing component supply-related challenges, we have  increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. If we ultimately determine that we have  excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins. A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; a  significant increase in the price of one or more components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract  manufacturers; a failure to appropriately cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in  demand for our products could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially  damage customer relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated  to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to  purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins could  decrease. We have experienced longer than normal lead times in the past. Although we have generally secured additional supply or  taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the future, they could have a  material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. See the risk factor above entitled “Our revenue  for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.” Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our suppliers  and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by manufacturing  process issues, that have affected our operations. We may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result  of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced  by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry consolidation, or strong  demand in the industry for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to  accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal  component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a  substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. During periods  of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also  encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable  prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly,  our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely  affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need,  which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our  products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn  and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially  during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during  economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products  to customers and seriously impact present and future sales. Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. We purchase components  from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During  the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component  supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based  upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain instances, these agreements  allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being  placed. When facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order  to meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments. Increases in our purchase  commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less  than our expectations. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in excess or obsolete  components that could adversely affect our gross margins. For additional information regarding our purchase commitments with  contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new  product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on  our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production  costs of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed. The COVID-19  pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with  IT-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to  adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs. The process of developing new technology, including intent-based networking, more programmable, flexible and virtual  networks, and technology related to other market transitions— such as security, digital transformation and IoT, and cloud—  is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends  our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our  strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products  and services the market will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe  it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful,  many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products  related to network programmability, such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings  in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as,  for example, networking products based on “white box” hardware, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could  be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings  addressing these other transitions that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from  ours. In addition, our business could be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers  delay purchasing decisions to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings. We have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual products and services to selling products and  services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet the evolving needs of customers which include  offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to consume them. As a part of this transformation,  we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology, including changes in our  business models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop  do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is  incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning  and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in  competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market  share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors  to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new product and  service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new  products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and services. There can be no  assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and  services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services  and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The  products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market  success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to  consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment  in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology- related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims  from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate  recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments  and decisions. Although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our  requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include liabilities for  contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to the liabilities for  excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to perform goodwill  impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill impairment tests  may result in a charge to earnings. We initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which includes a voluntary early retirement program. The  implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business, and following completion of the restructuring  plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan. Our restructuring activities,  including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our  business, operating results, and financial condition. While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other  resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority  and growth areas, such as Security and Applications, and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in Infrastructure  Platforms and in Services. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the  anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do  not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating  results may be adversely affected. A substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the Internet, including the continued  development of the Internet and the anticipated market transitions, and on the deployment of our products by customers who  depend on such continued growth and evolution. To the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction  in capital spending adversely affect spending on Internet infrastructure, including spending or investment related to anticipated  market transitions, we could experience material harm to our business, operating results, and financial condition. Because of the rapid introduction of new products and changing customer requirements related to matters such as cost- effectiveness and security, we believe that there could be performance problems with Internet communications in the future,  which could receive a high degree of publicity and visibility. Because we are a large supplier of networking products, our  business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected, regardless of whether or not these  problems are due to the performance of our own products. Such an event could also result in a material adverse effect on the  market price of our common stock independent of direct effects on our business. Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products  on a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through  acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the  following: Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control,  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely  affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could  materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful  introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed and  marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre-acquisition  due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks  related to new product development also apply to acquisitions. See the risk factors above, including the risk factor entitled “We  depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail  to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and market share  may suffer” for additional information. As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large  telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. Several of our competitors may have greater resources,  including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure  deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in  emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be  no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities. Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including  the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. For example, as we add direct selling capabilities  globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements. There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as  companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are  unable to continue operations. For example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business  have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to- end technology solutions for the enterprise data center. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our  business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry  consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could  lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and  financial condition. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers,  with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace  composed of more numerous participants. We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software  typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. There can be no assurance that our pre-shipment  testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous  shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins. From time  to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in  products that we had shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved, would not  have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent  withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses, any of  which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017  we recorded a charge to product cost of sales of $125 million related to the expected remediation costs for anticipated failures in  future periods of a widely-used component sourced from a third party which is included in several of our products, and in the  second quarter of fiscal 2014 we recorded a pre-tax charge of $655 million related to the expected remediation costs for certain  products sold in prior fiscal years containing memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such, our growth depends in  part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers,  component suppliers and distribution partners. Our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in  orders in fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements in our business  in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. Our future results  could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations inside and  outside the United States, including impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political relationship  between the United States and other countries that can affect regulatory matters, affect the willingness of customers in those  countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States or affect our ability to procure components  if a government body were to deny us access to those components; government-related disruptions or shutdowns; and the  challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on  our operating results and financial condition, including, among others, the following: Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local  customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. We monitor individual customer payment capability  in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay, and  maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we  have also experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. We believe customer financing is a competitive factor in obtaining business, particularly in serving customers involved in significant  infrastructure projects. Our loan financing arrangements may include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services  but also providing additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our financing activities described above may increase if our customers are adversely  affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic uncertainty. Although we have programs in place that are  designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk, including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas, there  can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks. In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing  arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses. There  can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date, future losses,  if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A portion  of our sales is derived through our distributors. These distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a  portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. We  maintain estimated accruals and allowances for such business terms. However, distributors tend to have more limited financial resources than other resellers and end-user customers and therefore represent potential sources of increased credit risk, because they  may be more likely to lack the reserve resources to meet payment obligations. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit  markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain financing, those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted,  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt  investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market  price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair  value of our investments below their cost basis. Our non-marketable equity and other investments are subject to risk of loss of  investment capital. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under  development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies.  For information regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the  section titled “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements  in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, and they could have a  material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Historically, our primary exposures have related to nondollar- denominated sales in Japan, Canada, and Australia and certain nondollar-denominated operating expenses and service cost of  sales in Europe, Latin America, and Asia, where we sell primarily in U.S. dollars. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging  market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost  to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could  increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent that we must purchase components  in foreign currencies. We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and options to reduce the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on  certain foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables. In addition, we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency  cash flows. Our attempts to hedge against these risks may result in an adverse impact on our net income. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our  technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending,  there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented  or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology  are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In addition, there can be no assurance that  patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our  technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the  laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were  determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for  particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the  features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive  disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that  have enabled us to be successful. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive  patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us.  These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions,  particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some  pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in  advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others. The asserted claims  and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers, alleging infringement of their  proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of these  claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require  us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are made by customers, resistance As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit  versions of our products. While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture  of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in  prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee  that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased  our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise  legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results. Currently, few laws or regulations apply directly to access or commerce on the Internet. We could be materially adversely  affected by regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce in any country where we operate. Such regulations could include  matters such as voice over the Internet or using IP, encryption technology, sales or other taxes on Internet product or service  sales, and access charges for Internet service providers. The adoption of regulation of the Internet and Internet commerce could  decrease demand for our products and, at the same time, increase the cost of selling our products, which could have a material  adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Changes in telecommunications requirements, or regulatory requirements in other industries in which we operate, in the  United States or other countries could affect the sales of our products. In particular, we believe that there may be future changes  in U.S. telecommunications regulations that could slow the expansion of the service providers’ network infrastructures and  materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition, including “net neutrality” rules to the extent  they impact decisions on investment in network infrastructure. Future changes in tariffs by regulatory agencies or application of tariff requirements to currently untariffed services could affect  the sales of our products for certain classes of customers. Additionally, in the United States, our products must comply with  various requirements and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission and other regulatory authorities. In countries  outside of the United States, our products must meet various requirements of local telecommunications and other industry  authorities. Changes in tariffs or failure by us to obtain timely approval of products could have a material adverse effect on our  business, operating results, and financial condition. even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance that licenses will be available  on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if  a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential for high court awards that are  not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for significant amounts. If any  infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, if we are required to indemnify a  customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary  rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially  and adversely affected. For additional information regarding our indemnification obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated  Financial Statements contained in this report. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we  have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard  against infringement risks. Further, in the past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired  technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be  necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that  the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights  or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a  material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of  software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our  proprietary rights in our products. Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and  marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California.  Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to  remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our  overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and  share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. As a result of  one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us  to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and  attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel,  could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. In addition, companies in our  industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring  practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future. We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal  business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. For example, Brazilian authorities  have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a Brazilian importer of our products,  and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper transactions involving the  subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian subsidiary based on a theory of  joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax  authorities which remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from the state  of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total remaining asserted claims by Brazilian state and federal tax  authorities aggregate to $155 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $756 million for interest, and $383 million  for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of July 25, 2020. We have completed a thorough review of the  matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without merit, and we are defending the claims  vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding  the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with the importer, we are unable to determine  the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss,  if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. An unfavorable resolution of lawsuits or governmental  investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. For additional  information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.” Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated  in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the  valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible  income, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by  expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure;  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting  principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of  earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules.  Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance  for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international  association comprised of 37 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.  There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for  income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our  income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact  our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the  Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these  examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from  these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley  area of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located  near rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. Also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions  that have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the  future could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a  hurricane, volcano, or a flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Despite our implementation of security measures, the products and services we sell to customers, and our servers, data centers and  the cloud-based solutions on which our data, and data of our customers, suppliers and business partners are stored, are vulnerable  to cyber-attacks, data breaches, malware, and similar disruptions from unauthorized access or tampering by malicious actors  or inadvertent error. Any such event could compromise our products, services, and networks or those of our customers, and the  information stored on our systems or those of our customers could be improperly accessed, processed, disclosed, lost or stolen,  which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, give rise to legal/regulatory action,  and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and may cause damage to our  reputation. Efforts to limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security  efforts may be costly to implement and meet with resistance, and may not be successful. Breaches of security in our customers’  networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability  in our products or services, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business. The products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security  defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We may also make prioritization  decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix, and the timing of these fixes, which could result in an  exploit which compromises security. Customers also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay  implementation. In addition, we rely on third-party providers of software and cloud-based service and we cannot control the rate at  which they remedy vulnerabilities. Customers may also not deploy a security release, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions  of our products, services or cloud-based solutions containing the release, leaving them vulnerable. Vulnerabilities and critical  security defects, prioritization errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy  vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or  solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business. The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts  of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further  uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Likewise, events such as loss  of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts.  To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or  shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer  complementary products and services and in the past have established a joint venture to market services associated with our Cisco  Unified Computing System products. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally  to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and  result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business  areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other  business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer  delays in product development or other operational difficulties. Joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially  different interests of joint venture partners. Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our  actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and  us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of  operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. In addition, the  stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology  companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors,  as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other  significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors,  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. Additionally, volatility, lack of positive  performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may  adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance  of our stock price. As of the end of fiscal 2020, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $14.5 billion that  mature at specific dates from calendar year 2021 through 2040. We have also established a commercial paper program under  which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate  amount outstanding at any time of $10.0 billion, and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of  July 25, 2020. The outstanding senior unsecured notes bear fixed-rate interest payable semiannually. The fair value of the long- term debt is subject to market interest rate volatility. The instruments governing the senior unsecured notes contain certain  covenants applicable to us and our wholly-owned subsidiaries that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or  engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. In addition, we will be required to have available in the United States  sufficient cash to service the interest on our debt and repay all of our notes on maturity. There can be no assurance that our  incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing liquidity to us than would our use of our existing  cash resources. Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness  will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. In addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit  rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we  may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances. Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments Our corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in San Jose, California, in the United States of America. The locations  of our headquarters by geographic segment are as follows: Not applicable. In addition to our headquarters site, we own additional sites in the United States, which include facilities in the surrounding  areas of San Jose, California; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Richardson, Texas; Lawrenceville, Georgia; and  Boxborough, Massachusetts. We also own land for expansion in some of these locations. In addition, we lease office space in  many U.S. locations. Outside the United States our operations are conducted primarily in leased sites. Other significant sites (in addition to the two  non-U.S. headquarters locations) are located in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Poland,  and the United Kingdom. We believe that our existing facilities, including both owned and leased, are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of  our business. Item 3.  Legal Proceedings None. Item 2.

Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures On September 13, 2001, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program. As of July 25,  2020, the remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is  approximately $10.8 billion with no termination date.

Revenue for the years ended July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018 include SPVSS  revenue of $168 million and $903 million, respectively. Item 6.  Selected Financial Data Five Years Ended July 25, 2020 (in millions, except per-share amounts) (4) In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, Cisco completed the sale of the SP Video CPE Business. As a result, revenue from this portion of the  Service Provider Video product category did not recur in future periods. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $253 million net of certain  transaction costs. The year ended July 30, 2016 includes SP Video CPE Business revenue of $504 million. (3) In fiscal 2018, Cisco recorded a provisional tax expense of $10.4 billion related to the enactment of the Tax Act comprised of $8.1 billion  of U.S. transition tax, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion re-measurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities (DTA). (5) In fiscal 2016 Cisco recognized total tax benefits of $593 million for the following: i) the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Cisco settled  all outstanding items related to Cisco’s federal income tax returns for fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2010, as a result of which Cisco recorded  a net tax benefit of $367 million; and ii) the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 reinstated the U.S. federal R&D tax credit  permanently, as a result of which Cisco recognized tax benefits of $226 million. At the beginning of fiscal 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, a new accounting standard related  to revenue recognition, using the modified retrospective method to those contracts that were not completed as of July 28, 2018. No other factors materially affected the comparability of the information presented above.

We are integrating intent- based technologies across networking, security, collaboration, applications and the cloud. These technologies are designed  to help our customers manage more users, devices and things connecting to their networks. This will enable us to provide  customers with a highly secure, intelligent platform for their digital business. A summary of our results is as follows (in millions, except percentages and per-share amounts): Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In fiscal 2020, we delivered growth in margins and earnings per share in a very challenging environment with the COVID-19  pandemic. Total revenue decreased by 5% compared with fiscal 2019. Our product revenue declined in Infrastructure Platforms  and Applications, partially offset by growth in Security, and we continued to make progress in the transition of our business  model to increased software and subscriptions. We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe  that we have made continued progress on our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and  highly competitive environment. We saw broad-based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment during the fiscal  year which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. We also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider  market and emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these markets. While the overall environment remains  uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving profitable growth over the long term. Within total revenue, product revenue decreased 8% and service revenue increased by 3%. Total gross margin increased by  1.4 percentage points, driven primarily by productivity benefits and product mix partially offset by unfavorable impacts from  pricing. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses,  collectively, increased by 0.8 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased by 0.2 percentage  points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 1%, driven by a decrease in diluted share count of 199 million shares, partially  offset by a decrease in net income of 4%. In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $1.6 billion, driven in large part by a product  revenue decline in the United States. EMEA revenue decreased by $0.4 billion and revenue in our APJC segment decreased  by $0.5 billion. The “BRICM” countries experienced a product revenue decline of 25% in the aggregate, driven by decreased  product revenue in the emerging countries of India, China, Mexico and Brazil. From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue declines across all customer segments, with the most  significant declines in the commercial and service provider markets. During fiscal 2020, we saw a decline in business  momentum in the commercial and enterprise markets, which we believe was significantly related to weakness in the global  macroeconomic environment. From a product category perspective, total product revenue decreased 8% year over year. The decrease was driven by declines  in revenue in Infrastructure Platforms and Applications of 10% and 4%, respectively. These declines were partially offset by a  product revenue increase in Security of 12%. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, total revenue decreased by 9%.  Within total revenue, product revenue decreased by 13% and service revenue was flat. With regard to our geographic segment  performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas, EMEA and APJC decreased by 12%, 6% and 7% respectively.  From a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue declines in Infrastructure Platforms and Applications,  offset by growth in Security. Total gross margin decreased by 0.7 percentage points, driven by unfavorable pricing partially  offset by favorable product mix. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and  administrative expenses collectively decreased by 0.6 percentage points. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased  by 0.8 percentage points. Diluted earnings per share increased by 22% and net income increased by 19%. The fourth quarter of  fiscal 2019 included a $0.9 billion tax charge related to the Tax Act. During this extraordinary time, our priority has been supporting our employees, customers, partners and communities, while  positioning Cisco for the future. The pandemic has driven organizations across the globe to digitize their operations and support  remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before. We remain focused on providing the technology and  solutions our customers need to accelerate their digital organizations. The actions we are taking include: Employees •  Most of our global workforce working from home. •  Seamless transition to work from home with a long-standing flexible work policy, and we build the technologies that  allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive. •  For the remainder who must be in the office to perform their roles, we are focused on their health and safety, and are  taking all of the necessary precautions. Customer and Partners •  Introduced a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted  entire workforces to be remote. •  Announced a Cisco Capital Business Resiliency Program leveraging currently available funds to provide  organizations with access to financing solutions to offer financial flexibility and support business continuity. This  will help customers and partners access the technology they need now, invest for recovery, and defer most of the  payments until early 2021. Communities •  Committed significant funds to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. •  Providing technology and financial support for non-profits, first responders, and governments. •  Donating personal protective equipment to hospital workers including N95 masks and face shields 3D-printed by  Cisco volunteers around the world.

We believe that our customers are looking for intent-based networks that provide  meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments.  Our vision is to deliver highly secure, software-defined, automated and intelligent platforms for our customers. For a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see “Item 1. Business.” Other Key Financial Measures The following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2020 compared with fiscal 2019 (in millions): The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted  in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the  Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the  significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting  policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant  judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results  could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19  pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on  our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2020. These estimates include:  goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience  may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require  increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may  change materially in future periods. We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally  distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance  obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or  service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product  or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual  software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which  include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically  the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that  reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the  customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred  to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives  the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where  revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where  the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized  ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for  the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which  is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our  product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our  revenue net of any associated sales taxes. Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled  to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance  obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product  or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not  directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining  the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various rebate, cooperative  marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers. When determining  the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most  likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also consider the  customers’ right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits received by distributors under  these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical experience, our revenue could be  adversely affected. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of  impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in  determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or  a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to  us to determine whether such accruals should be made or adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive  patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us.  These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions,  particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is  successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms  and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation  techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill  as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company  over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual  basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of  fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly  transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and  consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There  was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2020, the excess of  the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $72.8 billion for the Americas, $51.6 billion for EMEA,  and $31.3 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of  our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not  result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition  date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used  in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to  reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these  acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the  rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in  circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured  by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We  review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the  difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values  and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of  factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business  strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment  charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the  statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, domestic manufacturing  deductions, foreign-derived intangible income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements,  nondeductible compensation, international realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 19.7%,  20.2%, and 99.2% in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. During fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we recorded a total tax charge of $11.3 billion, consisting of $9 billion of tax expense for the  U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, $1.2 billion of foreign withholding tax, and $1.1 billion of  tax expense for DTA re-measurement as a result of the Tax Act. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not  be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of  changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final  tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes  in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and  changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing  the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future  taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of  deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for  income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated  in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the  valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to domestic manufacturing deduction, foreign-derived intangible  income deduction, global intangible low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations  thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our  legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes  in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the  taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign  tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the  accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),  an international association comprised of 37 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing  tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our  provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments,  our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact  our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from  these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes  from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Total revenue in fiscal 2020 decreased by 5% compared with fiscal 2019. Product revenue decreased by 8% and service revenue  increased by 3%. Our total revenue reflected declines across each of our geographic segments. Product revenue for the emerging  countries of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 25% product revenue decline, with decreases in India, China, Mexico  and Brazil. In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including a reduced IT spending environment and reductions in spending  by government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to  revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing  arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other  factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions  may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 is presented  below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 can  be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2019, filed with the SEC on  September 5, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website  at investor.cisco.com.

Americas Product revenue in the Americas segment decreased by 8%. The product revenue decrease was across all of our customer  segments. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased by 7% in the United States, 13% in Canada, 27% in Mexico  and 14% in Brazil. The decrease in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 6% was driven by declines in the service provider, commercial and  enterprise markets, partially offset by growth in the public sector market. Product revenue from emerging countries within  EMEA decreased by 4%, and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries in  Western Europe, decreased by 6%. From a country perspective, product revenue decreased in the United Kingdom and France  by 12% and 7%, respectively, partially offset by a product revenue increase of 2% in Germany. Product revenue in the APJC segment decreased by 11%, driven by declines across all of our customer segments. From a country  perspective, product revenue decreased in Australia, India and China by 16%, 29% and 34%, respectively, partially offset by a  product revenue increase of 8% in Japan.

Infrastructure Platforms The Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless,  and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue decreased by 10%, or $3.0 billion. This was the product area most impacted  by the COVID-19 pandemic environment in the second half of fiscal 2020. Switching revenue declined in both campus switching  and data center switching, although we had revenue growth in our intent-based networking Catalyst 9000 Series. We experienced  a decrease in sales of routing products, with declines primarily in the service provider and enterprise markets. Revenue from  wireless products declined, although we saw revenue growth in our Meraki and WiFi6 products. Revenue from data center  declined driven by continued market contraction impacting primarily our servers products. The Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and  conferencing) as well as IoT and AppDynamics analytics software offerings. Revenue in our Applications product category  decreased by 4%, or $235 million, with a decline in Unified Communications and Cisco TelePresence partially offset by double  digit growth in AppDynamics and growth in IoT software offerings and Webex. Revenue in our Security product category increased 12%, or $333 million, driven by higher sales of identity and access, advanced  threat security, unified threat management and web security products. Revenue from our cloud security portfolio reflected  strong double-digit growth and continued momentum with our Duo and Umbrella offerings. The decrease in revenue from our Other Products category was primarily driven by a decrease in revenue from the SPVSS  business which we divested in the second quarter of fiscal 2019.

Product gross margin increased by 1.4 percentage points driven by productivity improvements and favorable product mix,  partially offset by unfavorable impacts from product pricing. In the second half of fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic, we incurred additional logistics costs, such as freight which had a negative impact on product gross margin. Our  product gross margin benefited slightly from the sale of our lower margin SPVSS business during the second quarter of  fiscal 2019. Productivity improvements were driven by memory cost savings and other cost reductions including value engineering efforts  (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational efficiency Years Ended July 25,   2020 July 27,   2019 July 28,   2018 Variance in Dollars Variance in Percent Service revenue: Americas  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 8,285 $ 8,173 $ 7,982 $ 112 1% Percentage of service revenue. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   62.2% 63.4% 63.3%   EMEA  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   3,012 2,854 2,754 158 6% Percentage of service revenue. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   22.6% 22.1% 21.8%   APJC. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   2,026 1,872 1,885 154 8% Percentage of service revenue. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   15.2% 14.5% 14.9%   Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 13,323 $ 12,899 $ 12,621 $ 424 3% Years Ended July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Gross margin: Product . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 22,779 $ 24,142 $ 22,282 63.3% 61.9% 60.7% Service  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,904 8,524 8,324 66.8% 66.1% 66.0% Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 31,683 $ 32,666 $ 30,606 64.3% 62.9% 62.0% Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.

Service revenue increased in  all geographic segments. 42 AMOUNT PERCENTAGE Years Ended 2020 vs. 2019 (1) The unallocated corporate items include the effects of amortization and impairments of acquisition-related intangible assets, share-based  compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments and restructurings,  and certain other charges. We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such  information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to productivity improvements and favorable  product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing. Product gross margin in our EMEA segment increased due to productivity improvements and, to a lesser extent, favorable  product mix, partially offset by negative impacts from pricing. The APJC segment gross margin percentage increase was due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially  offset by negative impacts from pricing. Higher service gross margin also contributed to the increase in the gross margin in this  geographic segment. The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or  may not be indicative of a trend for that segment.

The negative pricing impact, which was higher than the year-over-year impact we experienced  in fiscal 2019, was driven by typical market factors and impacted each of our geographic segments. The favorable product mix  impact was driven by impacts from each of our product categories. Service Gross Margin Our service gross margin percentage increased by 0.7 percentage point primarily due to higher sales volume. Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations  in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business.  Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the  gross margin from technical support services. R&D expenses decreased due to lower headcount-related expenses, lower discretionary spending and lower contracted services  spending, partially offset by higher share-based compensation expense. We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we  are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license  technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Sales and Marketing Expenses Sales and marketing expenses decreased primarily due to lower discretionary spending and contracted services spending.  G&A Expenses G&A expenses increased due to the benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with Arista Networks, Inc. (“Arista”) in  fiscal 2019 and higher discretionary spending, partially offset by gains recognized on the sale of property that had been held  for sale, lower headcount-related expenses, lower contracted services spending, and lower share-based compensation expense. In fiscal 2020, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, decreased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A  expenses by approximately $141 million, or 0.8%, compared with fiscal 2019.

Operating income decreased by 4%, and as a percentage of revenue operating income increased by 0.2 percentage points. These  changes resulted primarily from: a revenue decrease, the impact of the benefit from the $400 million litigation settlement with  Arista in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and higher restructuring and other charges, partially offset by a gross margin percentage  increase (driven by productivity improvements and product mix, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from pricing).

The decrease in interest expense was driven by a lower average debt balance and the impact of lower effective interest rates. We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2020 in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key  priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $300 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we  incurred charges of $255 million during fiscal 2020. We expect this restructuring plan to be substantially completed in fiscal  2021. We incurred total restructuring and other charges of $481 million in fiscal 2020. We incurred charges of $255 million related to  the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2020 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced  during fiscal 2018. These charges were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and other one-time termination benefits, and  other costs. We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from these restructuring actions in our key priority areas.  As a result, the overall cost savings from these restructuring actions are not expected to be material for future periods. The total change in net gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt investments was primarily attributable to higher realized gains  as a result of market conditions, and the timing of sales of these investments. The change in net gains (losses) on non-marketable  equity and other investments was primarily due to higher realized gains and higher unrealized gains, partially offset by higher  impairment charges. The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by higher donation expense as related to  COVID-19 programs, partially offset by net favorable foreign exchange impacts. The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 19.7% for fiscal 2020, compared with 20.2% for fiscal 2019.  The net 0.5 percentage point decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in net discrete tax charges. For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% and for further explanation of our  provision for income taxes, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was primarily driven by a net  decrease in debt of $10.2 billion, cash returned to shareholders in the form of repurchases of common stock of $2.7 billion  under the stock repurchase program and cash dividends of $6.0 billion, capital expenditures of $0.8 billion and net cash  paid for acquisitions and divestitures of $0.3 billion. These uses of cash were partially offset by cash provided by operating  activities of $15.4 billion. In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, on July 9, 2019 we announced our intent to acquire Acacia  Communications, Inc. for a net purchase consideration of approximately $2.6 billion in cash. Additionally, approximately $0.7  billion of the U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries and $3.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding  at July 25, 2020 will mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. See further discussion of liquidity and future  payments under “Contractual Obligations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term  investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our  portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high  quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position is critical at  this time of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain  access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase  of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments.  These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on  an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the  collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly  creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did  not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our  free cash flow annually to our shareholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The  following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions): Years Ended July 25, 2020 July 27, 2019 July 28, 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 15,426 $ 15,831 $ 13,666 Acquisition of property and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

For additional discussion, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk  Factors” in this report. We consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors because  of our intent to return a stated percentage of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases.  We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in  our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting  capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that  the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have  other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure  calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an  alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and  other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.

Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $10.8 billion, with no termination date. Accounts Receivable, Net The following table summarizes our accounts receivable, net (in millions): Inventory as of July 25, 2020 decreased by 7% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2019, and for the same period  purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by approximately 11%. On a combined basis,  inventories and purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers decreased by 10% compared with the end  of fiscal 2019. The decrease in inventory was primarily due to a decrease in finished goods and lower deferred cost of sales,  partially offset by an increase in raw materials. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services  for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate  component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory  based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing  manufacturing capacity. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers  to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to  arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our  reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. In  certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business  needs prior to firm orders being placed. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments levels are in line with our current  demand forecasts. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to  help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer  requirements. We believe the amount of our inventory and purchase commitments is appropriate for our revenue levels.

Lease receivables  include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying  assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may  include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We  also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support  services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period  during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 7%. COVID-19 Business Resiliency Program At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we initiated a new Business Resiliency  Program designed to help customers and channel partners mitigate financial challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  This program includes $2.5 billion in currently available funds to provide organizations with access to financing solutions. The  new Business Resiliency Program offered by us includes an up-front 90-day payment holiday and allows a customer to defer 95  percent of the payments for a new product or solution until calendar 2021, which in turn protects their business and increases  their existing cash flow. Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers  and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related  to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for  these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing  provided by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. During fiscal 2020, we expanded the  payment terms on certain of our channel partner financing programs by 30 days in response to the COVID-19 pandemic  environment. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The  receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables  from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The volume of channel partner financing was $26.9 billion, $29.6 billion, and $28.2 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018,  respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some  cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was  $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under  these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under  these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel  partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair  value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July  25, 2020, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $207 million, of which  approximately $28 million was recorded as deferred revenue. Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes, each of which is redeemable by us at any time,  subject to a make-whole premium. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of July 25, 2020. Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance  of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes.  We had no commercial paper notes outstanding as of July 25, 2020. We had $4.2 billion in commercial paper notes outstanding  as of July 27, 2019. Credit Facility On May 15, 2020, we entered into a 364-day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for  a $2.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 14, 2021. The credit agreement is structured  as an amendment and restatement of our five-year credit facility which would have terminated on May 15, 2020, the end of its  five-year term. As of July 25, 2020, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants,  and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest  at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank  of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved  by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest period of one month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency  Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC  and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the Eurocurrency Rate be less than 0.25%. We may also,  upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the  commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion. This credit agreement requires that we comply with  certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.

Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use  several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our purchase commitments are for short-term  product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our  purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing for certain  product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported estimated purchase commitments arising from  these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and Total deferred revenue increased 11% in fiscal 2020. The increase in deferred product revenue of 17% was primarily due to  increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. The increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the  impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue.

The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction  with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our  liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process.

See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities  for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing  of future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $1.9 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $81 million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes  payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our  excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary  course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we  have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our  authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt  instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of  certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain  employees of the acquired entities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of  which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on  demand. The funding commitments were $0.3 billion as of each of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019. We consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary  course of business, we have non-marketable equity and other investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain  of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our non-marketable  equity and other investments and customer financings, and we have determined that as of July 25, 2020 there were no material  unconsolidated variable interest entities. On an ongoing basis, we reassess our non-marketable equity and other investments and customer financings to determine if  they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting  guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these  entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel  partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment  by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing  Receivables and Guarantees.” While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased  disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely  affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash  and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit  lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the  following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual  obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other  liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with  unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well  as our requirements for, capital resources. Marketable Equity Investments The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We  may hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held  for purposes other than trading. We had no outstanding marketable equity securities as of July 25, 2020. Non-marketable Equity and Other Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance  Sheets. As of July 25, 2020, the total carrying amount of our non-marketable equity and other investments was $1.3 billion,  compared with $1.2 billion at July 27, 2019. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development  stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are  developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies.  Our evaluation of non-marketable equity and other investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in,  including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return. VALUATION OF SECURITIES GIVEN AN INTEREST RATE INCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Available-for-sale debt investments . . .   $22,017 $21,898 $21,779 $21,660 $21,541 $21,421 $21,302 Debt As of July 25, 2020, we had $14.5 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding. The carrying amount  of the senior notes was $14.6 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $17.4 billion. As of July 25, 2020, a  hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding  the $2.5 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.5 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical  change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged. Financing Receivables As of July 25, 2020, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $10.8 billion, compared with  $10.1 billion as of July 27, 2019. As of July 25, 2020, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would  change the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency  exchange risk. We have seen an increase in these risks and related uncertainties with increased volatility in the financial markets  in the current environment with the COVID-19 pandemic. Available-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our  primary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent  with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse  impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates as has also  happened recently, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for  our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment  objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our available-for-sale debt investments as of July 25, 2020. Our  available-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not  leveraged as of July 25, 2020. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating  categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments, including the hedging effects  when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect  immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS.  The hypothetical fair values as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019 are as follows (in millions): VALUATION OF SECURITIES GIVEN AN INTEREST RATE INCREASE OF X BASIS POINTS (150 BPS) (100 BPS) (50 BPS) 50 BPS 100 BPS 150 BPS Available-for-sale debt investments . . .   $17,877 $17,788 $17,699 $17,610 $17,522 $17,433 $17,344 At July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, we had no option contracts outstanding. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not  been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to  other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products  to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise  indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in  addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2020, foreign currency fluctuations,  net of hedging, decreased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $141 million, or  0.8%, as compared with fiscal 2019. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.- dollar denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency  options and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time  horizons. In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of  exposures, costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains  and losses on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost  of sales. We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations  on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market  risks associated with these foreign currency receivables, investments, and payables relate primarily to variances from our  forecasted foreign currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for  speculative purposes.

Consolidated Statements of Equity  (in millions, except per-share amounts) (a) Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity  of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with various  financial institutions. (b) Available-for-Sale Debt Investments We classify our investments in fixed income securities as available-for-sale debt  investments. Our available-for-sale debt investments primarily consist of U.S. government, U.S. government agency, corporate  debt, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody  of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale debt  investments sold. These investments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses  on these investments, to the extent the investments are unhedged, are included as a separate component of accumulated other  comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax. We classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and  their availability for use in current operations. The fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cisco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the last  Saturday in July. Fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 were each 52-week fiscal years. The Consolidated Financial Statements  include the accounts of ours and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the following three geographic segments: the  Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC). Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models.  The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments, if any, are presented as a separate component from our equity in the  equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The share of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interests are not presented  separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of the fiscal periods presented. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation.  We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued. 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (c) Equity Instruments Our equity investments are accounted for as follows: 1.  Basis of Presentation ▪ Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value  through income. ▪ Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost  less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. For certain of these  securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value of  these investments. (d) Impairments of Investments When the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost, it is deemed impaired,  and we will assess whether the impairment is other than temporary. An impairment is considered other than temporary if (i) we  have the intent to sell the security, (ii) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of  the entire amortized cost basis, or (iii) we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. If impairment  is considered other than temporary based on condition (i) or (ii) described earlier, the entire difference between the amortized  cost and the fair value of the debt security is recognized in earnings. If an impairment is considered other than temporary  based on condition (iii), the amount representing credit losses (defined as the difference between the present value of the cash  flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the debt security) will be recognized in earnings, and the amount  relating to all other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). ▪ Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to exert significant influence over the investee.  These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income  or loss. We hold non-marketable equity and other investments which are included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We  monitor these investments for impairments and make reductions in carrying values if we determine that an impairment charge  is required based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of these companies. CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (e) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates  actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We provide inventory write-downs based on excess and obsolete inventories determined  primarily by future demand forecasts. The write-down is measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and  market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory, which is a component of cost  of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in  facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. In addition, we record  a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers for  quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. (f) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility  of customer accounts. We regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality,  age of the accounts receivable balances, economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay, and expected default  frequency rates. Trade receivables are written off at the point when they are considered uncollectible. (g) Financing Receivables and Guarantees We provide financing arrangements, including leases, financed service contracts,  and loans, for certain qualified end-user customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. Lease receivables primarily  represent sales-type and direct-financing leases. Leases have on average a four-year term and are usually collateralized by a  security interest in the underlying assets. Loan receivables include customers financing purchases of our hardware, software  and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our  products and services. Loan receivables have terms of three years on average. Financed service contracts typically have terms  of one to three years and primarily relate to technical support services. We determine the adequacy of our allowance for credit loss by assessing the risks and losses inherent in our financing receivables  by portfolio segment. The portfolio segment is based on the types of financing offered by us to our customers: lease receivables,  loan receivables, and financed service contracts. We assess the allowance for credit loss related to financing receivables on either an individual or a collective basis. We consider  various factors in evaluating lease and loan receivables and the earned portion of financed service contracts for possible  impairment on an individual basis. These factors include our historical experience, credit quality and age of the receivable  balances, and economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. When the evaluation indicates that it is probable  that all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the financing agreement, including scheduled interest payments, are  unable to be collected, the financing receivable is considered impaired. All such outstanding amounts, including any accrued  interest, are assessed and reserved at the customer level. Our internal credit risk ratings are categorized as 1 through 10, with the  lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality financing receivables. Typically, we also consider financing receivables  with a risk rating of 8 or higher to be impaired and will include them in the individual assessment for allowance. We evaluate  the remainder of our financing receivables portfolio for impairment on a collective basis and record an allowance for credit loss  at the portfolio segment level. When evaluating the financing receivables on a collective basis, we use historical default rates  and expected default frequency rates published by major third-party credit-rating agencies as well as our own historical loss rate  in the event of default, while also systematically giving effect to economic conditions, concentration of risk, and correlation. Expected default frequency rates and historical default rates are published quarterly by major third-party credit-rating agencies,  and the internal credit risk rating is derived by taking into consideration various customer-specific factors and macroeconomic  conditions. These factors, which include the strength of the customer’s business and financial performance, the quality of the  customer’s banking relationships, our specific historical experience with the customer, the performance and outlook of the  customer’s industry, the customer’s legal and regulatory environment, the potential sovereign risk of the geographic locations in  which the customer is operating, and independent third-party evaluations, are updated regularly or when facts and circumstances  indicate that an update is deemed necessary. Financing receivables are written off at the point when they are considered uncollectible, and all outstanding balances, including  any previously earned but uncollected interest income, will be reversed and charged against the allowance for credit loss. We do  not typically have any partially written-off financing receivables. Outstanding financing receivables that are aged 31 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. We  do not accrue interest on financing receivables that are considered impaired or more than 120 days past due unless either the  receivable has not been collected due to administrative reasons or the receivable is well secured and in the process of collection.  Financing receivables may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management’s opinion, a timely collection of the full  principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a financing receivable has been categorized as nonaccrual, interest will be  recognized when cash is received. A financing receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer’s delinquent  balances of principal and interest have been settled, and the customer remains current for an appropriate period. (j) Business Combinations We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of our acquisitions to the tangible assets,  liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (IPR&D), based on their estimated  fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities  is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for  impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible  asset and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are  recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing,  generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer  of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and  we receive a payment for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing arrangements  facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements.  We also provide financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user customers related to leases and  loans, which typically have terms of up to three years. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the  event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Deferred revenue relating to these financing arrangements is  recorded in accordance with revenue recognition policies or for the fair value of the financing guarantees. (h) Leases We lease real estate, information technology (IT) and other equipment and vehicles. We also have arrangements  with certain suppliers and contract manufacturers which includes the leasing of dedicated space and equipment costs. Our leases  have the option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. As a lessee, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at commencement. Our ROU lease assets represent our right to use an  underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments related to the lease.  Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments  over the lease term. We use incremental borrowing rates based on information available at the commencement date to determine  the present value of our lease payments. Certain of our lease agreements contain variable lease payments. Our variable lease  payments can fluctuate depending on the level of activity or the cost of certain services where we have elected to combine lease  and non-lease components. While these payments are not included as part of our lease liabilities, they are recognized as variable  lease expense in the period they are incurred. We provide leasing of our equipment and complementary third-party products primarily through our channel partners and  distributors, for which the income arising from these leases is recognized through interest income. As a lessor, we determine if  an arrangement is a lease at inception. We provide leasing arrangements for our equipment to certain qualified customers. Our  lease portfolio primarily consists of sales-type leases. We allocate the consideration in a bundled contract with our customers  based on relative standalone selling prices of our lease and non-lease components. The residual value on our leased equipment is  determined at the inception of the lease based on an analysis of estimates of the value of equipment, market factors and historical  customer behavior. Residual value estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and other-than-temporary declines are expensed in  the period they occur. Our leases generally provide an end-of-term option for the customer to extend the lease under mutually- agreed terms, return the leased equipment, or purchase the equipment for either the then-market value of the equipment or a  pre-determined purchase price. If a customer chooses to terminate their lease prior to the original end of term date, the customer  is required to pay all remaining lease payments in full. For additional information, see Note 8. (i) Depreciation and Amortization Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization,  whenever applicable. Depreciation and amortization expenses for property and equipment were approximately $0.9 billion, $1.0  billion, and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the  straight-line method, generally over the following periods: Asset Category Period Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years Building improvements  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years Leasehold improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the  resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings  in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For a  derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported  as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective  portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately. For a derivative instrument designated as a net investment hedge  of our foreign operations, the gain or loss is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within AOCI together with the  offsetting loss or gain of the hedged exposure of the underlying foreign operations. Any ineffective portion of the net investment  hedges is reported in earnings during the period of change. For derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting  hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change. We record derivative instruments in the  statements of cash flows to operating, investing, or financing activities consistent with the cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness for foreign exchange forward contracts used as cash flow hedges is assessed by comparing the change in  the fair value of the hedge contract with the change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge  effectiveness for equity forward contracts and foreign exchange net investment hedge forward contracts is assessed by comparing  changes in fair value due to changes in spot rates for both the derivative and the hedged item. For foreign exchange option  contracts, hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the hedging instrument’s entire change in fair value. Hedge effectiveness for  interest rate swaps is assessed by comparing the change in fair value of the swap with the change in the fair value of the hedged  item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or  liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities  in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which  significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. We use inputs  such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted market  prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant  to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The fair values are determined based on model-based techniques  such as discounted cash flow models using inputs that we could not corroborate with market data. (m) Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in  an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements  for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value, we consider the principal or most  advantageous market in which we would transact, and we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when  pricing the asset or liability. The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize  the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level  of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization  within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. (k) Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter  and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. When impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down  to fair value. Identifying a potential impairment consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount,  including goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization  is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. See “Long-Lived Assets” for our policy regarding impairment  testing of purchased intangible assets with finite lives. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives are assessed for potential  impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might be impaired. (l) Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability of  long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual  disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the  difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower  of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. (o) Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment,  where that local currency is the functional currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet  date, with the resulting translation adjustments directly recorded to a separate component of AOCI. Income and expense accounts  are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are recorded in other income (loss), net. The  effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents was not material for any of the fiscal years presented. (p) Concentrations of Risk Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held with  banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand  and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We seek to mitigate  our credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, do not require  collateral from our customers. We receive certain of our components from sole suppliers. Additionally, we rely on a limited  number of contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide manufacturing services for our products. The inability of a contract  manufacturer or supplier to fulfill our supply requirements could materially impact future operating results. (q) Revenue Recognition We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services  which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain  multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit  from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment  to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our  hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple  obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software,  we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We refer to our term software  licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements as subscription offers. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that  reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once the  customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss has transferred  to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives  the benefit over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where  revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where  the term licenses are recognized upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized  ratably over the contract term as services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for  the customer to take possession of the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which  is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our  product sales, we record consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our  revenue net of any associated sales taxes. An allowance for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The allowance for future  sales returns as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019 was $79 million and $84 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction  of our accounts receivable and revenue. Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled  to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance  obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or  service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly  observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We apply judgment in determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration when  determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and various  rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and customers.  When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected  value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. We also  consider the customers’ right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. We assess certain software licenses, such as for security software, that contain critical updates or upgrades which customers can  download throughout the contract term. Without these updates or upgrades, the functionality of the software would diminish over  a relatively short time period. These updates or upgrades provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased security  software licenses and are required to maintain the security license’s utility as the risks and threats in the environment are rapidly changing. In these circumstances, the revenue from these software arrangements is recognized as a single performance obligation  satisfied over the contract term. We adopted ASC 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method to those contracts that were not  completed as of July 28, 2018. For the additional information, see Note 3. (r) Advertising Costs We expense all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs included within sales and marketing  expenses were approximately $187 million, $204 million, and $166 million for fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. (s) Share-Based Compensation Expense We measure and recognize the compensation expense for all share-based awards  made to employees and directors, including employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based restricted  stock units (PRSUs), and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Employee Stock Purchase  Rights) based on estimated fair values. The fair value of employee stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice- binomial option-pricing model (Lattice-Binomial Model) or the Black-Scholes model, and for employee stock purchase rights  we estimate the fair value using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value for time-based stock awards and stock awards that are  contingent upon the achievement of financial performance metrics is based on the grant date share price reduced by the present  value of the expected dividend yield prior to vesting. The fair value of market-based stock awards is estimated using an option- pricing model on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense is reduced for forfeitures. (t) Software Development Costs Software development costs, including costs to develop software sold, leased, or otherwise  marketed, that are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized if significant. Costs  incurred during the application development stage for internal-use software are capitalized if significant. Capitalized software  development costs are amortized using the straight-line amortization method over the estimated useful life of the applicable  software. Such software development costs required to be capitalized have not been material to date. (u) Income Taxes Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized  for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.  Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized. We account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.  The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is  more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes,  if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon  settlement. We classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment (or receipt)  of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes. (v) Computation of Net Income per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of  common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number  of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding includes the  dilutive effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of such equity  awards is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury  stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and the amount of compensation cost for future  service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. (w) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Our approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for variable interest  entities focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable  interest entity’s economic performance and which enterprise has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits  from the variable interest entity. Should we conclude that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets,  liabilities, and results of operations of the variable interest entity will be included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (x) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles  generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported  in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for the following, among others: Credit Losses of Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires measurement  and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held based on historical experience, current conditions, and  reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The new standard replaces the incurred  loss impairment model. Under this standard, we will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for  accounts receivable, financing receivables, contract assets, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to available- for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized  cost basis of the securities. We will adopt this standard at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2021 on a modified  retrospective basis with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. This standard will not  have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements at adoption. Leases In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)  842, Leases, a new standard requiring lessees to recognize operating and finance lease liabilities on the balance sheet, as well  as corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets. This standard also made some changes to lessor accounting and aligns key aspects  of the lessor accounting model with the revenue recognition standard. We adopted this standard at the beginning of fiscal 2020  and applied it at the beginning of the period of adoption and did not restate prior periods. In connection with the adoption of  ASC 842, we recognized $1.2 billion of operating lease ROU assets, which was included in other assets and $1.2 billion of  operating lease liabilities which was included in other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities. There were no transition  adjustments recorded from the adoption of ASC 842 as a lessor. We elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within ASC 842 which does not  require reassessment of initial direct costs, classification of a lease and definition of a lease. We also elected additional practical  expedients which resulted in: i) allowing us not to reassess the accounting treatment for existing or expired land easements in  transition; ii) combining lease and non-lease components and iii) not recording leases with an initial term of less than 12 months  on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19  pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially from our  estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry  a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods. Amounts may not sum due to rounding. We have made certain reclassifications to the product revenue amounts for prior years  to conform to the current year’s presentation. (1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the divestiture of the Service Provider Video Software Solutions (SPVSS) business.  Total revenue includes SPVSS business revenue of $168 million and $903 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The sales cycle, contractual obligations, customer requirements, and go-to-market  strategies differ for each of our product categories, resulting in different economic risk profiles for each category. The following table presents this disaggregation of revenue (in millions): 3.  Revenue (a) Disaggregation of Revenue Infrastructure Platforms consist of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and data center products  that are designed to work together to deliver networking capabilities and transport and/or store data. These technologies consist  of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers  build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We are shifting and expanding more of our business to  software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are  distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are  multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated  software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct  performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Applications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions. The  products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual  software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of  control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer  of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in  this category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the  contract term. Security primarily includes our network security, cloud and email security, identity and access management, advanced threat  protection, and unified threat management products. These products consist of both hardware and software offerings, including  software licenses and SaaS. Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its  intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers' network environments  against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance  obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are  distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this category  have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Other Products primarily include our Service Provider Video Software Solutions and cloud and system management products.  On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the SPVSS business. These products include both hardware and software licenses.  Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including  technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are  distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced  services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered. On September 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of privately held Duo Security, Inc. (“Duo”), a leading provider of unified  access security and multi-factor authentication delivered through the cloud. Revenue from the Duo acquisition has been included  in our Security product category. On February 6, 2019, we completed our acquisition of Luxtera, Inc. (“Luxtera”), a privately held semiconductor company.  Revenue from the Luxtera acquisition has been included in our Infrastructure Platforms product category.

The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately  $23 million. The sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase  or partner agreements. Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days. We provide financing  arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.  For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time. Accounts receivable, net was $5.5 billion as of each of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, as reported on the Consolidated  Balance Sheet. Contract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to  our customers. These amounts are primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred  but we have not yet invoiced. As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, our contract assets for these unbilled receivables were  $1.2 billion and $860 million, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets. Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was $20.4 billion as of July 25, 2020 compared to $18.5 billion  as of July 27, 2019. We recognized approximately $10.6 billion of revenue during fiscal 2020 that was included in the deferred  revenue balance at July 27, 2019. We capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts, primarily sales commissions, for which the associated  revenue is expected to be recognized in future periods. We incur these costs in connection with both initial contracts and  renewals. These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds  to the period of benefit. Deferred sales commissions were $732 million and $750 million as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019,  respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets. The amortization expense associated with these costs  was $477 million and $471 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and was included in sales and marketing expenses. 4.  Acquisitions and Divestitures  (a) Acquisition Summary We completed six acquisitions during fiscal 2020. A summary of the allocation of the total purchase consideration is presented  as follows (in millions): Purchased  Intangible  Assets Goodwill Total acquisitions (six in total) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 359 $ (11) $ 172 $ 198 Foreign  Currency  Translation  and Other Balance at  July 25, 2020 Americas. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 21,120 $ 132 $ 52 $ 21,304 EMEA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7,977 44 19 8,040 APJC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,432 22 8 4,462 Total. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 33,529 $ 198 $ 79 $ 33,806 The total purchase consideration related to our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2019 consisted of cash consideration and  vested share-based awards assumed. The total cash and cash equivalents acquired from these acquisitions was approximately  $100 million. Fiscal 2018 Acquisitions  In fiscal 2018, we completed eight acquisitions for total purchase consideration of $3.2 billion. (b) Divestiture of Service Provider Video Software Solutions Business On October 28, 2018, we completed the sale of the Service Provider Video Software Solutions business. This business had  tangible assets of approximately $160 million (primarily comprised of accounts receivables, inventories and various other  current and long -term assets) and net intangible assets and goodwill (based on relative fair value) of $340 million. In addition,  the business had total liabilities of approximately $200 million (primarily comprised of deferred revenue and various other  current and long-term liabilities). We recognized an immaterial gain from this transaction in fiscal 2019. We completed two divestitures during fiscal 2018. The financial statement impact of these divestitures was not material for  fiscal 2018. On July 9, 2019, we announced our intent to acquire Acacia Communications, Inc. (“Acacia”), a public fabless semiconductor  company that develops, manufactures and sells high-speed coherent optical interconnect products that are designed to transform  communications networks through improvements in performance, capacity and cost. Under the terms of the agreement, we have agreed to pay total consideration of approximately $2.6 billion, net of cash and  marketable securities, to acquire Acacia. The acquisition is expected to close during the first half of fiscal 2021, subject to  customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. Upon close of the acquisition, revenue from Acacia will be included in  our Infrastructure Platforms product category. On August 7, 2020, we completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, Inc. (“ThousandEyes”), a privately-held company.  ThousandEyes’ Internet and Cloud intelligence platform delivers deep visibility and insights into the digital delivery of  applications and services over the internet. We expect that most of the purchase price for the acquisition of ThousandEyes will  be allocated to goodwill and purchased intangible assets. The financial statement impact of this acquisition will not have a  material impact to our consolidated financial statements. Total transaction costs related to our acquisition and divestiture activities during fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $21 million, $21  million, and $41 million, respectively. These transaction costs were expensed as incurred in G&A expenses in the Consolidated  Statements of Operations. The goodwill generated from our acquisitions completed during fiscal 2020 is primarily related to expected synergies. The  goodwill is generally not deductible for income tax purposes.

Restructuring and Other Charges In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated a restructuring plan (the “Fiscal 2021 Plan”), which includes a voluntary early  retirement program, in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas with estimated  pretax charges of approximately $900 million. These aggregate pretax charges will be primarily cash-based and will consist  of severance and other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. We expect the plan to be substantially completed in  fiscal 2021. We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2020 (the “Fiscal 2020 Plan”) in order to realign the organization and enable  further investment in key priority areas. The total pretax charges are estimated to be approximately $300 million. These  aggregate pretax charges related to the Fiscal 2020 Plan are primarily cash-based and consist of employee severance and other  one-time termination benefits, and other costs. In connection with the Fiscal 2020 Plan, we incurred charges of $255 million  during fiscal 2020. We expect the Fiscal 2020 Plan to be substantially completed in fiscal 2021. In prior years, we initiated restructuring plans in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority  areas. The aggregate pretax charges related to these plans were primarily cash-based and consisted of employee severance and  other one-time termination benefits, and other associated costs. These plans have been completed.

We expect approximately 54% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next year. As of July 27, 2019, the aggregate  amount of RPO was comprised of $18.5 billion of deferred revenue and $6.8 billion of unbilled contract revenue.

We provide leasing of our equipment and  complementary third-party products primarily through our channel partners and distributors, for which the income arising  from these leases is recognized through interest income. Interest income for fiscal 2020 was $94 million and was included  in interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The net investment of our lease receivables is measured at  the commencement date as the gross lease receivable, residual value less unearned income and allowance for credit loss. For  additional information, see Note 9. As of July 25, 2020, our operating lease right-of-use assets were $921 million and were recorded in other assets, and our  operating lease liabilities were $1.0 billion, of which $341 million was included in other current liabilities and $661 million was  included in other long-term liabilities.

Leases (a) Lessee Arrangements We provide financing of certain equipment through operating leases, and the amounts are included in property and equipment  in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts relating to equipment on operating lease assets held by Cisco and the associated  accumulated depreciation are summarized as follows (in millions): 9.  Financing Receivables (a) Financing Receivables Financing receivables primarily consist of lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables  represent sales-type leases resulting from the sale of Cisco’s and complementary third-party products and are typically  collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years  on average. Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services, which  may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.  Loan receivables have terms of three years on average. Financed service contracts include financing receivables related to  technical support and advanced services. Revenue related to the technical support services is typically deferred and included in  deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed, which  typically ranges from one to three years.

The portfolio segment is based on the types of financing offered by us to our customers, which consist of  the following: lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts. Our internal credit risk ratings of 1 through 4 correspond to investment-grade ratings, while credit risk ratings of 5 and 6  correspond to non-investment grade ratings. Credit risk ratings of 7 and higher correspond to substandard ratings. Past due financing receivables are those that are 31 days or more past due according to their contractual payment terms. The data  in the preceding tables is presented by contract, and the aging classification of each contract is based on the oldest outstanding  receivable, and therefore past due amounts also include unbilled and current receivables within the same contract. As of July 25, 2020, we had financing receivables of $67 million, net of unbilled or current receivables, that were greater than  120 days plus past due but remained on accrual status as they are well secured and in the process of collection. Such balance  was $215 million as of July 27, 2019.

In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers.  These privately held companies and customers are evaluated for consolidation under the variable interest or voting interest entity  models. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and our customer financings, and  have determined that as of July 25, 2020, there were no significant variable interest or voting interest entities required to be  consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of July 25, 2020, the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $1.3 billion. $0.7 billion of such  investments are considered to be in variable interest entities which are unconsolidated. We have total funding commitments of  $0.3 billion related to these privately held investments, some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon  milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The carrying value of these investments and the additional  funding commitments collectively represent our maximum exposure related to these privately held investments.

Level 2  available-for-sale debt investments are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices  that are corroborated by observable market data. Our derivative instruments are primarily classified as Level 2, as they are not  actively traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. We did not have any transfers between  Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the periods presented. Level 3 assets include certain derivative instruments,  the values of which are determined based on discounted cash flow models using inputs that we could not corroborate with  market data. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities recorded to fair value on a non-recurring basis is adjusted for  observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. These securities are classified as  Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction  price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs such as volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value for purchased intangible assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis was categorized as Level 3 due to  the use of significant unobservable inputs in the valuation. Significant unobservable inputs that were used included expected  revenues and net income related to the assets and the expected life of the assets. The difference between the estimated fair value  and the carrying value of the assets was recorded as an impairment charge, which was included in product cost of sales and  operating expenses as applicable. The remaining carrying value of the specific purchased intangible assets that were impaired  were zero as of July 25, 2020. The fair value of property held for sale was measured with the assistance of third-party valuation models, which used discounted  cash flow techniques as part of their analysis. The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3, as significant unobservable  inputs were used in the valuation report. The impairment charges as a result of the valuations, which represented the difference  between the fair value less cost to sell and the carrying amount of the assets held for sale, were included in restructuring and  other charges. We recognized an impairment charge of $65 million during fiscal 2020 and the remaining carrying value of the  property held for sale that was impaired was $9 million as of July 25, 2020.

We use the  proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes. The effective rates for the short- and long-term debt include the interest on the notes, the accretion of the discount, the issuance  costs, and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The fair value of our short-term loan receivables and financed service contracts approximates their carrying value due to their  short duration. The aggregate carrying value of our long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts as of July 25, 2020  and July 27, 2019 was $4.5 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our long-term loan receivables and  financed service contracts approximates their carrying value. We use significant unobservable inputs in determining discounted  cash flows to estimate the fair value of our long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts, and therefore they are  categorized as Level 3. As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, the estimated fair value of our short-term debt approximates its carrying value due to the  short maturities. As of July 25, 2020, the fair value of our senior notes and other long-term debt was $17.4 billion, with a carrying  amount of $14.6 billion. This compares to a fair value of $22.1 billion and a carrying amount of $20.5 billion as of July 27, 2019.  The fair value of the senior notes and other long-term debt was determined based on observable market prices in a less active  market and was categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

These swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the fixed-rate notes to  floating interest rates based on the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The gains and losses related to changes in the fair  value of the interest rate swaps substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are  attributable to the changes in market interest rates. For additional information, see Note 13. Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes. Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable by  us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The senior notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes that have been  issued in the future pursuant to our short-term debt financing program, as discussed above under “(a) Short-Term Debt.” As of  July 25, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes  in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the  counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting our  counterparties to major financial institutions. In addition, the potential risk of loss with any one counterparty resulting from this  type of credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect material losses as a result of defaults by counterparties. On May 15, 2020, we entered into a 364-day credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $2.75 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 14, 2021. The credit agreement is structured as an  amendment and restatement of our five-year credit facility which would have terminated on May 15, 2020, the end of its  five-year term. As of July 25, 2020, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants,  and we had not borrowed any funds under the credit facility. Any advances under the credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either  (i) the highest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50%, (b) Bank of America’s “prime rate” as announced from time to time, or  (c) LIBOR, or a comparable or successor rate that is approved by the Administrative Agent (“Eurocurrency Rate”), for an interest  period of one-month plus 1.00%, or (ii) the Eurocurrency Rate, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as  published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the  Eurocurrency Rate be less than 0.25%. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders  not currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion.  The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as  defined in the agreement.

The effect on the Consolidated Statements of Operations of derivative instruments designated as fair value and cash flow hedges  is summarized as follows (in millions): Interest Rate Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges, Long-Term Debt We hold interest rate swaps designated as fair value  hedges related to fixed-rate senior notes that are due in fiscal 2021 through 2025. Under these interest rate swaps, we receive  fixed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points. The effect of such  swaps is to convert the fixed interest rates of the senior fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on LIBOR. The gains  and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest expense and substantially offset  changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates. We present our derivative instruments at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, our master netting  and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are  designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, the  potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the derivative contracts would be a reduction to both derivative assets  and derivative liabilities of $10 million and $13 million, respectively. To further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby  cash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument. Under these  collateral security arrangements, the net cash collateral received as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019 was $173 million and  $76 million, respectively. Including the effects of collateral, this results in a net derivative asset of $8 million and $2 million as  of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency  exchange rates. To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts. We do not  enter into such contracts for speculative purposes. We hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain revenues, operating expenses and service cost of sales  with currency options and forward contracts. These currency options and forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges,  generally have maturities of less than 24 months. The derivative instrument’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of  AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. During the fiscal years presented,  we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur. We enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on  assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, including long-term customer financings, investments, and payables.  These derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income  (loss), net, and substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of intercompany balances or other  current assets, investments, or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity. We hedge certain net investments in our foreign operations with forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency  fluctuations on our net investment in those foreign subsidiaries. These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up  to six months.

We also have certain funding commitments, primarily related to our non-marketable equity and other investments, some of  which are based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand.  The funding commitments were $0.3 billion as of each of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services  for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate  component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory  based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. A significant portion of our reported  purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. Certain  of these purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term pricing  for certain product components for multi-year periods. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel,  reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of July 25, 2020 and  July 27, 2019, we had total purchase commitments for inventory of $4.4 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future  demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, the  liability for these purchase commitments was $141 million and $129 million, respectively, and was included in other current  liabilities. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was  $139 million, $95 million, and $105 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of  certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or upon the continued employment with Cisco of  certain employees of the acquired entities. We may hold marketable equity securities in our portfolio that are subject to price risk. To diversify our overall portfolio, we also  hold equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. The change in the fair value of each of these investment  types are included in other income (loss), net. We are also exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees.  Although not designated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this  exposure and offset the related compensation expense. 14.

Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to  five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. In the ordinary course of business, we provide financing guarantees for various third-party financing arrangements extended  to channel partners and end-user customers. Payments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the  periods presented. Channel Partner Financing Guarantees We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners,  consisting of revolving short-term financing, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. During fiscal 2020,  we expanded the payment terms on certain of our channel partner financing programs by 30 days in response to the COVID-19  pandemic environment. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners,  and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The volume of channel partner financing was $26.9 billion,  $29.6 billion, and $28.2 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The balance of the channel partner financing subject  to guarantees was $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively. End-User Financing Guarantees We also provide financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end- user customers related to leases and loans, which typically have terms of up to three years. The volume of financing provided by  third parties for leases and loans as to which we had provided guarantees was $9 million, $14 million, and $35 million in fiscal  2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

We have agreed to indemnify against losses arising from a breach of representations or  covenants or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit  the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”), which acquired Time Warner Cable (“TWC”) in May 2016, is seeking indemnification  from us for a final judgment obtained by Sprint Communications Company, L.P. (“Sprint”) against TWC in federal court  in Kansas. Sprint sought monetary damages, alleging that TWC infringed certain Sprint patents by offering VoIP telephone  services utilizing products provided by us generally in combination with those of other manufacturers. Following a trial on  March 3, 2017, a jury in Kansas found that TWC willfully infringed five Sprint patents and awarded Sprint $139.8 million in  damages. The Court awarded Sprint pre and post judgment interest of approximately $10 million and denied TWC’s post-trial  motions and appeals. Charter reported that it paid the judgment in full. At this time, we are working with Charter to calculate  the correct amount of indemnification. We do not believe that our indemnity obligations under our agreement will be material. We also have been asked to indemnify certain of our service provider customers that have been subject to patent infringement  claims asserted by Chanbond, LLC (“Chanbond”) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on  September 21, 2015. Chanbond alleges that 13 service provider companies, including among others, Comcast Corporation,  Charter Communications, Inc. (“Charter”), Time Warner Cable, Inc. (subsequently acquired by Charter), Cox Communications,  Inc. (“Cox”), and Cablevision Systems Corporation, infringe three patents by providing high speed cable internet services to their  customers utilizing cable modems and cable modem termination systems, consistent with the DOCSIS 3.0 standard, provided by Brazil Brazilian authorities have investigated our Brazilian subsidiary and certain of its former employees, as well as a Brazilian  importer of our products, and its affiliates and employees, relating to alleged evasion of import taxes and alleged improper  transactions involving the subsidiary and the importer. Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian  subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. In addition to  claims asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years, tax authorities from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo  have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years. SRI International On September 4, 2013, SRI International, Inc. (“SRI”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the  U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, accusing our products and services in the area of network intrusion detection of  infringing two U.S. patents. SRI sought monetary damages of at least a reasonable royalty and enhanced damages. The trial started  on May 2, 2016, and, on May 12, 2016, the jury returned a verdict finding willful infringement. The jury awarded SRI damages of  $23.7 million. On May 25, 2017, the District Court awarded SRI enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees, entered judgment in the  new amount of $57.0 million, and ordered an ongoing royalty of 3.5% through the expiration of the patents in 2018. We appealed to  the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on various grounds, and after various proceedings, on July 12, 2019, the  Federal Circuit vacated the enhanced damages award; vacated and remanded in part the willful infringement finding; vacated and  remanded the attorneys’ fees award for further proceedings; and affirmed the District Court’s other findings. On April 1, 2020, the  District Court issued a final judgment on the remanded issues, finding no evidence of willful infringement and reinstating the $8  million award of attorneys’ fees. SRI appealed the judgment of no willful infringement to the Federal Circuit on April 3, 2020, and  Cisco filed a cross-appeal on the attorneys’ fees award on April 9, 2020. Cisco has paid SRI $28.1 million, representing the portion  of the judgment that the Federal Circuit previously affirmed, plus interest and royalties on post-verdict sales. While the remaining  proceedings may result in an additional loss, we do not expect it to be material. Centripetal On February 13, 2018, Centripetal Networks, Inc. (“Centripetal”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in  the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that several Cisco products and services (including Cisco’s  Catalyst switches, ASR and ISR series routers, ASAs with FirePOWER services, and Stealthwatch products) infringe eleven  Centripetal patents. Cisco thereafter petitioned the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent and  Trademark Office to review the validity of nine of the asserted patents. The PTAB instituted inter partes review proceedings (“IPR  Proceedings”) on six asserted patents and certain claims of another asserted patent. The PTAB has issued Final Written Decisions  for seven patents in the instituted IPR Proceedings, and all claims of five patents have been found unpatentable and several of the During the second quarter of fiscal 2020, $0.8 billion of penalty and interest asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities  against our Brazilian subsidiary on the theory of joint liability was dismissed on its merits. The asserted claims by Brazilian  federal tax authorities that remain are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the tax authorities from  the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total remaining asserted claims by Brazilian state and  federal tax authorities aggregate to $155 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $756 million for interest, and  $383 million for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of July 25, 2020. We have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the remaining asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary  are without merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability,  due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint  liability with the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary  and are unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. us and other manufacturers generally used in combination with each other. Chanbond seeks monetary damages. On July 15, 2020,  the Court vacated the August 19, 2020 trial date for Chanbond’s case against Cox and has not yet set a new trial date. The other  cases against the remaining service provider defendants also have not yet been set for trial. We believe that the service provider  defendants have strong non-infringement, invalidity and other defenses. Due to uncertainties surrounding the litigation processes,  we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of the cases at this time, but should Chanbond prevail in its cases against  the service provider defendants, we do not believe that any potential indemnity liability would be material. During fiscal 2018, we recorded legal and indemnification settlement charges of $127 million to product cost of sales related to  prior indemnification matters resolved in fiscal 2018. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our Amended and Restated  Bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to uncertainties in the  litigation process, coordination with other suppliers and the defendants in these cases, and the unique facts and circumstances  involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a material effect  on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. Finjan On January 6, 2017, Finjan, Inc. (“Finjan”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court  for the Northern District of California, seeking injunctive relief and damages, including enhanced damages for allegations of  willful infringement. Finjan alleges that Cisco’s AMP and ThreatGrid products and the URL rewrite feature of Cisco’s ESA  Outbreak Filter product infringe five patents, four of which have expired. Finjan has conceded that they are not entitled to any  pre-suit damages, accordingly it seeks approximately three weeks of damages for the alleged infringement of the 8,677,494 and  6,154,844 patents, approximately ten months of damages for the 6,804,780 patent, approximately three years of damages for  the 7,647,633 patent, and approximately three-and-a-half years of past damages for the 8,141,154 patent and an ongoing royalty  until its expiration on December 12, 2025. The case is currently set for jury trial starting October 19, 2020. While we believe  that we have strong non-infringement arguments, that the patents are invalid, that Finjan’s damages theories are not supported  by prevailing law and that Finjan will not be able to meet its burden required for injunctive relief, we are unable to reasonably  estimate the ultimate outcome of this litigation at this time due to uncertainties in the litigation processes. If we do not prevail  in the District Court, we believe that any damages ultimately assessed would not be material. In addition, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including  intellectual property litigation. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not expect that the  ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of  operations, or cash flows. For additional information regarding intellectual property litigation, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors-We may be found to  infringe on intellectual property rights of others” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. claims of the other two patents have been found unpatentable. Starting on May 6, 2020 and concluding on June 25, 2020, the  District Court conducted a bench trial by videoconference on the claims in the five patents not subject to the IPR Proceedings,  including claims in three for which the PTAB declined to institute IPR Proceedings. Centripetal seeks damages, enhanced  damages for willful infringement, and broad injunctive relief. While the trial result is uncertain, we believe that a District  Court finding of validity and infringement, finding of willfulness, award of damages including any enhancement, and/or entry  of injunctive relief are not supported by either the law or the evidence presented at trial. We intend to appeal any adverse  outcome to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and we believe that any relief ultimately awarded would  not be material. On April 29, 2020 and April 30, 2020, Centripetal submitted complaints in the District Court of Dusseldorf  in Germany against Cisco Systems GmbH and Cisco Systems, Inc., asserting three European patents seeking both injunctive  relief and damages. Two of the three European patents are counterparts to two U.S. patents Centripetal asserted against us  in the U.S. District Court proceedings, one of which has been invalidated by the PTAB. We are currently assessing the cases  filed in Germany. Due to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation processes in the U.S. and Europe, however, we are unable to  reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of the cases at this time. Oyster Optics On November 24, 2016, Oyster Optics, LLC (“Oyster”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S.  District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. Oyster alleged that certain Cisco ONS 15454 and NCS 2000 line cards infringe  U.S. Patent No. 7,620,327 (“the ‘327 Patent”). Oyster sought monetary damages. Oyster also had filed infringement claims  based on the ‘327 Patent against other defendants, including ZTE, Nokia, NEC, Infinera, Huawei, Ciena, Alcatel-Lucent, and  Fujitsu, and the District Court consolidated the cases alleging infringement of the ‘327 Patent. Oyster’s cases against some of  the defendants were resolved. The District Court vacated the November 4, 2018 trial date set for Oyster’s claims against Cisco  and one other remaining defendant, pending resolution of Oyster’s December 6, 2018 appeal of the District Court’s summary  judgment ruling dismissing certain of Oyster’s claims. On May 8, 2020, the Federal Circuit affirmed the District Court’s  summary judgment ruling. On June 18, 2020, Oyster dismissed its case against us based on the ‘327 Patent with prejudice. Stock Incentive Plan Program Description As of July 25, 2020, we had one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan  (the “2005 Plan”). In addition, we have, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based  awards granted under stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement thereof.  Share-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them  to remain with Cisco. The number and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, operating results of  Cisco, government regulations, and other factors. Our primary stock incentive plan is summarized as follows: 2005 Plan The 2005 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock grants, stock units and stock appreciation rights (SARs), the  vesting of which may be time-based or upon satisfaction of performance goals, or both, and/or other conditions. Employees (including  employee directors and executive officers) and consultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates and non-employee directors of  Cisco are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. As of July 25, 2020, the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2005 Plan  over its term was 694 million shares. The 2005 Plan may be terminated by the Board of Directors at any time and for any reason, and  is currently set to terminate at the 2021 Annual Meeting unless re-adopted or extended by the shareholders prior to or on such date. Under the terms of our Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences, and terms of our  authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock. Employee Benefit Plans (a) Employee Stock Incentive Plans Under the 2005 Plan’s share reserve feature, a distinction is made between the number of shares in the reserve attributable to (i)  stock options and SARs and (ii) “full value” awards (i.e., stock grants and stock units). Shares issued as stock grants, pursuant to  stock units or pursuant to the settlement of dividend equivalents are counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005  Plan on a 1.5-to-1 ratio. For each share awarded as restricted stock or a restricted stock unit award under the 2005 Plan, 1.5 shares  was deducted from the available share-based award balance. For restricted stock units that were awarded with vesting contingent  upon the achievement of future financial performance or market-based metrics, the maximum awards that can be achieved upon  full vesting of such awards. If awards issued under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or terminated for any reason before being exercised  or settled, then the shares underlying such awards, plus the number of additional shares, if any, that counted against shares available There were no stock repurchases pending settlement as of July 25, 2020. There were $40 million and $180 million in stock  repurchases that were pending settlement as of July 27, 2019 and July 28, 2018, respectively. The purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to shareholders’ equity. We are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings or an increase to  accumulated deficit and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital.

Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. (b) Stock Repurchase Program In September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of July 25, 2020, the remaining authorized  amount for stock repurchases under this program, including the additional authorization, is approximately $10.8 billion, with  no termination date. Shareholders’ Equity (a) Cash Dividends on Shares of Common Stock As of July 25, 2020, the total compensation cost related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized was $3.9 billion,  which is expected to be recognized over approximately 2.7 years on a weighted-average basis.

As of July 25, 2020, 183 million shares were authorized for future grant under  the 2005 Plan. Share-based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses for stock options, stock purchase rights, restricted stock, and  RSUs granted to employees. The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense (in millions): We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which 721.4 million shares of our common stock have been reserved for  issuance as of July 25, 2020. Eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering period, which consists of four  consecutive 6-month purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited amount of shares of our stock at a discount of up to  15% of the lesser of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of each 6-month purchase period. The  Employee Stock Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on the earlier of (i) January 3, 2030 and (ii) the date on which all shares  available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are sold pursuant to exercised purchase rights. We issued 18  million, 19 million, and 22 million shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.  As of July 25, 2020, 141 million shares were available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The PRSUs granted during the fiscal years presented are contingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics,  our comparative market-based returns, or the achievement of financial and non-financial operating goals. For the awards based  on financial performance metrics or comparative market-based returns, generally 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on the  average of annual operating cash flow and earnings per share goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year over a  three-year performance period. Generally, the remaining 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on our TSR measured against  the benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same period. Each PRSU recipient could vest in 0% to 150% of the target shares  granted contingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics or our comparative market-based returns, and 0%  to 100% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of non-financial operating goals. The valuation of employee stock purchase rights and the related assumptions are for the employee stock purchases made during  the respective fiscal years. We used third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in our Black-Scholes model. We are responsible for  determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share-based payment awards. We used the implied volatility for traded options (with contract terms corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock  purchase rights) on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. The implied volatility  is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon  observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock purchase rights. The dividend yield assumption is based  on the history and expectation of dividend payouts at the grant date.

On the date of grant, we estimated the fair value of the total shareholder return (TSR) component of the PRSUs using  a Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions for the valuation of time-based RSUs and PRSUs are summarized as follows: We sponsor the Cisco Systems, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) to provide retirement benefits for our employees. As allowed under  Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary contributions and after-tax contributions  for eligible employees. The Plan allows employees to contribute up to 75% of their annual eligible earnings to the Plan on a  pretax and after-tax basis, including Roth contributions. Employee contributions are limited to a maximum annual amount as  set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code. We match pretax and Roth employee contributions up to 100% of the first 4.5%  of eligible earnings that are contributed by employees. Therefore, the maximum matching contribution that we may allocate  to each participant’s account will not exceed $12,825 for the 2020 calendar year due to the $285,000 annual limit on eligible  earnings imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. All matching contributions vest immediately. Our matching contributions to  the Plan totaled $295 million, $283 million, and $269 million in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Plan allows employees who meet the age requirements and reach the Plan contribution limits to make catch-up contributions  (pretax or Roth) not to exceed the lesser of 75% of their annual eligible earnings or the limit set forth in the Internal Revenue Code.  Catch-up contributions are not eligible for matching contributions. In addition, the Plan provides for discretionary profit-sharing  contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. Such contributions to the Plan are allocated among eligible participants  in the proportion of their salaries to the total salaries of all participants. There were no discretionary profit-sharing contributions  made in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018. We also sponsor other 401(k) plans as a result of acquisitions of other companies. Our contributions to these plans were not  material to Cisco on either an individual or aggregate basis for any of the fiscal years presented. The Cisco Systems, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”), a nonqualified deferred compensation  plan, became effective in 2007. As required by applicable law, participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan is limited to  a select group of our management employees. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, which is an unfunded and unsecured  deferred compensation arrangement, a participant may elect to defer base salary, bonus, and/or commissions, pursuant to  such rules as may be established by Cisco, up to the maximum percentages for each deferral election as described in the  plan. We may also, at our discretion, make a matching contribution to the employee under the Deferred Compensation Plan.  A matching contribution equal to 4.5% of eligible compensation in excess of the Internal Revenue Code limit for qualified plans  for calendar year 2020 that is deferred by participants under the Deferred Compensation Plan (with a $1.5 million cap on eligible  compensation) will be made to eligible participants’ accounts at the end of calendar year 2020. The total deferred compensation  liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan, together with deferred compensation plans assumed from acquired companies,  was approximately $704 million and $678 million as of July 25, 2020 and July 27, 2019, respectively, and was recorded primarily  in other long-term liabilities.

During fiscal 2020, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Cisco settled all outstanding items related to the audit of our federal  income tax returns for the fiscal year ended July 30, 2011 through July 27, 2013. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a  net benefit to the provision for income taxes of $102 million, which included a reduction in interest expense of $4 million. We  are no longer subject to U.S. federal tax audit through fiscal 2013. Foreign taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided on a cumulative total of $6.8  billion of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of the end of fiscal 2020.

The  amount of potential unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is approximately $706 million. As a result of certain employment and capital investment actions, our income in certain foreign countries was subject to reduced  tax rates. The tax incentives expired at the end of fiscal 2019. As of the end of fiscal 2019 and 2018, the gross income tax  benefits attributable to tax incentives were estimated to be $0.3 billion and $0.9 billion ($0.08 and $0.19 per diluted share) for  the respective years. The gross income tax benefits were partially offset by accruals of U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings. As of July 25, 2020, $2.2 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if realized. During fiscal  2020, we recognized $104 million of net interest expense and increased our unrecognized tax benefits for prior year tax  positions by $554 million to reflect expected settlement positions in on-going U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax return  examinations. We recognized net interest expense of $30 million and $10 million, respectively, during fiscal 2019 and 2018.  Our net penalty expense for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was not material. Our total accrual for interest and penalties was  $340 million, $220 million, and $180 million as of the end of fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We are no longer subject  to U.S. federal income tax audit for returns covering tax years through fiscal 2013. We are no longer subject to foreign or state  income tax audits for returns covering tax years through fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2008, respectively. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. We  believe it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign, and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.  Specific positions that may be resolved include issues involving transfer pricing and various other matters. We estimate that the  unrecognized tax benefits at July 25, 2020 could be reduced by $150 million in the next 12 months. As of July 25, 2020, our federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $405 million,  $1.2 billion, and $644 million, respectively. A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards relates to acquisitions  and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss  carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2022, and the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire  in fiscal 2021. We have provided a valuation allowance of $98 million for deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating  losses that are not expected to be realized. As of July 25, 2020, our federal, state, and foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately  $10 million, $1.2 billion, and $5 million, respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2021.  The majority of state and foreign tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. We have provided a valuation allowance of  $541 million for deferred tax assets related to state and foreign tax credits that are not expected to be realized. Segment Information and Major Customers We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis consisting of three segments: the Americas,  EMEA, and APJC. Our management makes financial decisions and allocates resources based on the information it receives from  our internal management system. Sales are attributed to a segment based on the ordering location of the customer. We do not  allocate research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to our segments in this internal  management system because management does not include the information in our measurement of the performance of the  operating segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, share- based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments  and restructurings, and certain other charges to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include this  information in our measurement of the performance of the operating segments.

Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive  effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of such equity awards  is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method.

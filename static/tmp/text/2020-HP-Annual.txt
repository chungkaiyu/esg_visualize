HP Inc. 2020 Annual Report & 2021 Proxy Statement Our vision is to create technology that makes life better for  everyone, everywhere — every person, every organization,  and every community around the globe. This motivates us —  inspires us — to do what we do. To make what we make. To  invent, and to reinvent. To engineer experiences that amaze.  We won’t stop pushing ahead, because you won’t stop pushing  ahead. You’re reinventing how you work. How you play. How  you live. With our technology, you’ll reinvent your world. This is our calling. This is a new HP. Keep reinventing. We will one day look back on 2020 as one of the  most difficult years of our lifetimes. The Covid-19  pandemic has caused pain and suffering for so  many, and we have seen stark reminders of the  serious social and environmental challenges  demanding our collective action. Against this backdrop, I’m incredibly proud of  the way our HP team stepped forward to meet  the moment. We showed remarkable agility and resilience –  innovating to meet new customer needs and  accelerating key elements of our strategy. We  stayed true to HP’s values by mobilizing to support  urgent needs in our communities. And we did it all  while delivering strong full-year financial results. For FY20, we grew non-GAAP EPS to $2.28 on  revenue of $56.6 billion. And we returned  $4.1 billion to our shareholders while continuing  to invest in long-term growth opportunities. Notably, we achieved the targets we set in  the fall of 2019. Given the dynamic market  conditions of the past year, that’s an impressive  accomplishment reflecting the power of our  broad and differentiated portfolio, the strength  of our executional muscle, and the continued  progress we’re making against our priorities. We see many attractive opportunities ahead  to build on our success and drive long-term  sustainable growth, fueled by trends that are  reshaping the world around us. For example, the pandemic has fundamentally  changed the concept of work. As hybrid work  becomes the norm, many offices will become  collaboration spaces while a lot of traditional office  work will be done remotely. This will drive the  continued consumerization of corporate IT and a  new wave of innovation – from more versatile and  secure technology and peripherals, to services and  software that enhance the user experience. Our strategy is designed to capitalize on these  shifts by modernizing Personal Systems and  Print experiences and expanding into valuable  adjacencies – and we made good progress  throughout 2020. We launched a wide range For example, together with our partners, we  produced more than 5 million 3D-printed parts for  hospitals using Multi Jet Fusion. That’s just a glimpse  into what’s possible as we create customized end- to-end solutions for vertical markets and enable  more flexible, resilient supply chains. And moving forward, we’re focused on creating  entirely new businesses by leveraging our  vast intellectual property in microfluidics,  which has many potential applications in areas  beyond printing – such as health and wellness.  Our newly formed Strategy & Incubation  organization will lead this important work, with  a focus on driving new sources of growth. Over time, we will build a broader portfolio of  businesses that drives near, medium and long- term value creation and meets a broader set of  customer needs. And to enable all this, we continue to drive  an aggressive, multi-year transformation  agenda focused on strengthening our digital  capabilities and optimizing our cost structure. of personal computing solutions tailored to the  changing ways people live, work, learn and play.  And we leveraged our strength across home  and office printing to create new, cloud-enabled  value propositions like HP+. The pandemic has also fundamentally changed  customer behavior. People increasingly want  to consume as a service. Many have adopted a  digital-first mentality. And they’re looking for  seamless omnichannel experiences spanning  their digital and physical worlds. Here, too, we made major strides forward. We  significantly grew our subscription business, with  Instant Ink surpassing 8 million subscribers. And  we implemented new systems that are making us  more digitally enabled and data driven. As we modernize our core, we also continue to  build new businesses to drive long-term growth  in areas like 3D printing and industrial graphics.  We have a clear strategy to disrupt industries  by creating highly personalized solutions and  accelerating the adoption of digital printing.  And the pandemic has shown the value of the  innovation we’re able to deliver. We implemented new systems and a new  operating model in 2020, while exceeding our  cost savings target for the year. And these remain  priority focus areas moving forward. But it’s not just what we’re doing that gives me  confidence in HP’s future. It’s also how we’re doing it. At a time when trust in institutions is lacking, our  customers are looking for brands they can rely  on to do the right things. That’s why Sustainable  Impact remains at the heart of our strategy. Our success will no longer be defined solely by  the products we make, but also by the progress  we make possible – from addressing systemic  racism to protecting our planet for future  generations. The HP brand will stand for a new  era of opportunity where climate change is  reversed, human rights are universally protected,  and the digital divide eliminated for all. In recent months, HP has been named “America’s  Most Responsible Company” by Newsweek for  the second straight year, one of the top 10 “Best  Managed Companies of 2020” by the Wall Street  Journal, and a member of the Barron’s list of “100  Most Sustainable Companies.” HP has always been home to those who dream of  creating a better future for everyone, everywhere  – then work together to make it a reality. That’s  the mindset that enabled us to deliver on our  commitments last year, and it’s what will lift our  business to new heights in the years to come. Thank you for the confidence you have placed in  HP with your investment. We generated $4.3 billion in net cash provided by operating activities and  $3.9 billion of free cash flow in fiscal 2020. Free cash flow includes net cash  provided by operating activities, net investments for leases of $0.2 billion and  net investments in property, plant and equipment of $0.6 billion. We utilized  approximately $3.1 billion of cash during fiscal 2020 to repurchase approximately  166.5(1) million shares of common stock in the open market. When the value of  these repurchases is combined with the almost $1.0 billion of cash used to pay  dividends, HP returned 105% of its free cash flow to stockholders in fiscal 2020. Advance We continue to advance our leadership in  Personal Systems and Printing. We are creating the next generation of personal  computing experiences by innovating across  hardware, peripherals, services, software and  security to meet customer needs. We are modernizing print experiences by  creating new, cloud-enabled value propositions  and accelerating service-led business models.  Executing on our Strategy and Driving  Financial Returns in Fiscal 2020 The HP of the Future HP’s full year fiscal 2020 financial results reflect the strength of our innovation  and execution and operation excellence as we make progress against creating  multiple value creation engines across our company. Our results in fiscal 2020  also demonstrate our ability to deliver results while investing in our business  for future growth and efficiency opportunities with an increased focus on  returning capital to shareholders. Our foundation is strong, including our  balance sheet, and we have multiple levers to create value for our stockholders.  We are pleased with our full year results despite more challenging industry,  macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics.

We have begun this disruption in areas such as  Graphics and 3D Printing, which together we refer  to as our Industrial businesses that, collectively,  present attractive long-term growth opportunities.  We are creating highly personalized, end-to-end  solutions for specific industry verticals; accelerating  the adoption of digital printing; and creating new  businesses using HP microfluidics technology. From the very early days of HP, this company has pushed past conventional  notions of what’s possible. We have dreamed of creating a better future for  everyone, everywhere – and then worked together to make that future a reality. Today, as we innovate to meet the needs of the changing world around us,  we enter a defining decade for our company. A decade full of opportunity to  advance our leadership in Personal Systems and Print, to disrupt industries  with our technology and IP, and to transform HP for the future.  And we will do it in ways that are aligned with our values – continuing to build  one of the world’s most trusted brands; investing in our culture and talent so  that HP remains a place where great leaders come to learn, lead and thrive;  and making a sustainable impact on the markets and communities we serve. All across our company, we are summoning the creativity, imagination  and determination that has always defined HP at its best – because that’s  ultimately what will lift our business to new heights in the years to come. Transform We continue to transform the way we work as a  company to deliver on our priorities. This includes a new global operating model  that places our teams closer to customers,  and new digital capabilities that enhance our  effectiveness and optimize our cost structure.  We are implementing a multi-year  transformation program that exceeded our cost  savings target for 2020 and will maintain an  aggressive focus on creating value.

In addition, we  introduced a new tooling solution for 3D molded  fiber manufacturing. HP’s corporate governance policies and practices are continuously evolving – from our time as Hewlett- Packard Company to our identity as HP Inc., we have always led by example, adopting changes in line  with our commitment to the highest standards of governance. Stockholder input has been key to our  progression, and as we continue to evolve our corporate governance policies and practices, we will  continue to solicit feedback from our stockholders regarding our governance profile. The following  examples highlight some of the key features of our corporate governance policies and practices, including  updates we have recently made to strengthen our policies and practices: — Our Board continues to believe that it  is in the current best interests of our  stockholders and the Company to have  an independent Chairman. Accordingly,  Chip Bergh has served as our independent  Chairman since July 2017. — Since 2016, our NGSR Committee  has reviewed and discussed our  environmental, sustainability, diversity  and social impact strategy at every regular  meeting of the Committee, providing  valuable advice and insights.

Sustainable Impact is HP’s commitment to create  positive, lasting change for the planet, its people, and our  communities. It is fundamental to our strategy – fueling  our innovation and growth, strengthening our business for  the long term and enabling us to develop and deliver the  best solutions to our customers. Our Sustainable Impact Pillars Our approach covers a broad range of sustainability issues across three pillars:  Planet, People, and Community. We prioritize issues to address based on their relative importance to our culture,  business success and sustainable development. HP is recognized as one of the world’s most  sustainable companies. We gain valuable insight through our regular  engagement with a range of stakeholders—including  employees, investors, suppliers, customers, peer  companies, public policymakers, industry bodies,  nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), sector  experts, and others. These interactions (including our  updated materiality assessment in 2019) build our  collective intelligence, help us prioritize critical issues,  and provide insights on emerging opportunities  and risks. viii www.hpannualmeeting.com BILLION in new sales in 2020 We have set aggressive goals related to several  material topics to manage performance and  drive long-term progress. HP also supports the  United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs), and remains committed to driving  progress on goals that are closely aligned to our  Sustainable Impact strategy. Sustainable Impact serves as a guiding principle  for delivering on our corporate vision—to create  technology that makes life better for everyone,  everywhere. In order to be successful over the  long term, we know that we must not only create  value for our shareholders, but also create a  brighter future for all of our stakeholders. Our governance structure supports this vision.  We embed Sustainable Impact at all levels of the  company, and encourage our executives and all  employees to innovate and drive progress with an  eye toward Sustainable Impact. Our executive leadership team, led by our CEO,  has overall responsibility for Sustainable Impact  as part of our business strategy. All members of  the executive leadership team oversee Sustainable  Impact targets relevant to their organizations.  Annually, executive compensation is tied, in part,  to demonstrating performance against these  environmental and social objectives, including  diversity, equity and inclusion. For more information and details on our efforts,  please view our Sustainable Impact Report at  https://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-information/ sustainable-impact.html The HP Board of Directors’ Nominating,  Governance and Social Responsibility (NGSR)  Committee oversees the company’s policies and  programs relating to global citizenship and the  impact of HP’s operations as well as other legal,  regulatory, and compliance matters.

Also, our HP Racial Equality  and Social Justice Task Force is setting measurable  goals that will drive sustainable impact when it  comes to racial equality. In 2018,  Personal Systems, Print, and 3D Printing  developed and approved their own Sustainable  Impact strategies. These strategies are being  managed and driven by dedicated representatives  within those businesses, who report to executive  leadership on progress. To further embed  Sustainable Impact throughout the company,  starting in 2021, HP’s employees are encouraged  to set annual performance goals related to driving  Sustainable Impact in their roles and on their  teams.

HP’s Response to COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all of us—businesses large and small, local and national governments, families, and individuals—in ways few of us could have imagined. The wellbeing of our employees, partners, customers, and their families is our number one priority, and we have taken a wide range of actions across our business to keep people  safe. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong  focus on employee wellbeing, health and safety. In an effort to keep our employees connected, we focused our efforts in four key areas: Education, Health and Wellbeing, Family  Support and Work Flexibility, and Community. We swiftly took action to protect our people in line with public health guidance — pivoting to work from home, prohibiting business  travel, restricting site access, and implementing enhanced sanitization processes. At the same time, we remain committed to supporting communities around the world. HP and the HP Foundation contributed financial resources to support affected communities. Together  with nonprofit partners, we launched and promoted several initiatives aimed at supporting teachers, students, and school districts through a range of digital and printed educational resources. Contribute 1.5 million employee  volunteering hours by 2025  (cumulative since the beginning  of 2016) Our annual 40 Days of Doing Good campaign takes  place each year in May and early June. In 2019,  2,980 HP employees in 27 countries volunteered  2,150 hours on approximately 200 projects.  Among the many activities were a digital  literacy project. More than 28.7 million  student and adult learners since 2015 Tracy Keogh, HP’s Chief Human Resources Officer, talks with  the Chair of our Board Human Resources and Compensation  Committee, Stephanie Burns, about our executive compensation  program and the Committee’s duties in overseeing the program’s  design and implementation. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee (HRC) consists of Ms. Burns  and four other independent Directors: Ms. Alvarez, Mr. Banerji, Mr. Bergh and  Mr. Mobley. All bring valuable experience and a clear understanding of the role that  appropriate executive compensation plays in ensuring company performance and  stockholder value. Stephanie, so good to have you with us  today. You’ve been a member of the HP  Board since 2015 and have chaired the HRC  since November 2017. Can you talk about  the role the HRC plays in our executive  compensation program? Certainly. The Committee oversees and provides  strategic direction to management regarding  our pay-for-performance program. We set the  CEO’s compensation and review and approve  compensation for the rest of the leadership  team. We also review senior management  selections and oversee succession planning. In carrying out these duties, the Committee  works with its own independent compensation  consultant to help analyze competitive pay  practices and market trends, with a focus  on strengthening the pay-for-performance  relationship and alignment with stockholders. The Committee also gets an update at every  meeting on key people practices and initiatives  happening across HP. This includes everything  from employee engagement to key hires to  company culture, with a special focus on HP’s  Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) agenda, an  area where the Committee is fully engaged and  committed to driving improvements. Can you describe HP’s overall philosophy and  strategy on executive compensation? xii www.hpannualmeeting.com Tracy Keogh (TK): Our compensation program is closely aligned  with HP business goals. It focuses on driving  the right behaviors while helping attract, retain,  and reward the executive team for delivering  long-term value to stockholders. Our pay-for- performance philosophy is the foundation for  all decisions regarding executive compensation,  with a strong bias towards variable pay. Our  program is also designed to facilitate strong  corporate governance. We align executive compensation with shareholder  value through equity-based programs, combined  with shareholder value-based performance  measures (like relative Total Shareholder Return)  and financial performance measures that  executives can control and are closely correlated  with shareholder value over time. Can you describe how you stay connected with  stockholders on compensation? We regularly engage with our stockholders on  a variety of issues, including their views on best  practices in executive compensation. Based on  their feedback, starting in fiscal 2020 we adjusted  our long-term performance-based incentives  (PARSUs) to incorporate three year average EPS  performance with full vesting only after three years  of service and achievement of financial goals.  We also changed relative TSR from a standalone  measure to a “payout modifier” determined based  on three-year performance. These changes will increase focus on strategic performance while  continuing close alignment between shareholder  value creation and real pay delivery. Are there specific elements of our program  that showcase our best practices? HP’s program incorporates many best practices  and we are continuously working to improve.  Some specific elements we believe are best-in- class include:   — We target compensation to approximate  the median level among a group of  relevant peers, and only go above this  level when performance warrants   — We utilize non-discretionary financial  metrics, and specific management objectives  in our annual cash incentive plan, which are  correlated to long-term value creation Thanks for the great overview Stephanie.

We lowered this right from 25% after engaging with our stockholders on what  rights to act outside of the annual meeting they would prefer. — Directors are elected annually by majority vote in uncontested Director elections. — Each Director nominee has agreed to resign from the Board if he or she fails to receive a  majority vote.   — We maintain a close, effective dialogue with our stockholders through an ongoing  stockholder outreach program.   — Non-employee Directors are expected to own Company stock equal to at least five times  their annual cash Board retainer within five years of joining the Board.   — Independent consultant to advise our HRC Committee on executive compensation and  governance matters MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL NO. 2 Ratification of Independent Registered Public  Accounting Firm — The Audit Committee of the Board has selected Ernst & Young LLP to act as HP’s independent  registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending October 31, 2021 and seeks ratification of  the selection. MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL NO. 3 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation  (“Say on Pay” Vote) — Our Board and the Human Resources and Compensation Committee are committed to excellence in  corporate governance and to an executive compensation program that aligns the interests of our  executives with those of our stockholders. To fulfill this mission, we have a pay-for-performance  philosophy that forms the foundation for decisions regarding executive compensation. — Our compensation programs have been structured to balance near-term results with long-term  success, mitigate risks, and enable us to attract, retain, focus, and reward our executive team for  delivering stockholder value. Our executive compensation program incorporates policies and practices designed to be aligned with our pay-for-performance philosophy and  promote responsible pay and governance practices. The majority of target total direct compensation for executives is performance-based as well  as equity-based to align executives’ rewards with sustained stockholder value creation. On average, only 10% of target total direct compensation  for our NEOs is provided in the form of base salary, with approximately 14% provided in the form of annual incentives and the remaining 76%  provided in the form of equity-based long-term incentives. — This stockholder proposal requests that HP’s Board take such steps as may be necessary to permit written  consent by stockholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize  the action at a meeting at which all stockholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. 6 www.hpannualmeeting.com The Board recommends a   vote AGAINST this Proposal   Further information   beginning on page 40.

The Board recommends a  vote FOR this Proposal GAAP Net Revenue      Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Earnings      Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow     $ 56.6  BILLION (as defined on page 50) compared to a  target goal of $59.4 billion under our  annual incentive plan. HP Inc. is a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies,  solutions, and services. We sell to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses and large enterprises, including customers in  the government, health, and education sectors. We have three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments.  The Personal Systems segment offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook PCs, workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility  devices, retail POS systems, displays and other related accessories, software, support, and services. The Printing segment provides consumer and  commercial printer hardware, supplies, solutions and services, as well as scanning devices. Corporate Investments include HP Labs and certain  business incubation and investment projects. Our continued efforts resulted in the following accomplishments:   — Revenues declined only 3.6% from the prior year despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic — Delivered revenue growth and operating margin expansion in Personal Systems, driven by innovation, demand from notebooks and focus on  strategic growth areas such as Service, Premium and Gaming.   — Executed effectively in Printing with growth in areas such as home printing and Instant Ink as we continued to evolve our print business  models with a drive toward services and a rebalance of profitability between hardware and supplies.   — Strengthened our position in 3D printing as we continue to shift our focus toward more end-to-end solutions and higher-value applications  through innovation and extending our product portfolio with the introduction of molded fiber capabilities.   — Generated $4.3 billion in cash flow from operations and returned over $4.1 billion of capital to stockholders in the form of dividends and  share repurchases. The global-macroeconomic and foreign-currency environment was very challenging in fiscal 2020. Nevertheless, as illustrated below for the three key  financial measures used to fund our annual pay-for-performance incentive awards, we exceeded one of our three goals reflected in our business plan. As a company, we are delivering on our commitments to our stockholders and optimizing the business to consistently deliver long-term,  sustainable value. We continue to focus on profitable value capture as we seek to advance our leadership position in Personal Systems and  Printing and invest in adjacencies where we can disrupt with innovation and new business models like Graphics and 3D & Digital Manufacturing.  At the same time, we are focused on transforming the way we work by increasing productivity and taking cost out of the business. We have an  incredible channel network, passionate employees and a culture committed to keep reinventing. And just as importantly, we are winning the right  way with a sustainable impact framework focused on people, the planet and the communities in which we operate. $ 3.6  BILLION (as defined on page 50) compared to a  target goal of $3.7 billion under our annual  incentive plan. 6.9  PERCENT (as a percentage of revenue; as defined  on page 50) compared to a target goal of  5.9% under our annual incentive plan. At HP, we believe in the power of technology to enable people and communities to change the world for the better. Sustainable impact is  fundamental to our strategy – fueling our innovation and growth, strengthening our business for the long term and enabling us to develop and  deliver the best solutions to our customers. Our approach covers a broad range of sustainability issues across three pillars: Planet, People and Community. We prioritize issues to address  based on their relative importance to our culture, business success and sustainable development. For additional information regarding our  approach to sustainability and our sustainability goals, please see our annual Sustainable Impact Report, which is available on our website. We aim to transform our entire business to drive a more efficient, circular, and low-carbon economy, while enabling our customers to invent the  future through a sustainable portfolio of products and services. We continue to make significant progress towards our goals, including: — We are more than halfway to achieving our science-based goal of reducing product use greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 30% by 2025  and we were the only technology company globally to receive a CDP Triple A rating from CDP for climate, forests and water, and the only  North American company to receive a Triple A rating two years in a row. — Through May 2020, we sourced more than 1.7 million pounds of ocean-bound plastic for use in our products, and we are on track with our  plans to increase recycled plastic content in our print and personal systems products to 30% by 2025.   — We have a goal of zero deforestation in HP branded paper and packaging and improving the management of nearly 200,000 acres (over  80,000 hectares) of forests in Brazil and China, an area equivalent to the size of New York City, by the end of calendar year 2024. We champion dignity, respect and empowerment for the people with whom we work, and strive to respect human rights and embed diversity,  equity and inclusion in everything we do. We are committed to doing our part to enable all people who help bring our products to market to thrive  at work, at home and in their communities.   — Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top and flows throughout the entire organization. In 2020, we established  a Global Diversity Advisory Board and a Task Force on Racial Equality and Social Injustice to advance our commitments to diversity, equity  and inclusion. — We have committed to doubling the number of Black and African American executives by 2025. — We champion equal and human rights for everyone we work with so that business and society can thrive. In 2020, we published our  inaugural Human Rights Progress Report to drive transparency and long-term community impact. For additional information regarding HP’s human capital management, please refer to “Our Approach to Human Capital Management” on page 32. We contribute our technology, time and resources to catalyze positive change in communities where we live, work and do business. We aim to  unlock educational and economic opportunity through the power of technology and improve the vitality and resilience of our local communities.   — From 2015 to 2019, we have reached more than 28 million students, teachers, and adult learners through our educational programs and  partnerships—and we are tracking toward our goal of enabling better learning outcomes for 100 million people by 2025.   — In 2020, we supported distance learning during the COVID-19 pandemic through programs such as BeOnline; Print; Play & Learn; HP Turn to  Learn; and HP Refresh. — HP employees contributed 429,000 total volunteer hours across 51 countries from 2016 through 2019. 8 www.hpannualmeeting.com The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all of us—businesses large and small, local and national governments, families, and  individuals—in ways few of us could have imagined. As the pandemic spread globally, we swiftly took action to support our employees,  customers, partners and communities. Our employees. The unique challenges of 2020 have only underscored the importance of positioning our employees to excel. Since the  onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal  responsibilities, with a strong focus on employee wellbeing, health and safety. In an effort to keep our employees connected, we focused  our efforts in four key areas: Education, Health and Wellbeing, Family Support and Work Flexibility, and Community. As soon as COVID-19 started to take hold on a global scale, HP took swift action to protect our people in line with public health guidance—  pivoting to work from home, prohibiting business travel, restricting site access, and implementing enhanced sanitization processes. In  the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we implemented a one-time work-from-home equipment reimbursement program for employees  to improve their home workspaces. For those in manufacturing and other critical functions that could not transition to a remote working  model, we quickly implemented safety and hygiene training and protocols, such as physical distancing, safety gear mandates, site  visitor restrictions, alternate staffing shifts, and enhanced cleaning and sanitization practices, to protect the employees in our labs and  manufacturing and production facilities. Our customers and partners. We have taken meaningful actions to remain close to our customers and partners, including implementing a  variety of relief initiatives to help them navigate their operational and financial challenges. Our community. We are also putting our resources behind efforts to support local communities and to assist in the public health  response. We created a Summer Scholars program that enabled university students to continue to learn and develop. We have donated  millions of dollars in technology and support across Personal Systems and Printing to help students, families, and communities, including  hospitals in affected areas. The role of our Board and management. The Board has been and remains highly engaged with management regarding the impact of the  COVID-19 pandemic and the company’s response and plans. Management has regularly held informational calls with Board members  covering employees and operations, financial impact, supply chain disruptions, and related legal and regulatory matters. Management  also is engaged with the Board on identifying and addressing ongoing strategic risks and opportunities arising out of the COVID-19  pandemic. Additionally, in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Lores agreed to a 25% reduction in paid base salary and  members of the Executive Leadership team, including the NEOs, agreed to 15% reductions in their paid base salaries, respectively, for  the period from July 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020. The Board also approved a reduction of 25% of the annual cash retainer paid  to non-employee Directors for their service from June 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020. In response to the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic, Board members have also waived their fees from additional Board meetings. HP donated these fees totaling $326,000 to the  HP Employee Relief Fund. HP’s Board considers the appropriate format  of the meeting on an annual basis. HP’s  current virtual format allows stockholders  to submit questions and comments in our  stockholder forum both before and during  the meeting. We respond to all stockholder  submissions received through the forum in  writing on our investor relations website.  The virtual meeting format allows our  stockholders to engage with us no matter  where they live in the world and is accessible  and available on any internet-connected  device, be it a phone, a tablet, or a computer.  We are able to reach a base of stockholders  that is broader than just those who can  travel to an in-person meeting, particularly in  light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The virtual  meeting gives us the opportunity to respond  in thoughtful detail to every question our  stockholders may have, rather than just the  limited number of questions stockholders  are able to ask at in-person meetings, which  are answered on the fly. All of these benefits  of a virtual meeting allow our stockholders  to have truly robust engagement with HP. Stockholders can access our pre-meeting  forum, where you can submit questions  in advance of the annual meeting, by  visiting our annual meeting website. All  questions received, both during and prior to  the meeting, are presented as submitted,  uncensored and unedited except for  certain personal details for data protection  purposes. If we receive substantially similar  questions, we will group such questions  together and provide a single response to  avoid repetition. We will have technicians ready to assist  you with any technical difficulties you  may have accessing the virtual meeting.

Management Proposal No. 1 Election of Directors  12 Management Proposal No. 2 Ratification of Independent  Registered Public Accounting Firm  40 Management Proposal No. 3 Advisory Vote to Approve  Executive Compensation  42 T1 MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL NO. 1 Election of Directors The Board of Directors of HP Inc. (the “Board”) currently consists of 13 Directors. On the recommendation of the Nominating, Governance and  Social Responsibility (“NGSR”) Committee, the Board has nominated the 11 persons named below for election as Directors this year, each to serve  for a one-year term and until the Director’s successor is elected and qualified or, if earlier, until his or her resignation or removal. Matsuoka  and Mr. Mobley are not standing for re-election at this annual meeting. As a result, Ms. Matsuoka and Mr. Mobley will each step down from the  Board and the size of the Board will be reduced to 11 directors, effective at the annual meeting. Vote Required Each Director nominee who receives more “FOR” votes than “AGAINST” votes representing shares of HP common stock present in person or  represented by proxy and entitled to be voted at the annual meeting will be elected. If you sign your proxy card but do not give instructions with respect to voting for Directors, your shares will be voted by Enrique Lores and  Harvey Anderson, as proxy holders, FOR the election of all 11 Board nominees. If you wish to give specific instructions with respect to voting  for Directors, you may do so by indicating your instructions when you vote via Internet or by telephone, or on your proxy card or voting  instruction card. We have adopted a policy whereby any incumbent Director nominee who receives a greater number of votes “AGAINST” his or her election than  votes “FOR” such election will tender his or her offer of resignation for consideration by the NGSR Committee. The NGSR Committee will then  make a recommendation to the Board regarding the appropriate response to such an offer of resignation. Our Directors bring an extraordinary wealth of skills and backgrounds to the Board. From Subra Suresh, an acclaimed scientist whose background  in microfluidics gives him key understanding into the future of technologies, including 3D printing, to Stacy Brown-Philpot, former CEO of  TaskRabbit, a company at the forefront of today’s personal services-oriented disruptive technology boom, and a member of the investment  committee of the SB Opportunity Fund, a $100 million venture fund for outstanding Black, Latinx, and Native American company founders, our  Board members are advising us based on real world experiences. Jami Miscik brings significant leadership and experience in international affairs,  intelligence and risk assessment from roles in the private and public sectors, including a distinguished career at the Central Intelligence Agency.  Their skills are complementary. Chip Bergh’s experience at Procter & Gamble and now Levi Strauss means he can instantly grasp the complexities  of our supply chain and Richard Clemmer brings expertise in high-tech industries, including semiconductor, storage, e-commerce and software  companies, from his experience at NXP Semiconductors and Agere Systems. Shumeet Banerji and Mary Anne Citrino, on the other hand, both  come from financial industry careers, lending keen eyes to our financial management, risk oversight and investment strategy. Former public  company CEOs Stephanie Burns and Robert Bennett lend the benefit of their experience at the helms of companies and Aida Alvarez provides a  perspective from the field of government. Together, these Directors and their skills help us to keep reinventing and provide proper oversight of  management’s execution of our strategy. 12 www.hpannualmeeting.com The Board recommends a vote FOR each  Director Nominee.

The NGSR Committee uses a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for Director. The NGSR Committee, in consultation with  the Chairman, regularly assesses the appropriate size of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or  otherwise. If vacancies are anticipated, or otherwise arise, the NGSR Committee considers various potential candidates for Director. Candidates  may come to the attention of the NGSR Committee through current Board members, professional search firms, stockholders or other persons.  As part of the search process for each new director, the NGSR Committee actively seeks out diverse candidates to include in the pool from  which director candidates are chosen. Identified candidates are evaluated at regular or special meetings of the NGSR Committee and may be  considered at any point during the year. As described below, the NGSR Committee considers properly submitted stockholder recommendations  of candidates for the Board to be included in our proxy statement. Following verification of the stockholder status of individuals proposing  candidates, recommendations are considered collectively by the NGSR Committee at a regularly scheduled meeting, which is generally the first or  second meeting prior to the issuance of the proxy statement for our annual meeting. If any materials are provided by a stockholder in connection  with the nomination of a Director candidate, such materials are forwarded to the NGSR Committee. The NGSR Committee also reviews materials  provided by professional search firms and other parties in connection with a nominee who is not proposed by a stockholder. In evaluating  such nominations, the NGSR Committee seeks to achieve a balance of diverse knowledge, experience and capability on the Board. The NGSR  Committee evaluates nominees recommended by stockholders using the same criteria it uses to evaluate all other candidates. In the case of  Ms. Miscik, a third-party professional search firm identified her as a potential director nominee. The Board annually reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Directors in the context of the current composition of the Board,  our operating requirements and the long-term interests of our stockholders. The Board believes that its members should possess a variety of  skills, professional experience, and backgrounds in order to effectively oversee our business. In addition, the Board believes that each Director  should possess certain attributes, as reflected in the Board membership criteria described below. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain the current Board membership criteria that apply to nominees recommended for a position on the  Board. Under those criteria, members of the Board should: — have sufficient time to carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on experience (which means that Directors’  service on other boards of public companies should be limited to a number that permits them, given their individual circumstances, to  responsibly perform all Director duties). In addition, the NGSR Committee takes into account a potential Director’s ability to contribute to the diversity of background (such as race, gender,  age and cultural background) and experience represented on the Board, and it reviews its effectiveness in balancing these considerations when  assessing the composition of the Board. Although the Board uses these and other criteria as appropriate to evaluate potential nominees, it has no  stated minimum criteria for nominees. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines can be found on our website at https://investor.hp.com/governance/ governance-documents/default.aspx. In addition, our Bylaws also require that to be qualified to serve as a Director and to be eligible to be a  Director nominee, each Director and Director nominee: — must not be a named subject of a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses) pending as of the date HP first  mails the proxy materials that include the name of the nominee and, within the ten years preceding such date, must not have been convicted  in such a criminal proceeding. All members of the HP Board are provided with opportunities for in-person and remote Director education on an ongoing basis, covering a variety  of subjects relevant to HP. Recent topics have included strategy, innovation, people and culture development, best practices in governance and  leadership, industry updates and technology trends. The Board believes that all the nominees named above are highly qualified and have the skills and experience required for effective service on the  Board. All the nominees named above have indicated to us that they will be available to serve as Directors. In the event that any nominee should  become unavailable, the proxy holders, Enrique Lores and Harvey Anderson, will vote for a substitute nominee or nominees designated by the  Board, unless the Board decides to decrease the size of the Board. If any substitute nominees are so designated, we will file an amended proxy statement or additional soliciting material that, as applicable, identifies the substitute nominees, discloses that such nominees have consented  to being named in the amended proxy statement or additional soliciting material and to serve as directors if elected, and includes certain  biographical and other information about such nominees required by the applicable SEC rules. There are no family relationships among our executive officers and Directors. On an annual basis at or near the end of each fiscal year, each Director completes a self-evaluation designed to gauge the health of board function  and composition. Topics addressed in the self-evaluation process include individual performance, performance of all committees on which the  Director served during the fiscal year, performance of the Board as a whole, areas for improvement, accessibility of management, time allocation,  and quality of materials. Directors also provide us with input on key focus areas for the Board in the upcoming fiscal year. The NGSR Committee oversees the annual self-evaluation process in conjunction with input from the independent Chairman of the Board and reviews the  findings with the independent Chairman to assess board health. Each committee additionally reviews the consolidated committee self-evaluation results. Stockholder Recommendations The policy of the NGSR Committee is to consider properly submitted stockholder recommendations of candidates for membership on the Board  as described above under the heading “Identifying and Evaluating Candidates for Directors.” In evaluating such recommendations, the NGSR  Committee seeks to achieve a balance of diverse knowledge, experience and capability on the Board and to consider all applicable membership  criteria. Any stockholder recommendations submitted for consideration by the NGSR Committee should include verification of the stockholder  status of the person submitting the recommendation and the recommended candidate’s name and qualifications for Board membership and  should be addressed to our Corporate Secretary at HP Inc., 1501 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304. In addition, our Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate Directors for consideration at an annual stockholder meeting and, under certain  circumstances, to include their nominees in the HP proxy statement. For a description of the process for nominating Directors in accordance with  our Bylaws, see “Questions and Answers—Voting Information.” 22 www.hpannualmeeting.com *  Ms. Matsuoka and Mr. Mobley are not standing for re-election at the annual meeting and will each step down from the Board, effective at the annual meeting.

HP’s corporate governance policies and practices are continuously evolving – from our time as Hewlett-Packard Company to our identity as HP  Inc., we have always led by example, adopting changes in line with our commitment to the highest standards of governance. Stockholder input  has been key to our progression and as we continue to evolve our corporate governance policies and practices, we will continue to solicit feedback  from our stockholders regarding our governance profile. The following examples highlight some of the key features of our corporate governance  policies and practices, including updates we have recently made to strengthen our policies and practices: — Our Bylaws provide our stockholders with a proxy access right.   — All members of our committees are independent. — Our stockholders owning 15% or more of our common stock have a right to call special meetings. We lowered this from 25% after engaging  with our stockholders on what rights to act outside of the annual meeting they would prefer. — Directors are elected annually by majority vote in uncontested Director elections. — We have adopted a policy whereby any incumbent Director who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in uncontested Director elections  will tender his or her offer of resignation. — We maintain a close, effective dialogue with our stockholders through an ongoing stockholder outreach program. — Non-employee Directors are expected to own Company stock equal to at least five times their annual cash Board retainer within five years of  joining the Board. — We have evaluated our governance practices against the Corporate Governance Principles for U.S. Listed Companies published by the  Investor Stewardship Group (“ISG”), a collective of some of the largest U.S.-based institutional investors and global asset managers, and we  believe that our governance policies and practices are consistent with the ISG principles. The following table shows how certain of our key  governance practices align with the ISG principles: The Board determined that Dr. Burns, who serves as Chair of the HRC Committee, and each of the other HRC Committee members (Ms. Alvarez,  Mr. Banerji, Mr. Bergh and Mr. Mobley) are independent within the meaning of the NYSE standards of independence for directors and  compensation committee members. People Processes & Culture   — reviewing employee engagement and cultural initiatives including key training and  development programs (such as executive and manager training, unconscious bias), diversity,  equity and inclusion programs and results of the annual employee engagement survey; and Principle 1: Boards are accountable to  stockholders.   — Annual election of each Director, for a one-year term Principle 2: Stockholders should be entitled to  voting rights in proportion to their  economic interest. Principle 3: Boards should be responsive to  stockholders and be proactive  in order to understand their  perspectives. — monitoring the key health metrics to evaluate the workforce including workforce diversity, pay  equity, key hires, turnover and restructuring. The HP Board continuously evaluates its leadership structure, taking into account the evolving needs of the business and the interests of HP’s  stockholders. Our Board continues to believe that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to separate the Chairman of the  Board and Chief Executive Officer roles and for our Chairman to be independent. Currently, Mr. Bergh serves as our independent Chairman of the  Board. Our Board believes that our current structure, with an independent Chairman who is well-versed in the needs of a complex business and  has strong, well-defined governance duties, gives our Board a strong leadership and corporate governance structure that best serves the needs  of HP and its stockholders. The Board will continue to evaluate its leadership structure on an ongoing basis and may make changes as appropriate  to HP and its future needs. — works with the NGSR Committee to oversee the Board and committee evaluations and recommends changes to improve the Board, the  committees, and individual Director effectiveness; and   — performs such other functions and responsibilities as set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines or as requested by the Board from  time to time. 28 www.hpannualmeeting.com ISG Principle HP Governance Policy or Practice Principle 4: Boards should have a strong,  independent leadership structure.   — Independent Chair of the Board, with clearly defined responsibilities Principle 5: Boards should adopt structures  and practices that enhance their  effectiveness. Principle 6: Boards should develop  management incentive structures  that are aligned with the long-term  strategy of the company. During fiscal 2020, the Directors regularly met in executive session, including executive sessions of only the independent Directors. Throughout  fiscal 2020, Mr. Bergh served as independent Chairman. As such, Mr. Bergh scheduled and chaired each executive session held during fiscal 2020.  Any independent Director may request that an additional executive session be scheduled. Board Committees also have regular executive sessions  without management present. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on our website at https://investor.hp.com/governance/governance-documents/ default.aspx, provide that a substantial majority of the Board will consist of independent Directors and that the Board can include no more  than three Directors who are not independent Directors. The independence standards can be found as Exhibit A to our Corporate Governance  Guidelines. Our Director independence standards are consistent with, and in some respects more stringent than, the NYSE director independence  standards. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee meets the heightened independence standards required for audit committee  members under the applicable listing and SEC standards and each member of the HRC Committee meets the heightened independence standards  required for compensation committee members under the applicable listing standards and SEC standards. — The Director is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of HP, or an immediate family member of the Director is, or has been  within the last three years, an executive officer of HP. — The Director has been employed as an executive officer of HP, its subsidiaries or affiliates within the last five years. — The Director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve-month period within the last three  years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from HP, other than compensation for Board service, compensation received by a  Director’s immediate family member for service as a non-executive employee of HP, and pension or other forms of deferred compensation  for prior service with HP that is not contingent on continued service.   — (A) The Director or an immediate family member is a current partner of the firm that is HP’s internal or external auditor; (B) the Director  is a current employee of such a firm; (C) the Director has an immediate family member who is a current employee of such a firm and who  personally worked on HP’s audit; or (D) the Director or an immediate family member was within the last three years (but is no longer) a  partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on HP’s audit within that time. — The Director or an immediate family member is, or has been in the past three years, employed as an executive officer of another company  where any of HP’s present executive officers at the same time serves or has served on that company’s compensation committee. — The Director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a company that has made payments  to, or received payments from, HP for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of  $1 million, or 2% of such other company’s consolidated gross revenues for such company’s last completed fiscal year. — The Director is affiliated with a charitable organization that receives significant contributions from HP.   — The Director has a personal services contract with HP or an executive officer of HP. For these purposes, an “immediate family” member includes a person’s spouse, parents, stepparents, children, step-children, siblings, mother and  father-in-law, sons and daughters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law, and anyone (other than domestic employees) who shares the Director’s home. In determining independence, the Board reviews whether Directors have any material relationship with HP. An independent Director must not  have any material relationship with HP, either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with HP, nor  any relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a Director. In assessing the  materiality of a Director’s relationship to HP, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including consideration of the issues from  the Director’s standpoint and from the perspective of the persons or organizations with which the Director has an affiliation, and is guided by the  standards set forth above. In making its independence determinations, the Board considered transactions occurring since the beginning of fiscal 2018 between HP and entities  associated with the independent Directors or their immediate family members. In addition to the transactions described below under the heading  “Fiscal 2020 Related-Person Transactions,” if any, the Board’s independence determinations included consideration of the following transactions: — Mr. Bergh has served as President and Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Levi Strauss & Co. since September 2011. HP has entered into  transactions for the purchase and sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of its business during the past three fiscal years with Levi  Strauss & Co. The amount that HP paid in each of the last three fiscal years to Levi Strauss & Co., and the amount received in each fiscal year — Mr. Clemmer served as Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of NXP Semiconductors N.V. from January 2009 to May 2020. HP  has entered into transactions for the purchase and sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of its business during the past three  fiscal years with NXP Semiconductors N.V. The amount that HP paid in each of the last three fiscal years to NXP Semiconductors N.V., and  the amount received in each fiscal year by HP from NXP Semiconductors N.V., did not, in any of the previous three fiscal years, exceed the  greater of $1 million or 2% of either company’s consolidated gross revenues.   — Dr. Suresh has served as President of Nanyang Technological University since January 2018. HP has entered into transactions for the  purchase and sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of its business during the past three fiscal years with Nanyang Technological  University. The amount that HP paid in each of the last three fiscal years to Nanyang Technological University, and the amount received  in each fiscal year by HP from Nanyang Technological University, did not, in any of the previous three fiscal years, exceed the greater of  $1 million or 2% of either entity’s consolidated gross revenues. — Ms. Matsuoka has served as Division CEO at Panasonic since October 2019. HP has entered into transactions for the purchase and sale of  goods and services in the ordinary course of its business during the past three fiscal years with Panasonic. The amount that HP paid in each  of the last three fiscal years to Panasonic, and the amount received in each fiscal year by HP from Panasonic, did not, in any of the previous  three fiscal years, exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of either company’s consolidated gross revenues.   — Each of Mr. Banerji, Mr. Bennett, Ms. Brown-Philpot, Dr. Burns, Ms. Citrino, Ms. Matsuoka, Ms. Miscik and Mr. Mobley, or one of their immediate  family members, is a non-employee director, trustee or advisory board member of another company that did business with HP at some time  during the past three fiscal years. These business relationships were as a supplier or purchaser of goods or services in the ordinary course  of business. As a result of this review, the Board has determined the transactions described above and below under the heading “Fiscal 2020 Related-Person  Transactions,” if any, would not interfere with the Director’s exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a Director.  The Board has also determined that, with the exception of Mr. Lores, (i) each of HP’s remaining Directors, including Ms. Alvarez, Mr. Banerji,  Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bergh, Ms. Brown-Philpot, Dr. Burns, Ms. Citrino, Mr. Clemmer, Ms. Matsuoka, Ms. Miscik, Mr. Mobley and Dr. Suresh, and (ii) each  of the members of the Audit Committee, the HRC Committee and the NGSR Committee, has (or had) no material relationship with HP (either  directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with HP) and is (or was) independent within the meaning  of the NYSE and our Director independence standards. The Board has determined that Mr. Lores is not independent because of his status as  our current President and CEO. The Board also determined that Mr. Weisler, who was not subject to re-election at the 2020 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders, was not independent during the period he served on the Board during fiscal 2020 due to his prior service as our President and CEO  until November 1, 2019 and his subsequent role as Senior Executive Advisor to the Company. During fiscal 2020, the Board held 35 meetings, 26 of which included executive sessions. Each incumbent Director serving during fiscal 2020  attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all Board and applicable committee meetings held during the period that he or she served as a Director.  The increase in the number of meetings of the Board from prior years was primarily due to Xerox Holdings Corporation’s unsolicited offer to  acquire HP and the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2020, we had the following four standing committees, which held the number of meetings  indicated in parentheses during fiscal 2020: Audit Committee (12); FIT Committee (12); HRC Committee (10); and NGSR Committee (7). All the  committee charters are available on our investor relations website at https://investor.hp.com/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx. Directors are encouraged to participate in our annual meeting of stockholders. Twelve of our thirteen then-serving Directors attended our last  annual meeting, held on May 12, 2020. Board Risk Oversight The Board, with the assistance of committees of the Board as discussed below, reviews and oversees our enterprise risk management (“ERM”)  program. This enterprise-wide program is designed to enable effective and efficient identification of, and management’s visibility into, critical  enterprise risks. It also facilitates the incorporation of risk considerations into decision making. The ERM program was established to clearly  define risk management roles and responsibilities, bring together senior management to discuss risk, promote visibility and constructive dialogue  around risk at the senior management and Board levels and facilitate appropriate risk response strategies. Under the ERM program, management  develops a holistic portfolio of our enterprise risks by facilitating business and function risk assessments, performing targeted risk assessments  and incorporating information regarding specific categories of risk gathered from various internal HP organizations. Management then  develops risk response plans for risks categorized as needing management focus and response and monitors other identified risk focus areas.  Management provides regular reports on the risk portfolio and risk response efforts to senior management and to the Audit Committee. 30 www.hpannualmeeting.com by HP from Levi Strauss & Co., did not, in any of the previous three fiscal years, exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of either company’s  consolidated gross revenues. The Board oversees management’s implementation of the ERM program, including reviewing our enterprise risk portfolio and evaluating  management’s approach to addressing identified risks. As part of this process, on a quarterly basis, our Chief Information Security Officer reports  to the Board regarding information security matters. Various Board committees also have responsibilities for oversight of risk management that  supplement the ERM program as follows: HP continually seeks to improve and enhance its governance programs. Below we have included an update on our Board’s involvement in our  Environmental, Sustainability and Governance (“ESG”) efforts. HP is one of the leaders in this space through our Sustainable Impact strategy,  which includes Diversity, Equity & Inclusion, Environmental Sustainability and Social Responsibility. For additional information regarding our  Sustainability program, please refer to “Sustainable Impact” on page 8. The NGSR Committee oversees HP’s ESG policies and programs including relevant sustainability issues such as climate change, circular  economy, and resource scarcity. The Board receives regular updates on our progress toward our sustainability strategy and targets. The NGSR Committee seeks to recruit directors of diverse backgrounds to lead the Board. The HRC Committee provides guidance and direction  regarding our talent recruitment and retention strategies, including management succession planning, with a focus on ensuring our leadership  represents the diversity of our workforce and customers worldwide. The Audit Committee’s oversight of our ERM program includes oversight  of our global human rights program and supply chain responsibility program and policies, which involves working with our suppliers to protect  and empower all workers in our supply chain, not just HP employees. The Board and the NGSR Committee are committed to improving the communities in which we operate. This includes providing input on  broad-based strategies for corporate giving, including financial funding and employee engagement. Risk and  compliance oversight HP’s approximately 53,000 employees worldwide power our innovation, contributing unique perspectives and a growth mindset to create  breakthrough technologies and transformative solutions. We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and  retains exceptional talent with equitable pay. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a  focus on health, safety and employee wellbeing, we strive to support our employees holistically so they can do their best work, every single  day. To ensure leadership has a key focus on Environment, Sustainability and Governance “ESG”, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion “DEI”, Employee  Engagement and Talent, each executive leadership team member has individual performance goals under the Management by Objectives  (“MBOs”) program pertaining to these areas. The unique challenges of 2020 have only underscored the importance of positioning our employees to excel. Since the onset of the COVID-19  pandemic, we have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees manage their work and personal responsibilities, with a strong focus  on employee wellbeing, health and safety. In an effort to keep our employees connected, we focused our efforts in four key areas: Education,  Health and Wellbeing, Family Support and Work Flexibility, and Community. We also assisted our hourly employees and certain contingent  workers with continued pay and other supporting benefits and deferred workforce reduction notifications, in the first phase of our response to  the pandemic. HP is dedicated to growing and developing our workforce globally with a variety of educational programs and experiences. In 2020, we offered  numerous leadership program such as Catalyst, Lead@HP, Building Innovative Leaders (with Stanford), HPLX and ELX, an accelerated leadership  program for our most senior executives with a series of Masterclasses, many taught by our own Directors. — monitoring key workforce health metrics including workforce diversity, key hires, turnover and restructuring. Management regularly updates the Board and the HRC Committee on the status of such initiatives and programs. Innovation at HP comes from the diverse perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of our employees. We strive to create an inclusive  workplace where people can bring their authentic selves to work. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly  skilled and diverse board that provides independent oversight. We are among the top technology companies for women in executive positions.  Women represent 29.6% of HP’s full-time executive positions and 32.3% of full-time director-level employees. We are committed to increasing  representation of women at HP overall, but particularly in leadership and technical roles globally. This focus also extends to underrepresented  minorities in the United States, and HP is committed to doubling the number of our Black and African American executives by 2025. 32 www.hpannualmeeting.com 36.9% of HP’s  worldwide  employees are women of HP’s U.S.  employees are racial and ethnic minorities 28.9% 29.6% 32.3% in 2020, 62.0% of our U.S. hires  were from  underrepresented  groups As part of our employee engagement process, we regularly collect feedback to better understand and improve the employee experience and  identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. In 2020, 96% of employees participated in our annual employee survey. Last  year we achieved our highest level of employee engagement (top quartile). Employees’ highest-rated areas were the following: diversity and  inclusion (95%), and ethics and integrity (95%). HP is committed to embracing a culture that not only denounces racism but is actively anti-racist, and to using HP’s platform, technology, and  resources as a force for positive change. The HP Foundation pledged $500,000 to social justice organizations to confront and combat systemic  racism and inequality in society. HP has also built an internal Racial Equality Taskforce with nearly 500 employees participating. The Task Force is  focused on addressing systemic racism by advancing efforts inside HP, accelerating our external ecosystem and affecting change at the local and  national level. We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To  deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and  experience, the location of their job, and their performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall  workforce and individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. For the past five years and with the support of independent third-party experts in this field, HP has reviewed the compensation of  employees to ensure consistent pay practices by conducting a pay equity analysis annually reviewing employees in comparable roles within a  country/location. HP expanded its annual pay equity assessment in 2020—evaluating the eight countries with our largest employee populations, representing  65% of our global workforce. The independent analysis found no systemic issues, and any outliers were addressed as part of the off-cycle  compensation review process. Enhancing tools and processes to increase  employee productivity and effectiveness. Bolstering learning and development  programs that maximize career growth  opportunities. — Our community of Business Impact Networks (“BINs”) has increased to 122 chapters across 29 countries. Our global constituencies  include Women, MultiCultural, disAbilities, Veterans, MultiGenerational and Pride BINs. Our directors frequently meet directly with  BINs representatives. — In 2019, over 24 schools participated in the HBCU (historically black college or university) Challenge, a business school competition with  the National HBCU Business Deans Roundtable resulting in internships and full-time employment at HP. — Since 2017, hundreds of leaders globally have participated in Catalyst@HP, a women’s sponsorship organization that works to advance  careers of women, and 37% of those have been promoted or are in a new role. During 2020, we continued to evolve our program and  launched an all African American/Black Catalyst @ HP program. — Building on the work we did in 2018 to address unconscious bias, we integrated our training on this topic into our Belong at HP  development and sponsorship program. A 3.5-hour facilitator-led workshop focuses on promoting inclusive mindsets and behaviors  across the organization, including our recruitment processes. While hundreds of employees have taken Belong at HP over the past few  years, we will be making it mandatory for all employees in the future. Driving innovation, agility, and employee  alignment with HP’s strategy and direction. Human capital development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative  products and services. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development  opportunities, including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development. In 2020, 98% of  employees participated in learning and development activities, including these key highlights: — Responded to COVID-19-related restrictions by quickly pivoting to new virtual learning workshops, and providing online development for  all employees through our Brain Candy social learning platform;   — Launched new digital skills development program, with nearly 70% of employees worldwide earning a digital badge to recognize their  digital literacy; and   — Partnered with executive business leaders to amplify HP’s inclusion, diversity, and social justice values in a series of 90-minute  engagement and development townhall sessions. The physical health, financial wellbeing, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to HP’s success. As soon as COVID-19 started to take hold on a global scale, HP took swift action to protect our people in line with public health guidance— pivoting to work from home, prohibiting business travel, restricting site access, and implementing enhanced sanitization processes. We also  offered employees access to virtual office hours with the HP Medical Doctor. For other workplace health and safety risks, our environmental, health, and safety leadership team uses our global injury and illness reporting  system to assess worldwide and regional trends as a part of quarterly reviews. Our manufacturing facilities continue to represent our most  significant health and safety risks, due to higher potential exposure to chemicals and machinery related hazards. Reducing and effectively  managing risks at these facilities remains a focus, and injury rates continue to be low. We also sponsor a global wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial, and mental wellbeing for all our employees around the  world. Throughout the year, we encourage healthy behaviors through regular communications, educational sessions, voluntary progress  tracking, wellness challenges, and other incentives. During fiscal 2020, Frederic W. Cook and Co., Inc. (“FW Cook”), independent compensation consultant to the HRC Committee, conducted an  annual risk assessment of our executive compensation program as well as incentive and commission arrangements below the executive level. In  addition, management separately reviewed the administration and controls for incentive plans below the executive level. Based on these reviews, the HRC concluded that our compensation program does not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material  adverse effect on HP, and that our program reflects a balance in design, policies, management controls, and HRC Committee oversight that is  consistent with market “best-practice” for mitigating potential compensation-related risk. We maintain a code of business conduct and ethics for Directors, officers and employees known as Integrity at HP, which is available on our website  at https://investor.hp.com/governance/integrity-at-hp/default.aspx. If the Board grants any waivers from Integrity at HP to any of our Directors or  executive officers, or if we amend Integrity at HP, we will, if required, disclose these matters via updates to our website on a timely basis. 34 www.hpannualmeeting.com We believe that effective corporate governance should include regular, constructive conversations with our stockholders. Over the past year,  the Board has continued to engage with stockholders, including seeking and encouraging feedback from stockholders about our corporate  governance practices by conducting stockholder outreach and engagement throughout the year. Our annual corporate governance investor  outreach cycle, in which the Chair of the Board, Chair of the HRC Committee and other Directors typically participate, is outlined below. In fiscal 2020, we also conducted outreach regarding our governance profile as part of our annual investor outreach cycle in the early part of  the year. Through this program, we met or spoke with institutional investors representing approximately 30% of our outstanding stock during  fiscal 2020 as well as with proxy advisor firms. In fiscal 2021, prior to the filing of this proxy statement, we conducted our fiscal 2021 outreach  regarding our governance profile. Through this program, we met or spoke with institutional investors representing approximately 30% of  our outstanding stock as of December 31, 2020, as well as proxy advisor firms. This most recent engagement confirmed that many of our  stockholders continue to be satisfied with our corporate governance profile, which includes a stockholder right to call a special meeting at a  15% threshold (lowered from 25% following our previous stockholder outreach), proxy access, annual election of directors, a majority voting  standard in uncontested director elections, and independent board leadership. Please see page 74 detailing our previous stockholder outreach  conducted regarding the 2018 written consent proposal, which can be found in the opposition statement to the stockholder proposal.

The policy provides that the NGSR Committee reviews certain transactions subject to the policy and decides whether to approve or ratify those  transactions. In doing so, the NGSR Committee determines whether the transaction is in the best interests of HP. In making that determination,  the NGSR Committee considers, among other factors it deems appropriate: — the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; and   — the terms of the transaction. The NGSR Committee has delegated authority to the Chair of the NGSR Committee to pre-approve or ratify transactions where the aggregate  amount involved is expected to be less than $1 million. A summary of any new transactions pre-approved by the Chair is provided to the full NGSR Committee for its review at each of the NGSR  Committee’s regularly scheduled meetings. The NGSR Committee has adopted standing pre-approvals under the policy for limited transactions with related persons. Pre-approved  transactions include:   — compensation of executive officers that is excluded from reporting under SEC rules where the HRC Committee approved (or recommended  that the Board approve) such compensation; — transactions where all stockholders receive proportional benefits. A summary of new transactions covered by the standing pre-approvals relating to other companies (as described above) is provided to the NGSR  Committee for its review in connection with that committee’s regularly scheduled meetings. Fiscal 2020 Related-Person Transactions We enter into commercial transactions with many entities for which our executive officers or non-employee Directors serve as non-employee  Directors and/or employees in the ordinary course of our business. All those transactions were pre-approved transactions as defined above. There  have otherwise been no related-person transactions (actual or proposed) since the beginning of HP’s last completed fiscal year. 36 www.hpannualmeeting.com Non-employee Director compensation is determined annually by the independent members of the Board acting on the recommendation of  the HRC Committee. In formulating its recommendation, the HRC Committee considers market data for our peer group and input from the  independent compensation consultant retained by the HRC Committee. Lores, as an employee of the Company, does not receive any separate  compensation for his HP Board service. Similarly, Mr. Weisler did not receive any separate compensation for his HP Board service during fiscal  2020 because he was an employee of the Company during the period he served on the Board. For the 2020 Board year, which began March 1, 2020 (and therefore approximates the period between annual stockholder meetings when  non-employee Directors are regularly elected), each non-employee Director was initially entitled to receive an annual cash Board retainer of  $105,000. Non-employee Directors serving prior to March 1, 2020 could elect to defer up to 50% of their annual cash retainer for the 2020  Board year. Non-employee Directors who joined after February 28, 2020 could elect to defer 100% of their annual cash retainer for the 2020  Board year. For the 2021 Board year, non-employee Directors may elect to defer 100% of their annual cash retainer. Additionally, in lieu of the  annual cash retainer, non-employee Directors may elect to receive an equivalent value of equity in fully vested shares. For fiscal 2020, four  non-employee Directors elected to defer their annual cash retainer. In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board approved a  reduction of 25% of the annual cash retainer paid to non-employee Directors for their service from June 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020. This  reduction also applied to any equity elected by the non-employee Director to be received in lieu of cash. Each non-employee Director also received an annual equity Board retainer of $215,000 for service during the 2020 Board year, with regular  grants on the date of the annual stockholder meeting. Under special circumstances, the annual equity retainer may be paid in cash. No annual  equity retainer was paid in cash during fiscal 2020. Starting with the 2020 Board year, the HRC eliminated individual non-employee Director’s  choice to receive a portion of the equity retainer in stock options to better align with market practice. Equity grants to non-employee Directors are  primarily intended to strengthen alignment with stockholder interests and to reinforce a long-term ownership view of the Company and its value.  Retention is not the focus of equity grants for non-employee Directors, which is why service-related vesting on equity awards was eliminated in  July 2017. Non-employee Directors may elect to defer the settlement of shares received as part of the program until either (a) the first to occur  of the Director’s death, disability (as defined in Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) or when the non- employee Director no longer serves as a member of the HP Board (a “Separation From Service” as defined in Section 409A of the Code) or (b)  April 1 of a given year. The Chairman of the Board receives an additional $200,000 annual cash retainer in recognition of the greater duties that the position requires.  In addition to the regular annual cash and equity retainers, and the Chairman retainer described above, the non-employee Directors who served  as chairs of standing committees during fiscal 2020 received cash retainers for such service. The Board approved annual cash retainers for  committee chairs as follows for fiscal 2020: — $35,000 for the Audit Committee Chair;   — $25,000 for the HRC Committee Chair;   — $20,000 for the NGSR Committee Chair; and   — $20,000 for Chairs of other Board standing committees. Each non-employee Director also receives $2,000 for each Board meeting attended in excess of ten meetings per Board year, and $2,000 for each  committee meeting attended in excess of a total of ten meetings of each committee per Board year. In response to the impact of the COVID-19  pandemic, Board members have waived their fees from additional Board meetings. HP donated these fees totaling $326,000 to the HP Employee  Relief Fund. Non-employee Directors are reimbursed for their expenses in connection with attending Board meetings, including expenses related to spouses  when they are invited to attend Board events, and non-employee Directors may use the Company aircraft for travel to and from Board meetings  and other Company events. (1)  Ms. Miscik was appointed to our Board during our Fiscal 2021 year. Accordingly, she did not receive any compensation during Fiscal 2020. (2)  For purposes of determining Director compensation, the Board year begins in March and ends the following February, which does not coincide with our  November through October fiscal year.

This also includes cash earned in the  period described that was deferred by Director election into the 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which provides that Directors may elect when to  receive their deferred cash annual retainer. See “Additional Information about Fees Earned or Paid in Cash in Fiscal 2020” below.

(4)  Mr. Weisler served as President and CEO of HP until November 1, 2019 and subsequently served as Senior Executive Advisor to the Company until May 2020.  Accordingly, he did not receive compensation for his Board service during Fiscal 2020. (5)  Mr. Lores has been serving as President and CEO of HP from November 1, 2019. Accordingly, he does not receive compensation for his Board service. (a)  The Board year begins in March and ends the following February, which does not coincide with HP’s November through October fiscal year. The dollar amounts  shown include cash annual retainers earned for service during the last four months of the March 2019 through February 2020 Board year and cash annual retainers  earned for service during the first eight months of the March 2020 through February 2021 Board year. This also includes cash earned in the period described that  was deferred by Director election into the 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which provides that Directors may elect when to receive their deferred cash  annual retainer. Directors may not receive their deferred cash annual retainer earlier than January 2023. In the case of a termination of service, Directors can elect to  receive the deferred money in the January following the termination of service if the date occurs prior to the specified distribution year elected. 38 www.hpannualmeeting.com Enrique Lores(5) — — — — Name(1) Aida Alvarez 96,712 215,005 — 311,717 Shumeet Banerji 116,698 215,005 — 331,703 Robert R.

During fiscal 2020, Ernst & Young LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm and provided certain other  audit-related and tax services. See “Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors” and “Principal Accountant Fees and Services” below.  Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to participate in the annual meeting, where they will be available to respond to appropriate  questions and, if they desire, to make a statement. Ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2021 fiscal year requires the  affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of HP common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to be voted at the annual  meeting. If the appointment is not ratified, the Board will consider whether it should select another independent registered public accounting  firm. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as HP’s independent  registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of HP and its investors. The Audit Committee represents and assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for general oversight of the integrity of HP’s financial  statements, HP’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications and  independence, the performance of HP’s internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm, and risk assessment and risk  management. The Audit Committee manages HP’s relationship with its independent registered public accounting firm (which reports directly  to the Audit Committee) and is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with HP’s retention of the independent registered public  accounting firm. The Audit Committee has the authority to obtain advice and assistance from outside legal, accounting or other advisors as the  Audit Committee deems necessary to carry out its duties and receives appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit Committee, from HP for  such advice and assistance. HP’s management is primarily responsible for HP’s internal control and financial reporting process. HP’s independent registered public accounting  firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of HP’s consolidated financial statements and issuing opinions on  the conformity of those audited financial statements with United States generally accepted accounting principles and the effectiveness of HP’s  internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee monitors HP’s financial reporting process and reports to the Board on its findings. 40 www.hpannualmeeting.com Our Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification  of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our  independent registered public accounting firm for the  2021 fiscal year. In this context, the Audit Committee hereby reports as follows: 1. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with HP’s management. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the  applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) and the SEC. The Audit Committee has received from the independent registered public accounting firm the written disclosures and the letter required  by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit  Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence. 4. Based on the review and discussions referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and  the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in HP’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  October 31, 2020, for filing with the SEC. The undersigned members of the Audit Committee have submitted this Report to the Board of Directors. AUDIT COMMITTEE  Mary Anne Citrino, Chair  Robert R. Bennett  Stacy Brown-Philpot  Richard L. Clemmer  Subra Suresh Fees incurred by HP for Ernst & Young LLP The following table shows the fees paid or accrued by HP for audit and other services provided by Ernst & Young LLP for fiscal 2020 and 2019. All  fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP were pre-approved in accordance with the pre-approval policy, as discussed below. (1)  Audit fees represent fees for professional services provided in connection with the audit of our financial statements and review of our quarterly financial  statements and audit services provided in connection with other statutory or regulatory filings. (2)  Audit-related fees for fiscal 2020 consisted primarily of accounting consultations, employee benefit plan audits and other attestation services.

Accordingly, we are asking for stockholder approval of the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed  in this proxy statement in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the narrative discussion following the  compensation tables. Although this vote is non-binding, our Board and the HRC Committee value the views of our stockholders and will thoroughly review the voting  results. If there are significant negative votes, we will take steps to understand those concerns that influenced the vote and consider them in  making future decisions about executive compensation. We currently conduct annual advisory votes on executive compensation and expect to  conduct the next advisory vote at our next annual meeting of stockholders in 2022. Vote Required The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of HP common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to be voted on the  proposal at the annual meeting is required for advisory approval of this proposal. 42 www.hpannualmeeting.com Our Board recommends a vote FOR the approval  of the compensation of our NEOs, including  the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the  compensation tables and narrative discussion  following such compensation tables, and the other  related disclosures in this proxy statement. — The majority of target total direct compensation for executives is  performance-based as well as equity-based to align executives’  rewards with sustained stockholder value creation. — Total direct compensation is targeted at or near the median of  our peer group to ensure that it is appropriate and competitive. — Actual realized total direct compensation and pay positioning  are designed to fluctuate with, and be commensurate with,  actual annual and long-term performance, recognizing  company-wide, business unit, and individual results. — Incentive awards are heavily dependent upon our stock  performance and are measured against objective financial metrics  that we believe link either directly or indirectly to the creation of  value for our stockholders. In addition, 25% of our target annual  incentives are contingent upon the achievement of qualitative  objectives that we believe will contribute to our long-term success  including Environment, Sustainability and Governance “ESG”,  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion “DEI”, Employee Engagement,  and Talent. — We balance cash flow, revenue and profit objectives, as well  as short- and long-term objectives to reward for overall  performance that does not over-emphasize a singular focus on a  particular metric or time period. Also, we have payout governors  on key financial metric outcomes designed to avoid significantly  overachieving on one metric, without taking into consideration  our performance on other plan metrics (as explained in more  detail starting on page 49). — A significant portion of our long-term incentives are delivered in  the form of performance-adjusted restricted stock units, referred  to as “PARSUs”, which vest upon the achievement of earnings  per share (“EPS”) objectives which can be modified by relative  total shareholder return (“TSR”). — For fiscal 2020, the payouts under annual incentive awards  and under PARSUs are capped at 200% of bonus target and  2x target shares, respectively.   — We validate the pay-for-performance relationship on an annual basis  and our Human Resources and Compensation (“HRC”) Committee  reviews and approves performance goals under our incentive plans.   — The compensation of objectively identified peer companies based on  industry and size criteria is considered to confirm that pay levels and  program design for the NEOs are appropriate and competitive. — We conduct a robust stockholder outreach program  throughout the year and use that input to inform our program  decisions and pay practices. — We disclose our corporate performance goals and  achievements relative to these goals.   — We do not utilize fixed term executive employment contracts  for senior officers.   — We devote significant time to management succession  planning and leadership development efforts. — We maintain a consistent market-aligned severance policy for  executives and a conservative change in control policy which  requires a double trigger for execution. — The HRC Committee engages an independent  compensation consultant. — We have clawback and equity-forfeiture provisions that  provide the Board with discretion to recoup compensation in  the event of a material financial restatement or misconduct  that results in material reputational harm to the Company,  which mitigates compensation-related risk. — We maintain strong stock ownership guidelines for executive  officers and non-employee Directors. — We prohibit all employees, including our executive officers,  and also non-employee Directors, from engaging in any form  of hedging transaction involving HP securities, holding HP  securities in margin accounts and pledging stock as collateral  for loans in a manner that could create compensation-related  risk for the Company. — We do not provide excessive perquisites to our employees,  including our executive officers.   — We do not allow our executives to participate in the  determination of their own compensation. — We do not provide tax gross ups in connection with  terminations, including terminations in the event of a change  in control. Components of Compensation Our executive compensation program primarily comprises performance-based components. The table below shows each major pay component,  the role and factors for determining the amount. Percentages are the averages of pay components at target for the NEOs, including the CEO. *  Breakdown does not include compensation paid or payable with respect to fiscal year 2020 to Marie Myers, who was hired on March 1, 2020 and whose service  as acting Chief Financial Officer commenced on October 1, 2020. 44 www.hpannualmeeting.com 10% (i.e., Pay-for-Results (“PfR”)) Payments to executives for annual PfR  incentive purposes are made under the  Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) — Actual awards based on achievement against  annual corporate and business unit financial  metrics and individual goals as set and  approved by the HRC Committee. Financial  metrics are revenue, net earnings and free  cash flow as a percent of revenue — To ensure leadership has a key focus on  ESG, DEI, Employee Engagement and Talent  each executive leadership team member has  MBOs pertaining to these areas. GAAP Net Revenue Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Earnings Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow $ 56.6  BILLION (as defined on page 50) compared to a  target goal of $59.4 billion under our  annual incentive plan. Introduction Financial Highlights As illustrated below for the three key financial measures used to fund our annual pay-for-performance incentive awards, we exceeded one of our  three goals reflected in our business plan in fiscal 2020, even as the global-macroeconomic and foreign-currency environment was challenging. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our executive compensation philosophy and program, the compensation decisions the HRC  Committee has made under the program, and the considerations in making those decisions in fiscal 2020. Enrique J. Lores,  President and CEO *  Ms. Myers was appointed as Chief Financial Officer on February 17, 2021.  Prior to such time, she served as Acting Chief Financial Officer since October 1, 2020. ** Mr. Fieler stepped down as our Chief Financial Officer and left the Company on October 2, 2020. *** Ms. Rivera stepped down as President, Strategy and Business Management and Chief Legal Officer, effective February 1, 2021. Since stepping down from such  positions, Ms. Rivera has continued to be employed by the Company as Special Advisor to the CEO, a non-executive officer role. Executive Summary The HRC Committee continues to review and refine our compensation programs to support our evolving business strategy and attract high caliber  executive talent. The HRC Committee’s assessment includes regular stockholder engagement and consideration of stockholder feedback. Below are brief highlights of key compensation decisions with respect to NEOs: We successfully executed on the Board’s succession-planning process by transitioning to a new HP President & CEO at the start of fiscal 2020. After a robust, in-depth succession planning assessment, Mr. Lores was appointed as President and CEO, effective November 1, 2019. In  connection with his appointment as President and CEO, Mr. Lores’ initial target Total Direct Compensation (“TDC”) was set moderately below the  peer group median. Over the period of the next two or three years, the HRC Committee intends to continually evaluate company and individual  performance while progressively shifting Mr. Lores’ TDC to the median or above median level, as appropriate. During fiscal 2020, the HRC and Board continued their role overseeing succession planning and leadership development. The HRC discussed  talent at every meeting and the Board had frequent top talent review sessions. Directors also had frequent informal interactions with talent  across the company. $ 3.6  BILLION (as defined on page 50) compared to a  target goal of $3.7 billion under our annual  incentive plan. Steven J. Fieler,   Former Chief   Financial Officer** Christoph Schell,   Chief Commercial  Officer 6.9  PERCENT (as a percentage of revenue; as defined  on page 50) compared to a target goal of  5.9% under our annual incentive plan. Kim M. Rivera,  Former President,  Strategy and Business  Management and  Chief Legal Officer*** 46 www.hpannualmeeting.com We regularly engaged with and listened to stockholders, practiced strong governance, and mitigated potential compensation-related risks. Our executive compensation program is continuously reviewed for peer group alignment and strategic relevance as part of a process that includes  ongoing stockholder engagement. At the annual meeting in 2020, our say-on-pay proposal was approved by over 85% of the voted shares,  indicating significant stockholder support. Consequently, we did not make extensive program design changes as a result of the vote. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic our executives took significant reductions in their base salaries. In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Lores and members of the Executive Leadership team, including the NEOs, agreed to  reductions in their base salaries for the period from July 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020. The Board approved a reduction of 25% in the salary  of Mr. Lores, and the HRC approved a 15% reduction in the base salaries of the members of the Executive Leadership team, including NEOs, for  this period of service. Updates Affecting Fiscal 2020 PARSUs. For PARSUs granted during fiscal 2020, we transitioned from a two-year vesting schedule to a three-year vesting schedule to ensure alignment  with our stockholders’ interest and market practices. In addition, EPS became the primary driver of award payout and relative TSR will function as  a market-based “modifier” to adjust payout for alignment with shareholder results. We provided competitive target pay opportunities, where amounts and mix were consistent with peers and stable year over year. Target TDC consists of base salary, percent-of-salary target annual incentives that would be earned for achieving 100% of goals, and regular  long-term incentive grant-date value. TDC is targeted at or near the median of peers to ensure that it is appropriate and competitive but varies  based on experience, individual performance, advancement potential and internal equitability. We align real pay delivery with performance through rigorous goal setting and performance measurement. While our target TDC opportunities reflect market practice, our real pay delivery reflects actual performance. Annual incentives reward short- term performance measured against applicable enterprise-wide, business unit, and individual goals. Goals were set for the overall Company and  businesses against internal budgets for GAAP net revenues, adjusted non-GAAP net earnings, and non-GAAP free cash flow as a percent of revenue.  For fiscal 2020 the HRC set short-term and long-term incentive plan goals at the beginning of the year. Plan goals were not modified during the  performance year. Non-financial individual performance goals under the MBO provisions were set for each NEO. Meanwhile, regular annual long-term incentive grant value was approximately 60% in PARSUs that reward strategic performance measured by  EPS as the primary driver and modified based on relative TSR. Such PARSUs will vest after three years. The remaining portion of 40% of regular  annual long-term incentive grant value was in the form of RSUs. Such RSUs are primarily intended to increase stock ownership among our NEOs,  while also serving a retentive purpose and incentivizing our NEOs to increase our stock price. The value of such RSUs is tied to stock price and  reinvested dividend equivalents. For fiscal 2020, the performance metrics and performance goals used to determine earned short-term incentive and PARSUs remained unchanged. NEOs earned annual incentives averaging 133.9% of target for fiscal 2020. Individual bonuses varied from 118.4% to 143.7% of target with  HP’s President & CEO individual bonus equal to 135.9% of target. The Company achieved below-target results with respect to HP adjusted non- GAAP net earnings and GAAP net revenue. Non-GAAP free cash flow as a percentage of revenue result was significantly above-target at 163%,  but was capped at 150% of target since the HP adjusted non-GAAP net earnings was below target. Further, NEOs successfully delivered against  their MBOs as detailed on pages 51-52. NEOs received payout for Segment 2 FY18 and Segment 1 FY19 PARSUs (measurement periods ending in fiscal 2020). EPS FY19 and EPS FY20  were above target. Fiscal 2018-2020 relative TSR approximated the 33rd percentile of the S&P 500. Fiscal 2019-2020 relative TSR approximated  the 23rd percentile of the S&P 500. The HRC Committee continued to retain FW Cook as its independent consultant during fiscal 2020, and to work with them and management on  all aspects of our pay program for senior executives. The HRC Committee makes recommendations regarding the CEO’s compensation to the  independent members of the Board for approval, and reviews and approves the compensation of the remaining Section 16 officers, including our  NEOs. Each HRC Committee member is an independent non-employee Director with significant expertise in executive compensation matters. FW Cook provides analyses and recommendations that inform the HRC Committee’s decisions; identifies peer group companies for competitive  market comparisons; evaluates market pay data and competitive-position benchmarking; provides analyses and inputs on program structure,  performance measures, and goals; provides updates on market trends and the regulatory environment as it relates to executive compensation;  reviews various management proposals presented to the HRC Committee related to executive and Director compensation; and works with the  HRC Committee to validate and strengthen the pay-for-performance relationship and alignment with stockholder interests. FW Cook does not  perform other services for HP and will not do so without the prior consent of the HRC Committee chair. FW Cook meets with the HRC Committee  chair and the HRC Committee outside the presence of management while in executive session. The HRC Committee met ten times in fiscal 2020, and all ten of these meetings included an executive session. FW Cook participated in nine of the  meetings and, when requested by the HRC Committee chair, in the preparatory meetings and the executive sessions. The CEO recommends compensation for Section 16 officers, including NEOs other than himself, for approval by the HRC Committee. The Board  considered market competitiveness, business results, experience, and individual performance when evaluating fiscal 2020 NEO compensation  and the overall compensation structure. The Chief Human Resources Officer and other members of our executive compensation team, together  with members of our finance and legal organizations, work with the CEO to design and develop the compensation program, to recommend  changes to existing program provisions applicable to NEOs and other senior executives, as well as financial and other targets to be achieved  under those programs, prepare analyses of financial data, peer comparisons and other briefing materials to assist the HRC Committee in making  its decisions, and implement the decisions of the HRC Committee. During fiscal 2020, management continued to engage Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (“Meridian”) as its compensation consultant. The HRC  Committee took into consideration that Meridian provided executive compensation-related services to management when it evaluated any information  and analyses provided by Meridian, all of which were also independently reviewed by FW Cook, as applicable, on the HRC Committee’s behalf. During fiscal 2020, Mr. Lores provided input to the HRC Committee regarding performance metrics and the setting of appropriate performance  targets for his direct reports. Lores also recommended MBOs for the NEOs (other than himself) and the other senior executives who report  directly to him. Lores is subject to the same financial performance goals as the executives who lead global functions, and Mr. Lores’ MBOs and  compensation are established by the HRC Committee and recommended to the independent members of the Board for approval. The HRC Committee reviews the compensation of our Section 16 officers in comparison to that of executives in similar positions at our peer  group companies. Our peer group includes companies we compete with for executive talent due to our geographical proximity and technology  industry overlap. The HRC Committee takes size differentiations into consideration when reviewing the results of market data analysis. The HRC  Committee uses this information to evaluate how our pay levels and practices compare to market practices. — Direct talent market peers. — US-based companies in the technology sector (excluding distributors, contract manufacturers and outsourced services/IT consulting) with  revenues between ~$11 billion and $290 billion and market cap between ~$6 billion and $150 billion. — Select general industry companies (industrials, consumer products and telecom) generally meeting size and business criteria that are top-brands.   — Review of the peer companies chosen by companies within our proposed peer group and peer business similarity, to evaluate relevance. We believe the resulting peer group provides HP and the HRC Committee with a valid comparison and benchmark for the Company’s executive  compensation program and governance practices. For fiscal 2020, the HRC Committee added Dell Technologies Inc. following its re-listing in  December 2018. The HP peer group for fiscal 2020, as approved by HRC Committee, consisted of the following companies: *  Represents fiscal 2020 reported revenue, except fiscal 2019 reported revenue is provided for Dell, General Electric, Honeywell, IBM, Intel, PepsiCo, Texas  Instruments and Xerox. Process for Setting and Awarding Executive Compensation The primary factors considered when determining pay opportunities for our NEOs are market competitiveness, experience, individual  performance, advancement potential and internal equitability. The weight given to each factor is not formulaic and may differ from year to year or  by individual NEO. The HRC Committee spends significant time determining the appropriate goals for our annual and long-term incentive plans, which make up  the majority of NEO compensation. Management makes an initial recommendation of the goals, which is then assessed by the HRC Committee’s  independent compensation consultant and discussed and approved by the HRC Committee. Major factors considered in setting financial goals for  each fiscal year are business results from the most recently completed fiscal year, budgets and strategic plans, macroeconomic factors, guidance  and analyst expectations, industry performance, conditions or goals specific to a particular business segment, and strategic initiatives. MBOs are  set based on major shared and individual strategic, operating, ESG, DEI, Employee Engagement, Talent and tactical initiatives. Following the close of the fiscal year, the HRC Committee reviews actual financial results and MBO performance against the goals that it had  set for the applicable plans for that year, with payouts under the plans determined based on performance against the established goals. The  HRC Committee meets in executive session to review the MBO performance of the CEO and to determine a recommendation for his annual PfR  incentive award to be approved by the independent members of the Board. See “2020 Annual Incentives” below for a further description of our  results and corresponding incentive payouts. 48 www.hpannualmeeting.com Company Apple Inc.

The HRC Committee regularly considers ways to improve our executive compensation program by considering stockholder feedback, our current  business needs and strategy, and peer group practices. Our executives receive a small percentage of their overall compensation in the form of base salary, which is consistent with our philosophy of  tying the majority of pay to performance. The NEOs are paid an amount in the form of base salary sufficient to attract qualified executive talent  and maintain a stable management team. The HRC Committee aims to set executive base salaries at or near the market median for comparable positions. In fiscal 2020, salaries generally  comprise on average 10% of our NEOs’ overall compensation, consistent with our peers. To decide the CEO’s salary, the HRC Committee reviews  analyses and recommendations provided by FW Cook. For fiscal 2020, the HRC Committee approved changes to the base salary rates of our NEOs, other than Ms. Myers who was hired on March 1, 2020 and  transitioned into the role of Acting Chief Financial Officer on October 1, 2020 and was subsequently appointed Chief Financial Officer on February 17,  2021. In the case of Mr. Lores, his base salary adjustment for fiscal 2020 reflects his promotion to President and CEO on November 1, 2019. (*) Ms. Myers was hired on March 1, 2020 and transitioned into the role of Acting Chief Financial Officer on October 1, 2020. Myers was subsequently appointed  as Chief Financial Officer on February 17, 2021. The fiscal 2020 annual PfR incentive plan consisted of the following three core financial metrics: GAAP net revenue, adjusted non-GAAP net  earnings, and non-GAAP free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. A fourth metric, MBOs, was used to further drive individual performance and  achievement of key strategic goals. Each metric was weighted at 25% of the target award value. Each individual metric may fund up to 250% of  target; however, the maximum annual PfR incentive for each executive is capped at 200% of target. The target annual PfR incentive awards for fiscal 2020 were set at 200% of salary for the CEO and 125% of salary for the other NEOs. In addition,  payment under the annual PfR incentive plan is contingent on an NEO’s service through the end of the fiscal year. Fieler left the Company on  October 2, 2020, and was not eligible to receive the annual PfR. Enrique Lores $750,000 $1,200,000 +60.0% Kim Rivera $725,000 $ 730,000 +0.7% Alex Cho $675,000 $ 740,000 +9.6% Steven Fieler $690,000 $ 760,000 +10.1% Christoph Schell $740,000 $ 760,000 +2.7% Listening to our Stockholders on Compensation We regularly engage with our stockholders on a variety of issues, including their views on best practices in executive compensation. The  following changes to our executive compensation program, shown here, reflect those conversations with stockholders. — Starting with new grants in fiscal 2020, to ensure alignment with our three-year financial plan, we have moved our long-term  performance-based incentives (PARSUs) to incorporate a three-year average EPS performance with full vesting only after three  years of service and achievement of financial goals for that timeframe. We changed relative TSR from a standalone measure to a  “payout modifier” determined based on cumulative three-year performance. We feel that this will increase focus on line-of-sight  strategic performance while continuing close alignment between stockholder value creation and real pay delivery. — Additional changes made in the recent past that reflect conversations with stockholders include increased focus on enterprise-wide  GAAP net revenue and adjusted non-GAAP net earnings in our annual PfR incentive plan to encourage greater collaboration and  teamwork among business leaders. The specific metrics, their linkage to corporate results, and the weighting that was placed on each were chosen because the HRC Committee  believed that:   — Performance against these metrics, in combination, enhances value for stockholders, capturing both the top and bottom line, as well as cash  and capital efficiency. — A balanced weighting of metrics limits the likelihood of rewarding executives for excessive risk-taking.   — Different measures avoid paying for the same performance twice. — MBOs enhance focus on business objectives, such as operational objectives, strategic initiatives, ESG, DEI, and Employee Engagement and  Talent goals, succession planning, and people development, which are important to the long-term success of the Company. The following chart sets forth the definition of and rationale for each of the financial performance metrics that was used for the Fiscal 2020  Annual Incentive Plan: 50 www.hpannualmeeting.com (1)  Maximum funding for non-GAAP free cash flow as a percentage of revenue is capped at 150% of target if adjusted non-GAAP net earnings achievement  was below target and is capped at 100% of target if adjusted non-GAAP net earnings achievement was below threshold. If adjusted non-GAAP net earnings  achievement was above target, the maximum funding level is 250% for this metric. Maximum and threshold information are not disclosed because such  disclosure would result in competitive harm. However, goals are set at levels we believe to be achievable in connection with strong performance. (2)  Interpolated for performance between discrete points. Each individual metric may fund up to 250% of target; however, the maximum annual PfR incentive for  each executive is capped at 200% of target. As a general administrative discretionary guideline, the HRC Committee may decide that financial funding for Global  Functions Executives, including the CEO, cannot exceed the highest funding for a Business Unit Executive. (3)  The Global Functions Executives include Mr. Lores, Ms. Myers, Mr. Fieler, Mr. Schell and Ms. Rivera. (4)  The Business Unit Executives include Mr. Specific Business Unit GAAP net revenue and adjusted non-GAAP net earnings goals are not disclosed because  such disclosure would result in competitive harm. However, goals are set at levels we believe to be achievable in connection with strong performance. % Payout  Metric(2)  (%) Weight 25% 25% 25% 25% Linkage Global Functions Executives(3) Corporate Corporate Corporate Individual Business Unit (“BU”) Executives(4) Corporate/BU Corporate/BU Corporate Individual Corporate Performance Goals Maximum — — — Various 250 Target $59.4 $3.7 5.9% Various 100 Threshold — — — Various 0 Financial Performance  Metrics Definition Rationale for Metric GAAP Net   Revenue Net revenue as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for  fiscal 2020 Reflects top line financial performance, which  is a strong indicator of our long-term ability to  drive stockholder value GAAP Business   Revenue Segment net revenue as reported in our Annual Report on Form  10-K for fiscal 2020 Adjusted Non-GAAP  net earnings(1) Non-GAAP net earnings, as defined and reported in our fourth  quarter fiscal 2020 earnings press release (of $3.2 billion in fiscal  2020) and summarized in footnote (1) below, further adjusted by  excluding bonus net of income tax (1)  As summarized above, adjusted non-GAAP net earnings is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as GAAP net earnings (of $2.8 billion in fiscal 2020), which  excludes (i) after-tax costs of $390 million related to restructuring and other charges, acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets,  non-operating retirement-related credits/(charges), debt extinguishment costs, defined benefit plan settlement charges and tax adjustments as well as  (ii) bonus net of income tax. Management uses adjusted non-GAAP net earnings to evaluate and forecast our performance before gains, losses, or other  charges that are considered by management to be outside of our core business segment operating results. We believe that presenting adjusted non-GAAP net  earnings provides investors with greater visibility with respect to the information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. We  further believe that providing this additional non-GAAP information helps investors understand our operating performance and evaluate the efficacy of the  methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. This additional non-GAAP information is not intended to be  considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP diluted net earnings. (2)  As summarized above, non-GAAP free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure that is defined as net cash provided by operating activities ($4.3 billion in fiscal 2020)  adjusted for net investments in leases ($152 million in fiscal 2020) and net investments in property, plant and equipment ($577 million in fiscal 2020). HP’s  management uses non-GAAP free cash flow for the purpose of determining the amount of cash available for investment in HP’s businesses, repurchasing stock  and other purposes. HP’s management also uses non-GAAP free cash flow to evaluate HP’s historical and prospective liquidity. Lores. Lores’ fiscal 2020 MBOs included but were not limited to: setting strategic direction for the Company to optimize sustainable  stockholder value through strong cost management and growth; balancing investment choices across operating expenses, capital investments,  dividends, share repurchases and M&A; optimizing the Company’s balance sheet to create stockholder value; actively engaging with HP  stockholders to discuss and analyze value creation, promote stockholder value in any extraordinary enterprise transactions, and ensure HP has a  robust evaluation and talent program; and driving employee commitment and engagement while strengthening the HP culture and continuing to  drive diversity throughout the organization. Lores had strong accomplishments, including the following: (1)  Mr. Lores, Ms. Myers, Mr. Schell and Ms. Rivera received annual PfR incentive payments based on corporate financial metrics. Fieler left the Company  on October 2, 2020 and was not eligible to receive the annual PfR. Cho received an annual PfR incentive payment based on corporate and business  financial metrics. (2)  As a general administrative discretionary guideline, the HRC Committee may decide that financial funding for Global Functions Executives, including the CEO,  cannot exceed the highest funding for a Business Unit Executive. Governors also include that HP Adjusted Non-GAAP Net Earnings Before Bonus will need to  be achieved at minimum to be eligible for any award related to the HP GAAP revenue component. Also, Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (% of revenue) is capped at  150% of target if HP Adjusted non- GAAP net earnings achievement is below target. Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (% of revenue) is capped at 100% of target if HP  Adjusted non- GAAP net earnings is below minimum. (3)  The financial metrics were equally weighted to account for 75% of the target annual PfR incentive. (4)  Based on plan governors, Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow (% of revenue) was capped at 150% of target since non-GAAP net earnings achievement was below target.

The HRC Committee determined that Ms. Myers’ MBO performance was achieved above target. In 2020, Ms. Myers did a remarkable job  leading the transformation efforts across the company and the IT organization which were critical to operating effectively with all the pandemic  challenges. Myers also did an excellent job as acting CFO, demonstrating strategic leadership running the Finance organization. Myers is a  highly valuable member of the Executive Leadership Team and an exemplary leader to our HP community. Schell. The HRC Committee determined that Mr. Schell’s MBO performance was achieved above target. Schell successfully implemented a  new Commercial organization in 2020 and navigated unprecedented challenges with the global pandemic all while delivering very strong financial  results. Schell managed supply chain disruptions and a difficult manufacturing environment, partnering effectively with business group  leaders to deliver consistently to partners and clients. Schell also did an excellent job leading the business continuity plan (BCP) around the  pandemic, stabilizing the organization and making critical business decisions that allowed us to keep delivering on our financial commitments.  Mr. Schell is an outstanding global business leader and his skill and experience enhance our leadership. Rivera. The HRC Committee determined that Ms. Rivera’s MBO performance was achieved above target. Rivera effectively managed the  company’s response to Xerox’s takeover proposal. She partnered in leading the BCP team making critical business decisions around health and  on-site safety for employees and customer support. Rivera is a well-respected leader with a strong understanding of commercial decisions  and a strong partner in business, technology and governance matters. The HRC Committee determined that Mr. Cho’s MBO performance was achieved above target. Cho did a remarkable job managing  a complex environment and partnering with business and function group leaders to ensure development of innovative solutions that satisfied  customers’ needs.

The HRC Committee established a total long-term incentive target value for each NEO in early fiscal 2020 that was 60% weighted in the form of  PARSUs and 40% weighted in the form of time-based RSUs. The high proportion of performance-based awards reflects our pay-for-performance  philosophy. The time-based awards support retention and are linked to stockholder value and ownership, which are important goals of our  executive compensation program. The fiscal 2020 PARSUs cliff-vest following the end of a three-year performance period in 2022. The metrics for such PARSUs consist of EPS with  a TSR “payout modifier”. The EPS consists of three annual goals that roll up into our three-year annual average EPS. A TSR “payout modifier” will  then be applied to the EPS average payout to ensure alignment with our stockholders’ experience. TSR will be measured over the full three-year  period based on performance against the S&P 500. The relative TSR is a market-based payout modifier that adjusts payout (-25%, 0% or +25%)  so there is alignment with stockholder results. Final payout is subject to overall 200% of target shares maximum. This structure is depicted in the  chart below: 2020 RSUs and related dividend equivalent units vest ratably on an annual basis over three years from the grant date. Three-year vesting is  common in our industry and supports executive retention and alignment with stockholder value. The following table shows combined total grant values for grants attributable to fiscal 2020. It is important to note that these values are target  opportunities to earn future value-based compensation and are not actual earned amounts, which will be determined after three years based  on continued employment and performance against the EPS as adjusted based on the application of the TSR payout modifier. Myers was  hired on March 1, 2020, and subsequently appointed as Acting Chief Financial Officer on October 1, 2020 and then Chief Financial Officer on  February 17, 2021 and did not receive a grant of PARSUs. Instead, she received a new-hire grant of $1,750,000 in RSUs during fiscal 2020.

In the Summary Compensation Table,  consistent with accounting standards, amounts reflect the grant date fair value for the EPS component for Year 1 (2020), for which goals were  approved in January 2020, and the grant date fair value for the TSR modifier. Grant date fair values for the EPS component for Year 2 (2021) and  Year 3 (2022) are not included in the Summary Compensation Table since EPS goals for those years are approved in their respective fiscal year. The Summary Compensation Table for fiscal 2020 also includes a portion of the fiscal 2019 PARSUs Year 2 EPS (2020) and 2018 PARSUs  Year 3 EPS (2020) for which goals were approved in January 2020. For more information on grants to the NEOs during fiscal 2020, see “Executive Compensation—Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2020.” The fiscal 2019 PARSUs have a two-and three-year vesting period, subject to one-, two-, and three-year performance periods that began at the  start of fiscal 2019 and continue through the end of fiscal 2019, 2020 and 2021. Under this program, 50% of the PARSUs (including dividend  equivalent units) are eligible for vesting based on EPS and 50% are eligible for vesting based on relative TSR performance against the S&P 500.  These PARSUs vest as follows: 16.6% of the units are eligible for vesting based on EPS performance of year one with continued service over two  years, 16.6% of the units are eligible for vesting based on EPS performance of year two with continued service over three years, 16.6% of the  units are eligible for vesting based on EPS performance of year three with continued service over three years, 25% of the units are eligible for  vesting based on relative TSR performance over two years with continued service over two years, and 25% of the units are eligible for vesting  based on relative TSR performance over three years with continued service over three years. This structure is depicted in the chart below: EPS and relative TSR are weighted equally in determining earned PARSUs. The first segment (42% of total target units) vested at the end of fiscal  2020, subject to Year 1 EPS performance and relative TSR performance for the first two years. The second segment (58% of total target units) will  vest after the end of fiscal 2021, subject to Year 2 EPS performance, Year 3 EPS performance, and relative TSR performance for the three years. The actual performance achievement for the one- and two-year periods (i.e., fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2019–2020) as a percentage of target for the  PARSUs as of October 31, 2020 is summarized in the table below: (1)  EPS for PARSU measurement is calculated using non-GAAP Net Earnings adjusted to include bonus at target.

The actual performance achievement for the three-year period (i.e., fiscal 2018–2020) as a percentage of target for the HP PARSUs  as of October 31, 2020 is summarized in the table below: The HRC Committee regularly identifies and evaluates ways to improve our executive compensation program. We believe that our current  compensation structure effectively aligns real pay delivery with critical financial and strategic non-financial goals, reinforces year-over-year  improvement and growth, offers a stable and consistent message to both stockholders and participants, and provides an attractive pay-for- performance incentive opportunity to encourage retention and leadership engagement. — Under the annual incentive plan for fiscal 2021, the metric of “Net Earnings” has been replaced by “Operating Profit”. Also, business unit  revenue and operating profit weighting have each been reduced to 7.5% for a total of 15% (compared to 25% under the annual incentive  plan for fiscal 2020) thereby increasing each HPCO metric to 17.5% for a total of 35% (compared to 25% under the annual incentive plan for  fiscal 2020). — With respect to long-term incentive compensation, the portion of 60% consisting of PARSUs has been split into 30% Performance-Contingent  Stock Options “PCSOs” and 30% PARSUs. The PARSU relative TSR payout modifier has also been adjusted upwards from +/-25% to +/-50%. In connection with her appointment as Chief Financial Officer, effective February 17, 2021, Ms. Myers will receive an annual base salary of $700,000,  a target annual cash bonus under the Company’s pay-for-performance program of 135% of her annual base salary, and other customary benefits,  including annual equity grants, that are generally available to the Company’s other senior executives.  Ms. Myers was also awarded a one-time  equity award with a February 17, 2021 grant date fair value of $1,000,000, consisting of restricted stock units that will vest ratably over three  years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date.  If Ms. Myers is terminated by the Company without cause, she will be eligible to receive  severance benefits provided under the Amended and Restated Severance and Long-term Incentive Change in Control Plan for Executive Officers. We do not provide our executives, including the NEOs, with special or supplemental U.S. defined benefit pension or health benefits. Our NEOs  receive health and welfare benefits (including retiree medical benefits, if eligibility conditions are met) under the same programs and subject to  the same eligibility requirements that apply to our employees generally. Benefits under all U.S. pension plans were frozen effective December 31, 2007. Benefits under the Electronic Data Systems (“EDS”) Pension Plan  ceased upon HP’s acquisition of EDS in 2008. As a result, no NEO or any other HP employee accrued a benefit under any HP U.S. defined benefit  pension plan during fiscal 2020. The amounts reported as an increase in pension benefits in the Summary Compensation Table are for those  NEOs who previously accrued a benefit in a defined benefit pension plan prior to the cessation of accruals and reflect changes in actuarial values  only, not additional benefit accruals. The NEOs, along with other executives who earn base pay or an annual incentive in excess of certain limits of the Code or greater than $160,000,  are eligible to participate in the 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the “EDCP”). This plan is maintained to permit executives to defer  some of their compensation in order to also defer taxation on such amounts. This is a standard benefit plan also offered by most of our peer group  companies. The EDCP permits deferral of base pay in excess of the amount allowed under the qualified HP 401(k) Plan (the “HP 401(k) Plan”) (the  401(k)-deferral limit for calendar 2020 was $19,500) and up to 95% of the annual incentive payable under the Stock Incentive Plan, the PfR Plan (1)  EPS for PARSU measurement is calculated using non-GAAP Net Earnings adjusted to include bonus at target. (2)  Through October 2020, HP’s relative TSR performance was at the 33rd percentile of the S&P 500 which corresponds to a payout of 65.6% of target. Segment 2019 Payout 2020 Payout Fiscal 2018-2020 Results Payout Segment 2 (58%) $2.23 122.7% $2.33 104.2% 33rd percentile 65.6% Target: $2.18 Target: $2.32 EPS(1) vs. Internal Goals Relative TSR vs. S&P 500(2) and other eligible plans. In addition, we make a 4% matching contribution to the EDCP on base pay contributions in excess of IRS limits up to a  maximum of two times that limit (maximum of $11,400 in calendar 2020). This is the same percentage of matching contributions those executives  are eligible to receive under the 401(k) Plan. In effect, the EDCP permits these executives and all eligible employees to receive a 401(k)-type  matching contribution on a portion of base-pay deferrals in excess of IRS limits. Amounts deferred or matched under the EDCP are credited with  hypothetical investment earnings based on investment options selected by the participant from among nearly all the proprietary funds available to  employees under the 401(k) Plan. No amounts earn above-market returns. Benefits payable under the EDCP are unfunded and unsecured. Executives are also eligible to have a yearly HP-paid medical exam as part of the HP U.S. executive physical program. This includes a  comprehensive exam, thorough health assessment and personalized health advice. This benefit is also offered by our peer group companies. Consistent with its practice of not providing any special or supplemental executive defined benefit programs, including arrangements that would  otherwise provide special benefits to the family of a deceased executive, in 2011 the HRC Committee adopted a policy that, unless approved by  our stockholders pursuant to an advisory vote, we will not enter into a new plan, program or agreement or modify an existing plan, program or  agreement with a Section 16 officer (including the NEOs) that provides for payments, grants or awards following the death of the officer in the  form of unearned salary or unearned annual incentives, accelerated vesting or the continuation in force of unvested equity grants, perquisites,  and other payments or awards made in lieu of compensation, except to the extent that such payments, grants or awards are provided or made  available to our employees generally. We provide our executives with financial counseling services to assist them in obtaining professional financial advice, a common benefit among  our peer group companies, for convenience and to increase the understanding and effectiveness of our executive compensation program. Limited Perquisites We provide a small number of perquisites to our senior executives, including the NEOs. For a list of all perquisites provided to our NEOs for fiscal  2020, please refer to the All Other Compensation Table on page 61. Due to our global presence, we maintain one corporate aircraft. In the event an NEO is accompanied by a guest or family member on the aircraft  for personal reasons, as approved by the CEO, the NEO is taxed on the value of this usage according to the relevant Code rules. We do not provide  tax gross-up for the imputed income attributable to personal use. Among our NEOs, Mr. Lores is the only executive that used the corporate  aircraft for personal use during fiscal 2020, which was for convenience and security. Our Audit Committee periodically conducts global risk management reviews, which include reviewing home security services of NEOs. Services  considered necessary by the Audit Committee may be paid for by HP, due to the range of security issues that may be encountered by key  executives of any large, multinational corporation. The HRC Committee is focused on ensuring that the severance and change of control protections available to our executives are consistent with  market practice, provide clarity to prospective and current executives, and will help attract and retain talent. Consistent with this approach, our  Section 16 officers (including all of the NEOs) are covered by the Amended and Restated Severance and Long-term Incentive Change in Control  Plan for Executive Officers (“SPEO”), as amended on February 28, 2020. During fiscal 2020, the HRC Committee undertook a review of the SPEO  taking into consideration market data and recommendations provided by FW Cook and external counsel. Approved changes are aligned with  market practice and support the objectives of the SPEO plan and overall compensation program. The SPEO is intended to protect our executives  and our stockholders, and provide a level of transition assistance in the event of an involuntary termination of employment. Under the SPEO, participants who incur an involuntary termination (i.e., a termination not for cause), and who execute a full and effective release  of claims following such termination, are eligible to receive severance benefits in an amount determined as a multiple of base pay, plus the  average of either the actual annual incentives paid for the preceding three years or target bonus if the executive has received less than three full  fiscal year annual cash bonuses at his or her seniority level as of immediately prior to such termination. In the case of the NEOs other than the  CEO, the multiplier is 1.5. In the case of the CEO, the multiplier is 2.0. In all cases, this benefit will not exceed 2.99 times the sum of the executive’s  base pay plus target annual incentive as in effect immediately prior to the termination of employment. Although most of the compensation for our executives is performance-based and largely contingent upon the achievement of financial goals, the  HRC Committee continues to believe that the SPEO is appropriate for the attraction and retention of executive talent. In addition, we find it more  equitable to offer severance benefits based on a standard formula for the Section 16 officers (including all of the NEOs) because severance often  serves as a bridge when employment is involuntarily terminated, and should therefore not be affected by other, longer-term accumulations. As a  result, and consistent with the practice of our peer group companies, other compensation decisions are not generally based on the existence of  this severance protection. 56 www.hpannualmeeting.com In addition to the cash benefit, SPEO participants are eligible to receive (1) a pro-rata annual incentive for the year of termination based on actual  performance results, at the discretion of the HRC Committee, (2) pro-rata vesting of unvested equity awards (and for performance-based equity  awards, only if any applicable performance conditions have been satisfied), and (3) payment of a lump-sum health-benefit stipend of an amount  equal to 18 months’ COBRA premiums for continued group medical coverage for the executive and his or her eligible dependents. In order to better ensure the retention of our Executive Leadership team in the event of a potentially disruptive corporate transaction, the SPEO also  includes change in control terms for our NEOs. The benefits provided for involuntary terminations under the SPEO are also provided in connection  with a voluntary termination for Good Reason (as defined in the plan) that occurs within 24 months after a change in control (“double trigger”), and  in situations where equity awards are not assumed by the surviving corporation (a “modified double trigger”). In addition, the SPEO provides for full  vesting of outstanding stock options, RSUs, and PARSUs upon involuntary termination not for Cause or voluntary termination for Good Reason within  24 months after a change in control, and in situations where equity awards are not assumed by the surviving corporation. The SPEO further provides  that under either a double trigger or modified double trigger, PARSUs will vest based on actual performance with respect to the awards for which the  applicable performance period has ended or target performance with respect to the awards for which the applicable performance period has not  ended. In addition, in the event of any dispute under the SPEO relating to a participant’s termination of employment within 24 months following a  change in control, the Company will reimburse all related legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the participant if claims are brought in good  faith. We do not provide tax gross ups in connection with terminations, including terminations in the event of a change in control. Among the HRC Committee’s responsibilities described in its charter is to oversee succession planning and leadership development. The Board  plans for succession of the CEO and annually reviews senior management selection and succession planning that is undertaken by the HRC  Committee. As part of this process, the independent Directors annually review the HRC Committee’s recommended candidates for senior  management positions to see that qualified candidates are available for all positions and that development plans are being utilized to strengthen  the skills and qualifications of the candidates. The criteria used when assessing the qualifications of potential CEO successors include, among  others, strategic vision and leadership, operational excellence, financial management, executive officer leadership development, ability to  motivate employees, and an ability to develop an effective working relationship with the Board. We also host a Board Buddy program through  which each executive officer is aligned to a board member as a mentor to aid the executive’s development while giving board members a deeper  understanding of the day-to-day operations of the Company. In fiscal 2020, an executive talent review was conducted along with succession plans for each of the executive leaders. Successors were identified  to reflect necessary skill sets, performance, potential, and diversity. Development plans for successors were also established to ensure readiness  and will be managed throughout the year. In addition to the annual succession planning process, the HRC Committee participates in an in-depth  performance discussion of each executive officer at the time of the annual compensation review. Further, there is a People Update at each HRC  Committee meeting, which includes a review of key people processes and developments for that quarter. In addition, the executive team participated in a robust development process that included individual assessments, interviews with executive  coaches, and an individualized development plan that can be leveraged throughout the year. Development themes for the entire executive team  will be addressed during quarterly face-to-face meetings for full team development. Our stock ownership guidelines are designed to align executives’ interests with those of our stockholders and mitigate compensation-related risk.  The current guidelines provide that, within five years of assuming a designated position, the CEO should attain an investment position in our stock  equal to seven times his base salary and all other Section 16 officers reporting directly to the CEO should attain an investment position equal to  five times their base salaries. Shares counted toward these guidelines include any shares held by the executive directly or through a broker, shares  held through the 401(k) Plan, shares held as restricted stock, shares underlying time-vested RSUs, and shares underlying vested but unexercised  stock options (50% of the in-the-money value of such options is used for this calculation). We do not include shares in ongoing PARSU cycles. Our  NEOs are on pace to meet the stock ownership guidelines within the allotted time frame. The HRC Committee has adopted a policy prohibiting all employees, including executive officers, and Directors from engaging in any form of  hedging transaction (derivatives, equity swaps, forwards, etc.) involving Company securities, including, among other things, short sales and  transactions involving publicly traded options. In addition, with limited exceptions, our executive officers are prohibited from holding our securities  in margin accounts and from pledging our securities as collateral for loans. We believe that these policies further align our executives’ interests  with those of our stockholders. In fiscal 2006, the Board adopted a “clawback” policy that provides Board discretion to recover certain annual incentives from senior executives  (including the NEOs) whose fraud or misconduct resulted in a significant restatement of financial results. The policy specifically allows for the  recovery of annual incentives paid at or above target from those senior executives whose fraud or misconduct resulted in the restatement where  the annual incentives would have been lower absent the fraud or misconduct, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Additionally, our incentive  plan document (and award agreements) allows for the recoupment of performance-based annual incentives and long-term incentives consistent  with applicable law and the clawback policy. Also, in fiscal 2014, we added a provision to our grant agreements to clarify that equity awards are subject to the clawback policy. Award  agreements also provide Board discretion to cause forfeiture of certain outstanding cash and equity awards for fraud or misconduct that results  in reputational harm to HP even when such fraud or misconduct does not result in a significant restatement of financial results. The impact of accounting treatment is considered in developing and implementing our compensation programs, including the accounting  treatment as it applies to amounts awarded or paid to our executives. The impact of federal tax laws on our compensation programs is also considered, including the deductibility of compensation paid to the NEOs,  as limited by Section 162(m) of the Code. For prior fiscal years, Section 162(m) included an exception from the deductibility limitation for qualified  “performance-based compensation.” This exception, however, has been repealed for tax years beginning in fiscal 2019 under the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act. As such, compensation paid to certain of our executive officers in excess of $1.0 million is not deductible unless it qualifies for certain  transition relief applicable for compensation paid pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect as of November 2, 2017. In addition,  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act increased the scope of individuals subject to the deduction limitation. Thus, compensation originally intended to  satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) may not be fully deductible. Although our compensation program may take into  consideration the Section 162(m) rules as a factor, these considerations will not necessarily limit compensation to amounts deductible under  Section 162(m). Despite the modifications to Section 162(m), the HRC Committee intends to continue to implement compensation programs that  it believes are competitive and in the best interests of HP and its stockholders. The HRC Committee of the Board of HP has reviewed and discussed with management this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Based on this  review and discussion, it has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and  in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of HP filed for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. Stephanie A. Burns, Chair  Aida Alvarez  Shumeet Banerji  Charles “Chip” V. Bergh  Stacey Mobley 58 www.hpannualmeeting.com The following table sets forth information concerning the compensation of our NEOs for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, as applicable. Per SEC  reporting guidelines, our NEOs for fiscal 2020 include our CEO (Mr. Lores), our current CFO (Ms. Myers), our former CFO (Mr. Fieler), and the next  three most highly compensated individuals serving as executive officers at year end (Mr. Schell, Ms. Rivera, and Mr. Cho) as of the last day of the  fiscal year (October 31, 2020). (1)  Mr. Fieler stepped down as our Chief Financial Officer and left the Company on October 2, 2020. Myers was appointed to the role of Acting Chief Financial  Officer effective October 1, 2020, while continuing to lead our Transformation and IT organization. On February 17, 2021, Ms. Myers was appointed as Chief  Financial Officer of the Company. (2)  Ms. Rivera stepped down as President, Strategy and Business Management and Chief Legal Officer, effective February 1, 2021. Since stepping down from such  positions, Ms. Rivera has continued to be employed by the Company as Special Advisor to the CEO, a non-executive officer role. (3)  Amounts shown represent base salary earned or paid during the fiscal year and take into account reductions in each NEO’s annual base salary in response  to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as described under the heading “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Determination of Fiscal 2020 Executive  Compensation—2020 Base Salary.” Mr. Fieler’s amount includes $91,105 for accrued and unused floating holidays and vacation days that was paid out in  connection with his departure from the Company.

In the case of RSUs, the value is  determined by multiplying the number of units granted by the closing price of our stock on the grant date. For PARSUs awarded in fiscal 2020, they include  both internal (EPS) and market-related (TSR) performance goals as described under the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Determination of Fiscal  2020 Executive Compensation—Long-Term Incentive Compensation”. Amounts shown reflect the grant date fair value of the 2020 PARSUs for its first  tranche of the EPS with fiscal 2020 based on the probable outcome of performance conditions related to these PARSUs at the grant date. Consistent with the  applicable accounting standards, the grant date fair value of the market related TSR modifier has been determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model.  Further, consistent with accounting standards, grant date fair value reflects the EPS portion of the award for Year 1 only, for which goals were approved in  January 2020. This value also reflects grant date fair value of the EPS portion of the 2019 PARSU award for Year 2 (fiscal 2020 EPS) and the EPS portion of the  2018 PARSU award for Year 3 (fiscal 2020 EPS), for which goals were approved in January 2020. The table below sets forth the grant date fair value for the  2020 PARSUs granted on December 6, 2019; the fiscal 2020 EPS portion of the 2019 PARSUs granted on December 7, 2018 and the fiscal 2020 EPS portion of  the 2018 PARSUs granted on December 7, 2017 (July 1, 2018 for Mr. Cho and Mr. Fieler). Fieler’s PARSU grants were forfeited following his departure from  the Company in October 2020, and Ms. Myers only received RSUs (new hire grant) and did not receive any PARSU grants during fiscal 2020: (5)  Amounts shown represent payouts under the annual PfR incentive (amounts earned during the applicable fiscal year but paid after the end of that fiscal year).  Mr. Fieler left the Company on October 2, 2020 and was not eligible to receive the annual PfR. (6)  Amounts shown represent the increase in the actuarial present value of NEO pension benefits during the applicable fiscal year. As described in more detail  under the heading “Narrative to the Fiscal 2020 Pension Benefits Table” below, pension accruals have generally ceased for all NEOs, and NEOs hired after the  dates that pension accruals ceased are not eligible to participate in any U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The only exception for the NEOs listed above is that  Mr. Cho participates in the International Retirement Guarantee (IRG), which is provided to a small, closed group of employees who have transferred between  countries with pension/retirement indemnity plans. Cho will not accrue additional benefits under the IRG unless he transfers outside of the US with HP Inc.  for an extended period of time. Accordingly, the amounts reported for the NEOs do not reflect additional accruals but reflect the passage of one more year  from the prior present value calculation and changes in other actuarial assumptions. The assumptions used in calculating the changes in pension benefits  are described in footnote (2) to the “Fiscal 2020 Pension Benefits Table” below. No HP plan provides for above-market earnings on deferred compensation  amounts, so the amounts reported in this column do not reflect any such earnings. (7)  The amounts shown are detailed in the “Fiscal 2020 All Other Compensation Table” below. 60 www.hpannualmeeting.com *  Amounts shown represent the grant date fair value of the PARSUs subject to the internal EPS performance goal (i) based on the probable or target  outcome as of the date the goals were set and (ii) based on achieving the maximum level of performance for the performance period beginning in  fiscal 2020. The grant date fair value of the 2020 PARSUs Year 1 EPS units awarded on December 6, 2019, 2019 PARSUs Year 2 EPS units awarded on  December 7, 2018 and 2018 PARSUs Year 3 EPS units awarded on December 7, 2017 (or for Mr. Fieler’s and Mr. Cho’s grants, on July 1, 2018) was $21.42  per unit, which was the closing share price of our common stock on January 15, 2020 when the EPS goal was approved. The values of 2020 PARSUs Year  2 and Year 3 EPS units will not be available until January 2021 and January 2022 respectively, and therefore are not included for fiscal 2020, but will be  included for their respective fiscal years. ** Amounts shown represent the grant date fair value of PARSUs subject to the market related TSR modifier of the PARSUs, for which expense recognition  is not subject to probable or maximum outcome assumptions. The grant date fair value of the market related TSR modifier of the PARSUs granted  December 6, 2019 was $1.55 per unit, which was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The significant assumptions used in this simulation  model were a volatility rate of 27.6%, a risk-free interest rate of 1.6%, and a simulation period of 2.9 years. For information on the assumptions used to  calculate the fair value of the awards, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  October 31, 2020, as filed with the SEC on December 10, 2020.

(5)  Represents the value of personal usage of HP corporate aircraft. For purposes of reporting the value of such personal usage in this table, we use data provided  by an outside firm to calculate the hourly cost of operating each type of aircraft. These costs include the cost of fuel, maintenance, landing and parking fees,  crew, catering and supplies. For trips by NEOs that involve mixed personal and business usage, we include the incremental cost of such personal usage (i.e.,  the excess of the cost of the actual trip over the cost of a hypothetical trip without the personal usage). For income tax purposes, the amounts included in NEO  income are calculated based on the standard industry fare level valuation method. No tax gross ups are provided for this imputed income. (6)  Includes amounts paid either directly to the executives or on their behalf for financial counseling, tax preparation and estate planning services. For Ms. Rivera,  the amount includes $8,660 for financial counseling services that was incurred in fiscal 2019 but not billed until fiscal 2020. (1)  Represents matching contributions made under the HP 401(k) Plan that were earned for 2020. (2)  Represents matching contributions credited during fiscal 2020 under the HP Executive Deferred Compensation Plan with respect to the 2019 calendar year of  that plan. (3)  For Ms. Rivera, represents benefits provided under our domestic executive mobility program. For Mr. Lores, represents tax preparation, filing, equalization and  compliance services paid under HP’s tax assistance due to business travel in Korea. Due to the taxation impact on US taxpayers who travel to Korea on business  and the increase in Korea travel due to our acquisition of Samsung’s Print business, the HRC Committee approved a Tax Assistance Program during its July 2017  meeting that covers our Section 16 officers. The program has the same characteristics as the existing tax equalization program for all other employees. Both  programs together ensure a tax neutral scenario for all HP employees who must comply with Korean tax requirements due to business travel to Korea. (4)  Represents home security services provided to the NEOs and, consistent with SEC guidance, the expense is reported here as a perquisite since there is  an incidental personal benefit. The amount reported for Mr. Lores reflects the cost of security services, based on an overall assessment completed by an  independent consultant and approved by the HRC Committee in June 2020.

In the  case of Ms. Myers, the range of possible cash payments is prorated to reflect her actual service during the year following her commencement of employment. (2)  For the 2018 and 2019 PARSUs, amounts represent the range of shares that may be released at the end of the two- and three-year vesting periods applicable  to the PARSUs assuming achievement of threshold, target, or maximum performance. 50% of the PARSUs are eligible for vesting based on EPS performance and  50% are eligible for vesting based on relative TSR performance. PARSUs vest as follows: 16.6% of the units are eligible for vesting based on EPS performance of  year one with continued service over two years, 16.6% of the units are eligible for vesting based on EPS performance of year two with continued service over three  years, 16.6% of the units are eligible for vesting based on EPS performance of year three with continued service over three years, 25% of the units are eligible for  vesting based on TSR performance over two years with continued service over two years, 25% of the units are eligible for vesting based on relative TSR PARSU  performance over three years with continued service over three years. For the 2020 PARSUs, amounts represent the range of shares that may be released at the  end of the three-year vesting period applicable to the PARSUs assuming achievement of threshold, target, or maximum performance.

The TSR units for PARSUs granted in fiscal 2019 are reported based on threshold performance (50%), and the EPS units for PARSUs granted in fiscal  2020 are reported based on maximum (200%) performance. Actual payout will be on achievement of performance goals at the end of the three-year vesting period. (6)  Mr. Fieler has no outstanding equity awards as all unvested shares were forfeited when he departed the Company. (1)  Option exercise prices are the fair market value of our stock on the grant date. In connection with the separation of HPE and in accordance with the employee  matters agreement, HP made certain adjustments to the exercise price and number of stock-based compensation awards with the intention of preserving the  intrinsic value of the awards prior to the separation. Exercisable and non-exercisable stock options were converted to similar awards of the entity where the  employee was working post-separation. (2)  All options have an eight-year term. (3)  The amounts in this column include shares underlying dividend equivalent units credited with respect to outstanding stock awards through October 31, 2020.  The amounts also include PARSUs granted in fiscal 2019 (Year 2 EPS units) plus accrued dividend equivalent shares. The 2019 PARSUs Year 2 EPS units are  reported based on actual performance since those results have been certified (fiscal 2020 EPS period).

(2)  Represents the amounts realized based on the difference between the market price of HP stock on the date of grant and the exercise price. (3)  Represents the amounts realized based on the fair market value of our stock on the performance period end date for PARSUs (October 31, 2020) and on  the vesting date for RSUs and accrued dividend equivalent shares. Fair market value is determined based on the closing price of our stock on the applicable  performance period end/vesting date. (1)  The “RP” and the “EBP” are the qualified HP Retirement Plan and the non-qualified HP Excess Benefit Plan, respectively. “CAPP” is the qualified Cash Account  Pension Plan. All benefits are frozen under these plans. The RP and CAPP have been merged into the HP Inc. Pension Plan (formerly known as the Hewlett- Packard Company Retirement Plan). The “IRG” is the International Retirement Guarantee which is a nonqualified plan covering certain highly compensated  international transfers. (2)  The present value of accumulated benefits is shown at the age 65 unreduced retirement age for the RP, the EBP and the IRG, and the immediate unreduced  benefit from the CAPP using the assumptions under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 715-30 Defined Benefit Plans—Pension for the 2020 fiscal  year-end measurement (as of October 31, 2020). The present value is based on a discount rate of 2.77% for the RP (this discount rate also applies for CAPP  but since the benefit is currently unreduced, there is no discounting applied), 1.44% for the EBP and 1.34% for the IRG, lump sum interest rates of 0.51% for  the first five years, 2.31% for the next 15 years and 3.15% thereafter, and applicable mortality for lump sums with the respective mortality improvement scale  applied for future years. As of October 31, 2019 (the prior measurement date), the ASC Topic 715-30 assumptions included a discount rate of 3.21% for the  RP, 2.39% for the EBP, and 2.50% for the IRG, lump sum interest rates of 2.13% for the first five years, 3.07% for the next 15 years and 3.65% thereafter, and  applicable mortality for lump sums with the respective mortality improvement scale applied for future years. (3)  Mr. Lores, Mr. Schell, and Ms. Rivera are not eligible to receive benefits under any defined benefit pension plan because we ceased benefit accruals under all of  our U.S.-qualified defined benefit pension plans prior to the commencement of their employment with HP in the United States. (4)  Ms. Myers was a participant in the RP and EBP, but when she previously left the Company, she was paid her RP and EBP benefits (in the 2019 fiscal year).

Lores(3) — — — — No NEO currently accrues a benefit under any qualified or non-qualified defined benefit pension plan because we ceased benefit accruals in all  our U.S.-qualified defined benefit pension plans (and their non-qualified plan counterparts) in prior years. In the case of Mr. Cho, his IRG benefit is  based on the US retirement program and since the US pension plans are frozen there is no accrual under that plan. Benefits previously accrued by  Mr. Fieler under CAPP and those accrued by Mr. Cho under the RP, EBP and IRG are payable to them following termination of employment, subject  to the terms of the applicable plans. Cho earned benefits under the RP and the EBP based on pay and service prior to 2006. The RP is a traditional defined benefit plan that provided a  benefit based on years of service and the participant’s “highest average pay rate,” reduced by a portion of Social Security earnings. “Highest average pay  rate” was determined based on the 20 consecutive fiscal quarters when pay was the highest. Pay for this purpose included base pay and bonus, subject  to applicable IRS limits. Benefits under the RP may be taken in one of several different annuity forms or in an actuarially equivalent lump sum. Since  Mr. Cho became a participant in the RP after November 1, 1993, he has no Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (DPSP) balance to be integrated with the RP. Benefits not payable from the RP due to IRS limits are paid from the EBP under which benefits are unfunded and unsecured. When an EBP  participant with relatively small benefits terminates they are paid their EBP benefit in January of the year following their termination, subject to  any delay required by Section 409A of the Code. Fieler earned benefits under the CAPP based on his compensation beginning in September 2004 through the end of 2005, when benefits  were frozen. While interest continues to accrue on the CAPP balance, no pay credits have been applied since the end of 2005. CAPP provided for  4% of pay credits to a cash balance account with interest credited at a 1-year Treasury bill plus 1% interest rate. The CAPP balance can be paid as  a lump sum with the appropriate election and spousal consent if married or can be converted to annuity forms of payment. Employees who transferred internationally at the Company’s request prior to 2000 were put into an international umbrella plan. This plan  determines the country of guarantee which is generally the country in which an employee has spent the longest portion of his HP Inc. career.  For Mr. Cho, the country of guarantee is currently the U.S. The IRG determines the present value of a full career benefit for Mr. Cho under the  HP Inc. sponsored retirement benefit plans that applied to employees working in the U.S., and U.S. Social Security (since the U.S. is his country  of guarantee) then offsets the present value of the retirement benefits from plans and social insurance systems in the countries in which he  earned retirement benefits (France and the US) for his total period of HP Inc. employment. The net benefit value is payable as a single lump sum  amount as soon as practicable after termination or retirement, subject to any delay required by Section 409A of the Code. This is a nonqualified  retirement plan. (1)  The amounts reported here as “Executive Contributions” and “Registrant Contributions” are reported as compensation to such NEO in the “Salary” and “Non- Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” columns in the “Summary Compensation Table” above. (2)  The contributions reported here as “Registrant Contributions” were made in fiscal 2020 with respect to calendar year 2019 participant base pay deferrals.  During fiscal 2020, the NEOs were eligible to receive a 4% matching contribution on base pay deferrals that exceeded the IRS limit that applies to the qualified  HP 401(k) Plan up to a maximum of two times that limit. (3)  The distributions reported here were made pursuant to participant elections made prior to the time that the amounts were deferred in accordance with plan rules. (4)  Of these balances, the following amount was reported as compensation to such NEO in the Summary Compensation Table in prior proxy statements: Mr. Lores  $1,251,677, Ms. Myers $0, Mr. Fieler $9,932, Mr. Schell $0, Ms. Rivera $8,840, and Mr. Cho $15,240. The information reported in this footnote is provided to  clarify the extent to which amounts payable as deferred compensation represent compensation reported in our prior proxy statements, rather than additional  earned compensation.

In addition, a matching contribution is available under the plan to eligible employees. The matching contribution  applies to base pay deferrals on compensation above the IRS limit that applies to the qualified HP 401(k) Plan, up to a maximum of two times  that compensation limit (matching contributions made in fiscal year 2020 pertained to base pay from $280,000 to $560,000 during calendar  year 2019). During fiscal 2020, the NEOs were eligible for a matching contribution of up to 4% on base pay contributions in excess of the IRS limit,  up to a maximum of two times that limit. Upon becoming eligible for participation or during the annual enrollment period, employees must specify the amount of base pay and/or the  percentage of bonus to be deferred, as well as the time and form of payment. If termination of employment occurs before retirement (defined  as at least age 55 with 15 years of continuous service), distribution is made in the form of a lump sum in January of the year following the  year of termination, subject to any delay required under Section 409A of the Code. At retirement (or earlier, if properly elected), benefits are  paid according to the distribution election made by the participant at the time of the deferral election, subject to any delay required under  Section 409A of the Code. As of the end of fiscal 2020, Mr. Lores was the only NEO who was retirement eligible. In the event of death, the  remaining vested EDCP account balance will be paid to the designated beneficiary, or otherwise in accordance with the EDCP provisions, in a single  lump-sum payment in the month following the month of death. Amounts deferred or credited under the EDCP are credited with hypothetical investment earnings based on participant investment elections  made from among the investment options available under the HP 401(k) Plan. Accounts maintained for participants under the EDCP are not held  in trust, and all such accounts are subject to the claims of general creditors of HP. No amounts are credited with above-market earnings. The amounts in the following table estimate potential payments due if a NEO had terminated employment with HP effective October 31, 2020 under  each of the circumstances specified below. These amounts are in addition to benefits generally available to U.S. employees upon termination of  employment, such as distributions from the retirement plans and the HP 401(k) Plan and payment of accrued vacation where required. 66 www.hpannualmeeting.com Enrique J.

(2)  The amounts reported are the cash benefits payable in the event of a qualifying termination under the SPEO: for CEO, 2x multiple of base pay plus either the  average of the actual annual incentives paid for the preceding three years, or target bonus if less than three full years at the level by the end of the fiscal year;  for other NEOs, 1.5x multiple of base pay plus either the average of the actual annual incentives paid for the preceding three years, or target bonus if less than  three full years at the level by the end of the fiscal year; and includes 18 months’ COBRA premiums for continued group medical coverage for the NEOs and  their eligible dependents. In addition, each NEO would be eligible to receive a pro-rata cash bonus based on actual performance (in the event of a qualifying  termination outside of the context of a change in control) or based on target performance (in the event of a qualifying termination within 24 months of a  change in control); such amounts have not been included in this column. (3)  Upon an involuntary termination not for cause, covered executives receive pro-rata vesting on unvested equity awards as discussed under the heading  “Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Severance and Long-term Incentive Change in Control Plan for Executive Officers.” Full  vesting of PARSUs based on performance at target levels (to the extent that the actual performance period has not been completed) applies in the event of a  termination due to death or disability for all grant recipients. Pro-rata vesting of PARSUs based on actual performance applies in the event of a termination due  to retirement for all grant recipients. To calculate the value of unvested PARSUs for purposes of this table, target performance is used unless the performance  period has been completed and the results have been certified. Full vesting of unvested PCSOs applies in the event of a termination due to death or disability  for all grant recipients. With respect to the treatment of equity in the event of a change in control of HP, the information reported reflects the SPEO-approved  change in control terms. As of the end of the fiscal year 2020, only Mr. Lores is retirement eligible. (4)  As of the end of fiscal 2020, Mr. Lores is retirement eligible (a minimum age of 55 plus years of service equal to or greater than 70 points). (5)  Ms. Rivera stepped down as President, Strategy and Business Management and Chief Legal Officer, effective February 1, 2021. Since stepping down from  such positions, Ms. Rivera has continued to be employed by the Company as Special Advisor to the CEO, a non-executive officer role. In connection with this  transition, Ms. Rivera entered into an agreement with the Company, pursuant to which Ms. Rivera will continue to be paid her annual base salary through  December 31, 2021, her previously granted equity awards will continue to vest in accordance with their terms through such date, and she will be paid an annual  cash bonus at target for fiscal year 2021, in each case subject to the terms of such agreement. Upon her termination, Ms. Rivera will be eligible to receive,  unless terminated for cause, severance benefits which are consistent with the severance benefits provided for under the SPEO, as described under “Executive  Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Severance and Long-term Incentive Change in Control Plan for Executive Officers.” Fieler stepped down as our Chief Financial Officer and left the Company on October 2, 2020. Given that Mr. Fieler’s departure was a voluntary  resignation, he did not receive any severance payments or benefits in connection with his departure. He also did not receive any accelerated  vesting of his outstanding equity awards. An executive will be deemed to have incurred a qualifying termination for purposes of the SPEO if he or she is involuntarily terminated without  cause and executes a full release of claims in a form satisfactory to HP promptly following termination. For purposes of the SPEO, “cause” means  an executive’s conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony under federal law or the law of the state in which such action occurred;  executive’s willful and deliberate failure in the performance of the executive’s duties in any material respect; executive’s willful misconduct that  results in material harm to HP; or a material violation of HP’s ethics and compliance program, code of conduct or other material policy of HP. The  material terms of the SPEO are described under the heading “Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Severance and  Long-term Incentive Change in Control Plan for Executive Officers.” Kim M.

An NEO who terminated employment before October 31, 2020, either voluntarily or in a “for cause” termination, would generally  not have been eligible to receive any amount under the annual PfR incentive with respect to the fiscal year in which the termination occurred,  except that the HRC Committee has the discretion to make payment of prorated bonus amounts to individuals on leave of absence or in non-pay  status, as well as in connection with certain voluntary severance incentives, workforce reductions, and similar programs. A “not for cause” termination of an NEO who remained employed through October 31, 2020 and was terminated immediately thereafter would  qualify the NEO for the amounts described above under a “voluntary” termination in addition to benefits under the SPEO if the NEO signs the  required release of claims in favor of HP. In addition to the cash severance benefits and pro-rata equity awards payable under the SPEO, the NEO would be eligible to exercise vested stock  options up to one year after termination and receive distributions of vested, accrued benefits from HP deferred compensation and pension plans. In the event of a change in control of HP, RSUs, stock options, and PCSOs will vest in full if the successor does not assume such awards or if an  individual is terminated without Cause or terminates with Good Reason within 24 months of a change in control. Under each scenario, outstanding  PARSUs will vest in full with vesting based on actual performance with respect to awards for which the performance period has ended and target  performance level with respect to awards for which the performance period has not ended, as determined by the Committee within 30 days of  change in control. An NEO who continued in employment through October 31, 2020 whose employment is terminated immediately thereafter due to death or  disability would be eligible (1) to receive his or her full annual incentive amount earned for fiscal 2020 under the annual PfR incentive determined  by HP in its sole discretion, (2) to receive a distribution of vested amounts deferred or credited under the EDCP, and (3) to receive a distribution of  his or her vested benefits under the HP 401(k) and pension plans. Upon termination due to death or disability, equity awards held by the NEO may vest in full. If termination is due to disability, RSUs, stock options,  and PCSOs will vest in full, subject to satisfaction of applicable performance conditions, and, in the case of stock options and PCSOs, must  be exercised within three years of termination or by the original expiration date, if earlier; all unvested portions of the PARSUs, including any  amounts for dividend equivalent payments, shall vest based on performance at target levels. If termination is due to the NEO’s death, RSUs, stock  options, and PCSOs will vest in full and, in the case of stock options and PCSOs, must be exercised within one year of termination or by the original  expiration date, if earlier; all unvested portions of the PARSUs, including any amounts for dividend equivalent payments, shall vest based on  performance at target levels. Under the HP Severance Policy for Senior Executives adopted by the Board in July 2003 (the “HP Severance Policy”), HP will seek stockholder  approval for future severance agreements, if any, with certain senior executives that provide specified benefits in an amount exceeding  2.99 times the sum of the executive’s current annual base salary plus annual target cash bonus, in each case as in effect immediately prior to the  time of such executive’s termination. Individuals subject to this policy consist of the Section 16 officers designated by the Board. In implementing  this policy, the Board may elect to seek stockholder approval after the material terms of the relevant severance agreement are agreed upon. For purposes of determining the amounts subject to the HP Severance Policy, benefits subject to the limit generally include cash separation  payments that directly relate to extraordinary benefits that are not available to groups of employees other than the Section 16 officers upon  termination of employment. Benefits that have been earned or accrued, as well as prorated bonuses, accelerated stock or option vesting, and  other benefits that are consistent with our practices applicable to employees other than the Section 16 officers, are not counted against the limit.  Specifically, benefits subject to the HP Severance Policy include: (a) separation payments based on a multiplier of salary plus target bonus, or cash  amounts payable for the uncompleted portion of employment agreements; (b) the value of any service period credited to a Section 16 officer in 68 www.hpannualmeeting.com excess of the period of service actually provided by such Section 16 officer for purposes of any employee benefit plan; (c) the value of benefits  and perquisites that are inconsistent with our practices applicable to one or more groups of employees in addition to, or other than, the Section 16  officers (“Company Practices”); and (d) the value of any accelerated vesting of any stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs,  or long-term cash incentives that is inconsistent with Company Practices. The following benefits are not subject to the HP Severance Policy, either  because they have been previously earned or accrued by the employee or because they are consistent with Company Practices: (i) compensation  and benefits earned, accrued, deferred or otherwise provided for employment services rendered on or prior to the date of termination of  employment pursuant to bonus, retirement, deferred compensation, or other benefit plans (e.g., 401(k) Plan distributions, payments pursuant  to retirement plans, distributions under deferred compensation plans or payments for accrued benefits such as unused vacation days), and any  amounts earned with respect to such compensation and benefits in accordance with the terms of the applicable plan; (ii) payments of prorated  portions of bonuses or prorated long-term incentive payments that are consistent with Company Practices; (iii) acceleration of the vesting of stock  options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs or long-term cash incentives that is consistent with Company Practices; (iv) payments or  benefits required to be provided by law; and (v) benefits and perquisites provided in accordance with the terms of any benefit plan, program, or  arrangement sponsored by HP or its affiliates that are consistent with Company Practices. For purposes of the HP Severance Policy, future severance agreements include any severance agreements or employment agreements  containing severance provisions that we may enter into after the adoption of the HP Severance Policy by the Board, as well as agreements  renewing, modifying, or extending such agreements. Future severance agreements do not include retirement plans, deferred compensation  plans, early retirement plans, workforce restructuring plans, retention plans in connection with extraordinary transactions, or similar plans or  agreements entered into in connection with any of the foregoing, provided that such plans or agreements are applicable to one or more groups of  employees in addition to the Section 16 officers. Upon retirement immediately after October 31, 2020 with a minimum age of 55 and years of combined age and service equal to or greater than  70, HP employees in the United States receive full vesting of time-based options (other than options granted under a retention agreement on or  after June 25, 2019) granted under our stock plans with a post-termination exercise period of up to three years or the original expiration date,  whichever comes first, as well as full vesting of RSUs (other than RSUs granted under a retention agreement on or after June 25, 2019). Awards  under the PARSU program, if any, are paid on a prorated basis to participants at the end of the performance period based on actual results, and  bonuses, if any, under the annual PfR incentive plan may be paid in prorated amounts at the discretion of management based on actual results. In  accordance with Section 409A of the Code, certain amounts payable upon retirement (or other termination) of the NEOs and other key employees  will not be paid out for at least six months following termination of employment. As of the end of fiscal 2020, Mr. Lores was the only NEO who  was retirement eligible. We sponsor two retiree medical programs in the United States, one of which provides subsidized coverage for eligible participants based on years  of service. Eligibility for this program requires that participants have been continuously employed by HP since January 1, 2003 and have met  other age and service requirements. None of the NEOs are eligible for this program. The other U.S. retiree medical program we sponsor provides eligible retirees with access to coverage at group rates only, with no direct subsidy  provided by HP. All the NEOs could be eligible for this program if they retire from HP on or after age 55 with at least ten years of qualifying service  or if they retire at any age with combined age plus service equal to 80 or more years. In addition, beginning at age 45, eligible U.S. employees may  participate in the HP Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan (the “RMSA”), under which certain participants are eligible to receive HP matching  credits of up to $1,200 per year, up to a lifetime maximum of $12,000, which can be used to cover the cost of such retiree medical coverage  (or other qualifying medical expenses) if the employee meets the eligibility requirements for HP retiree medical benefits. None of the NEOs are  currently receiving the HP matching credits under the RMSA. The following table summarizes our equity compensation plan information as of October 31, 2020. (1)  This column does not reflect awards of options and RSUs assumed in acquisitions where the plans governing the awards were not available for future awards  as of October 31, 2020. As of October 31, 2020, there were no individual awards of options or RSUs outstanding pursuant to awards assumed in connection  with acquisitions and granted under such plans. (2)  This column does not reflect the exercise price of shares underlying the assumed options referred to in footnote (1) to this table or the purchase price of shares  to be purchased pursuant to the HP Inc. 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2011 ESPP”) or the legacy HP Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Legacy  ESPP”). In addition, the weighted-average exercise price does not take into account the shares issuable upon vesting of outstanding awards of RSUs and  PARSUs, which have no exercise price. (3)  Includes awards of options and RSUs outstanding under the 2004 Plan and 2011 ESPP. Also includes awards of PARSUs representing 2,879,350 shares that  may be issued under the 2004 Plan. Each PARSU award reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient. HP determines the actual  number of shares the recipient receives at the end of a three-year performance period based on results achieved compared with Company performance goals  and stockholder return relative to the market. The actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 0% to 200%  of the target number of shares. (4)  Includes (i) 150,305,765 shares available for future issuance under the 2004 Plan; (ii) 74,935,925 shares available for future issuance under the 2011 ESPP;  (iii) 2,725,611 shares available for future issuances under the Legacy ESPP, a plan under which employee stock purchases are no longer made; and  (iv) 1,366,380 shares are reserved for issuance under our Service Anniversary Stock Plan, a plan under which awards are no longer granted. Taking into account  the enumerated unavailable shares from the Legacy ESPP and the Service Anniversary Stock Plan, a total of 229,333,681 shares were available for future  grants as of October 31, 2020. The HP Inc. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2021 ESPP”), which was approved by stockholders at the 2020 annual  meeting of stockholders, will be effective on May 1, 2021. 50,000,000 shares will be available for future issuance under the 2021 ESPP. The 2021 ESPP will  replace the 2011 ESPP, which will terminate on May 1, 2021. CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure In accordance with SEC rules, we are reporting our CEO pay ratio. As set forth in the Summary Compensation Table, our CEO’s annual total  compensation for fiscal 2020 was $12,479,815. Our median employee’s annual total compensation was $88,448, resulting in a CEO pay ratio of 141:1. In calculating the CEO pay ratio, the SEC rules allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, apply certain exclusions, and make reasonable  estimates and assumptions reflecting their unique employee populations. Therefore, our reported CEO pay ratio may not be comparable to CEO pay  ratios reported by other companies due to differences in industries and geographical dispersion, as well as the different estimates, assumptions,  and methodologies applied by other companies in calculating their CEO pay ratios. — We are using the same median employee for our fiscal 2020 pay ratio calculation as we used in fiscal 2019 and 2018, as there have been  no changes in employee population or compensation arrangements, such as any mergers, spinoffs, or mass layoffs, that would result in a  significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. — We calculated the median employee’s annual total compensation for fiscal 2020 using the same methodology that was used for our named  executive officers, as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. 70 www.hpannualmeeting.com Equity compensation plans not approved by HP stockholders — — — Total 34,775,994 $16.3182 229,333,681 Common shares  available for future  issuance under equity  compensation plans  (excluding securities  reflected in column (a))  (c) Equity compensation plans approved by HP stockholders 34,775,994(3) $16.3182 229,333,681(4) The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2020 (or as of the date otherwise indicated below) concerning beneficial ownership by:   — holders of more than 5% of HP’s outstanding shares of common stock;   — our Directors and nominees;   — each of the named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 59; and   — all of our Directors and executive officers as a group.

The proponent has requested we include the proposal and supporting statement in this proxy  statement, and, if properly presented, the proposal will be voted on at the annual meeting. This proposal and supporting statement are quoted verbatim below and HP is not responsible for any inaccuracies contained in them. The HP Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal and its opposition statement can be found below the proposal. Shareholders request that our board of directors take such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by the shareholders entitled to  cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize an action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon  were present and voting. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any appropriate topic for written consent. This proposal topic won 88%-support at an AT&T annual meeting. We gave 51% support to this proposal topic in 2018. Plus we gave 49%  support to this proposal topic in 2020. The 2020 vote was in effect a 51% vote because management put its hand on the scale in regard to the  2020 proposal. Management spent shareholder money to do extra advertisements against the 2020 proposal. Plus management also made it  less difficult for shareholders to call a special shareholder meeting in an attempt to pacify shareholders. And this was before the shareholder right  to call a special in-person shareholder meeting was eliminated by the 2020 pandemic. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) said it adopted written consent in 2019 after 45%-support for a written consent shareholder  proposal. This was clearly less than our 51% vote. And this BK action was a year before the pandemic made in-person shareholder meetings a  dinosaur - perhaps forever. It is so much easier for management to conduct an online shareholder meeting that management is now spoiled and  will never want to return to an in-person shareholder meeting. Shareholders need to be able to accomplish more outside of a shareholder meeting due to the onslaught of tightly controlled online shareholder  meetings. With the near universal use of online annual shareholder meetings, which can last only 10-minutes, shareholders are severely restricted in  making their views known because all challenging questions and comments can be screened out. For instance Goodyear management hit the mute button right in the middle of a formal shareholder proposal presentation at its 2020  shareholder meeting. Goodyear management simply did not want shareholders to hear constructive criticism. Plus AT&T management would not allow any sponsors of shareholder proposals to speak at the 2020 AT&T online annual meeting during the pandemic. Please see: AT&T investors denied a dial-in as annual meeting goes online https://whbl.com/2020/04/17/att-investors-denied-a-dial-in-as-annual-meeting- goes-online/1007928/ Online meetings also give management a blank check to make false statements. For instance management at scores of 2020 online annual  meetings falsely stated that there were no more shareholder questions. Online shareholders were powerless to point out that their questions  were not answered. Stockholder Proposal Please see: Schwartz-Ziv, Miriam, How Shifting from In-Person to Virtual Shareholder Meetings Affects Shareholders' ’Voice (August 16, 2020). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=3674998 or http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3674998 Now more than ever shareholders need to have the option to take action outside of a shareholder meeting since tightly controlled online  shareholder meetings are a shareholder engagement wasteland. — HP’s strong stockholder engagement practices year-round, including recently and specifically with respect to a proposal to permit  stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting of stockholders; and   — the Board’s belief that the proposal would circumvent the protections, procedural safeguards and advantages provided to all stockholders by  stockholder meetings. HP continually evaluates stockholder feedback and developments in corporate governance and implements appropriate changes to its corporate  governance policies and practices that it believes are in the best interests of HP and its stockholders. Our stockholders were given an opportunity to consider a nearly identical proposal at our 2020 Annual Meeting. At that meeting, an advisory  proposal to provide stockholders with the ability to act by written consent without a meeting of stockholders failed to receive support from a  majority of the shares present and entitled to vote on the proposal. Specifically, of the share present and entitled to vote, 49.7% supported the  proposal, while 50.3% voted against the proposal or abstained from voting (which has the same effect as a vote against). As a percentage of  outstanding shares, 37.5% supported the proposal. Following the receipt of this proposal, the Board revisited its review and analysis from last year. Specifically, the Board considered whether  there have been any material changes to the factors that the Board considered last year with respect to the potential adoption of a written  consent right. After thorough consideration, the Board determined that adopting a written consent right is not in the best interests of HP or our  stockholders at this time for the following reasons: — the fact that action by written consent can create substantial confusion and disruption, as different stockholder groups may solicit multiple  written consents simultaneously, some of which may be duplicative or contradictory; and   — our current stockholder base and the relatively consistent presence of at least one stockholder that has owned or controlled the vote of more  than 10% of our outstanding shares over the past few years, which makes the 15% threshold to call a special meeting realistic to achieve. The Board also took note of the closeness of the vote on a written consent proposal at the 2018 Annual Meeting, where, of the shares present  and entitled to vote, 50.4% (or 37.5% of our outstanding shares) supported the proposal. In response to the vote at the 2018 Annual Meeting,  the Board conducted further engagement with our stockholders to better understand the vote results and incorporate stockholder feedback into  the Board’s ultimate response to that vote. Based on the feedback received from stockholders during such engagement, the Board determined it  would be consistent with the wishes of the broadest group of our stockholders and responsive to the vote on the written consent proposal at the  2018 Annual Meeting to further facilitate the ability of stockholders to act in between annual meetings. Specifically, in lieu of adopting a written 74 www.hpannualmeeting.com consent right, effective as of February 7, 2019, the Board amended our Bylaws to lower the threshold share ownership required to call a special  meeting from 25% to 15% of our outstanding shares. We believe that stockholder support of the Board’s response to the vote on the written  consent proposal at the 2018 Annual Meeting is evidenced by our stockholders rejecting a nearly identical proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting. For all of the above reasons, the Board continues to believe that the risk of abuse associated with stockholder action by written consent, including  bypassing procedural protections that offer transparency and advance notice, both of which are afforded with a stockholder meeting, as well  as HP’s commitment to good corporate governance, HP’s strong stockholder engagement program and HP stockholders’ existing right to call a  special meeting with a 15% threshold, make this proposal not in the best interest of all of our stockholders. Board Recommendation The Board believes that adoption of this proposal is unnecessary and not in HP’s or our stockholders’ best interests for the reasons described  above. Accordingly, the Board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal. Vote Required Approval of this stockholder proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of HP common stock present in person or  represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal at the annual meeting.

The proxy materials include:   — our proxy statement for the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders; and   — our 2020 Annual Report, which includes our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. If you received a paper copy of these materials by mail, the proxy materials also include a proxy card or a voting instruction card for the annual  meeting. If you received a notice of the Internet availability of the proxy materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials, see Questions 16  and 17 below for information regarding how you can vote your shares. Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of the proxy materials instead of a paper copy of the full set of  proxy materials? This year, we are using the SEC rule that allows companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing to many  of our stockholders a notice of the Internet availability of the proxy materials instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials. All stockholders  receiving the notice will have the ability to access the proxy materials over the Internet and request to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials  by mail, should they so desire. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found in  the notice of the Internet availability of the proxy materials. In addition, the notice contains instructions on how you may request access to proxy  materials in printed form by mail or electronically on an ongoing basis. Why didn’t I receive a notice in the mail about the Internet availability of the proxy materials? We are providing some of our stockholders, including stockholders who have previously requested to receive paper copies of the proxy materials  and some of our stockholders who are living outside of the United States, with paper copies of the proxy materials instead of a notice of the  Internet availability of the proxy materials. In addition, we are providing proxy materials or notice of the Internet availability of the proxy materials by e-mail to those stockholders who have  previously elected delivery of the proxy materials or notice electronically. Those stockholders should receive an e-mail containing a link to the  website where those materials are available and a link to the proxy voting website. How can I access the proxy materials over the Internet? Your notice of the Internet availability of the proxy materials, proxy card, or voting instruction card will contain instructions on how to:   — view our proxy materials for the annual meeting on the Internet; and   — instruct us to send our future proxy materials to you electronically by e-mail. Our proxy materials are available at www.proxyvote.com/HP. Please have your 16-digit control number available to access them. Our proxy materials are also publicly available on our dedicated annual meeting website at www.hpannualmeeting.com. 76 www.hpannualmeeting.com If you request a separate set of the proxy materials or notice of Internet availability of the proxy materials by e-mail, please be sure to include  your control number in the subject line.

If you choose to access future proxy materials electronically,  you will receive an e-mail with instructions containing a link to the website where those materials are available and a link to the proxy voting  website.

I share an address with another stockholder, and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials or notice of the Internet  availability of the proxy materials. How may I obtain an additional copy? If you share an address with another stockholder, you may receive only one paper copy of the proxy materials or notice of the Internet availability  of the proxy materials, as applicable, unless you have provided contrary instructions. If you wish to receive a separate set of the proxy materials or  notice of the Internet availability of the proxy materials now, please request the additional copy by contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

You may receive more than one notice, more than one e-mail, or more than one paper copy of the proxy materials, including multiple paper copies of  this proxy statement and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you  may receive a separate notice, a separate e-mail, or a separate voting instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are  a stockholder of record and your shares are registered in more than one name, you may receive more than one notice, more than one e-mail or more  than one proxy card. To vote all of your shares by proxy, you must either vote by Internet or by telephone, or complete, sign, date, and return each proxy  card and voting instruction card that you receive and/or vote over the Internet the shares represented by each notice and e-mail that you receive (unless  you have requested and received a proxy card or voting instruction card for the shares represented by one or more of those notices or e-mails). How may I obtain a copy of HP’s 2020 Form 10-K and other financial information? We also will furnish any exhibit to the 2020 Form 10-K if specifically requested. Voting Information 11. What proposals will be voted on at the meeting? How does the Board recommend that I vote and what is the voting requirement for each  of the proposals? 78 www.hpannualmeeting.com We also will consider any other business that properly comes before the annual meeting. See Question 28 below. 12.  What are broker non-votes? A broker non-vote occurs with respect to a proposal when a broker, trustee, or other nominee has discretionary authority to vote on one or more  proposals to be voted on at a meeting of stockholders but is not permitted to vote on other proposals without instructions from the beneficial  owner and the beneficial owner fails to provide the nominee with such instructions. Under the rules of the NYSE, brokers, trustees, or other  nominees may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. Only Proposal No. 2 (ratifying the appointment of  the independent registered public accounting firm) is considered a routine matter. The other proposals are not considered routine matters, and  without your instructions, your broker cannot vote your shares. In tabulating the voting results for any particular proposal, shares that constitute  broker non-votes are not considered entitled to vote on that proposal. https://investor.hp.com/resources/information-request/default.aspx www.hpannualmeeting.com https://investor.hp.com To participate in the annual meeting, you will need the 16-digit control number included on your notice of Internet availability of the proxy  materials, on your proxy card or on the instructions that accompanied your proxy materials. If you have any questions about your control number,  please contact the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares. Shares held in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted electronically during the annual meeting. Shares for which you are the beneficial  owner but not the stockholder of record may also be voted electronically during the annual meeting, except that shares held in the HP 401(k) Plan  cannot be voted electronically during the annual meeting. If you hold shares in the HP 401(k) Plan, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59  p.m., Eastern Time, on April 8, 2021 for the trustee to vote your shares. However, holders of shares in the HP 401(k) Plan will still be able to view the  annual meeting webcast and ask questions during the annual meeting. Even if you plan to participate in the annual meeting online, we recommend  that you also vote by proxy as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to participate in the annual meeting. 17.  How can I vote my shares without participating in the annual meeting? Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or through a broker, trustee, or other nominee as the beneficial owner, you may  direct how your shares are voted without participating in the annual meeting. There are three ways to vote by proxy: — VIA THE INTERNET: Stockholders who have received a notice of the Internet availability of the proxy materials by mail may submit proxies over the  Internet by following the instructions on the notice. Stockholders who have received notice of the Internet availability of the proxy materials by e-mail  may submit proxies over the Internet by following the instructions included in the e-mail. Stockholders who have received a paper copy of a proxy card  or voting instruction card by mail may submit proxies over the Internet by following the instructions on the proxy card or voting instruction card.  If you provide specific instructions with regard to certain items, your shares will be voted as you instruct on such items. If you vote by proxy card  and sign the proxy card without giving specific instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board (FOR  all of our nominees to the Board, FOR ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, FOR the approval of  the compensation of our named executive officers (“say on pay” vote), and AGAINST the stockholder proposal regarding written consent). For any shares you hold in the HP 401(k) Plan, if your voting instructions are not received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 8, 2021, your shares  will be voted in proportion to the way the shares held by the other HP 401(k) Plan participants are voted, except as may be otherwise required by law. 13.  Is cumulative voting permitted for the election of Directors? No, you may not cumulate your votes in the election of Directors. At the 2016 Annual Meeting, our stockholders approved an amendment to the  Certificate of Incorporation eliminating cumulative voting. Therefore, cumulative voting is no longer available to our stockholders. 14.  What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? Most of our stockholders hold their shares through a broker, trustee, or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized  below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. — Stockholder of Record—If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered, with respect to those  shares, the “stockholder of record.” As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to HP or to a third  party, or to vote your shares during the annual meeting. — Beneficial Owner—If your shares are held in a brokerage account, by a trustee, or by another nominee (that is, in “street name”), you are  considered the “beneficial owner” of those shares. As the beneficial owner of those shares, you have the right to direct your broker, trustee,  or nominee how to vote, or to vote your shares during the annual meeting (other than shares held in the HP 401(k) Plan, which must be  voted prior to the annual meeting). 15.  Who is entitled to vote and how many shares can I vote? Each holder of shares of HP common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on February 16, 2021, the record date for the  annual meeting, is entitled to cast one vote per share on all items being voted upon at the annual meeting. You may vote all shares owned by  you as of this time, including (1) shares held directly in your name as the stockholder of record, including shares purchased through our dividend  reinvestment program and employee stock purchase plans, and shares held through our Direct Registration Service; and (2) shares held for you  as the beneficial owner through a broker, trustee, or other nominee. On the record date, HP had approximately 1,246,598,418 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 16.  How can I vote my shares during the annual meeting? This year’s annual meeting will be held entirely online to allow greater participation. Stockholders may participate in the annual meeting by  visiting either of the following websites: www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/HPQ2021 www.hpannualmeeting.com or A dividend reinvestment and stock purchase program is also available through our transfer agent. For information about this program, please  contact our EQ Shareowner Services transfer agent as follows: — VIA TELEPHONE: Stockholders of record who live in the United States or Canada may submit proxies by telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903  and following the instructions. Stockholders of record who have received a notice of the Internet availability of the proxy materials by mail  must have the control number that appears on their notice available when voting. Stockholders of record who received notice of the Internet  availability of the proxy materials by e-mail must have the control number included in the e-mail available when voting. Stockholders of record  who have received a proxy card by mail must have the control number that appears on their proxy card available when voting. Most stockholders  who are beneficial owners of their shares living in the United States or Canada and who have received a voting instruction card by mail may vote  by phone by calling the number specified on the voting instruction card provided by their broker, trustee, or nominee. Those stockholders should  check the voting instruction card for telephone voting availability. — VIA MAIL: Stockholders who have received a paper copy of a proxy card or voting instruction card by mail may submit proxies by completing,  signing and dating their proxy card or voting instruction card and mailing it in the accompanying pre-addressed envelope. 18.  What is the deadline for voting my shares? If you hold shares as the stockholder of record, your vote by proxy must be received before the polls close during the annual meeting. If you hold shares in the HP 401(k) Plan, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 8, 2021 for the trustee  to vote your shares. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker, trustee, or other nominee (including any shares held as a  result of your participation in HP’s 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”)), please follow the voting instructions provided by your  broker, trustee or nominee. The deadline to provide voting instructions for shares you hold as a beneficial owner may be earlier than the deadline  provided above. 19.  May I change my vote or revoke my proxy? You may change your vote or revoke your proxy at any time prior to the vote during the annual meeting, except that any change to your voting  instructions for shares held in the HP 401(k) Plan must be provided by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 8, 2021 as described above. If you are the stockholder of record, you may change your vote by: (1) granting a new proxy bearing a later date (which automatically revokes  the earlier proxy); (2) providing a written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary at the address below in Question 32 prior to your shares  being voted; or (3) participating in the meeting and voting your shares electronically during the annual meeting. Participation in the annual  meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically make that request. For shares you hold beneficially  in the name of a broker, trustee, or other nominee, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, trustee, or  nominee, or by participating in the meeting and electronically voting your shares during the meeting (except that shares held in the HP 401(k)  Plan cannot be voted electronically at the annual meeting). 20.  Is my vote confidential? Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy.  Your vote will not be disclosed, either within HP or to third parties, except: (1) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements; (2) to allow for  the tabulation of votes and certification of the votes; and (3) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. Occasionally, stockholders provide on their  proxy card written comments, which are then forwarded to management. 21.  What if I have questions for our transfer agent?

The quorum requirement for holding the annual meeting and transacting business is that holders of a majority of shares of HP common stock  entitled to vote must be present in person or represented by proxy. Both abstentions and broker non-votes described previously in Question 12  above are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. What if a quorum is not present at the annual meeting? If a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the annual meeting, then either the chairman of the annual meeting or the stockholders by  vote of the holders of a majority of the stock present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting are authorized by our Bylaws to  adjourn the annual meeting until a quorum is present or represented. What happens if additional matters are presented at the annual meeting? Other than the four items of business described in this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the annual  meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, Enrique Lores and Harvey Anderson, will have the discretion to vote your  shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting. In the event that any nominee should become unavailable, the  proxy holders, Enrique Lores and Harvey Anderson, will vote for a substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board, unless the Board  decides to decrease the size of the Board. If any substitute nominees are so designated, we will file an amended proxy statement or additional soliciting material that, as applicable, identifies the substitute nominees, discloses that such nominees have consented to being named in  the amended proxy statement or additional soliciting material and to serve as directors if elected, and includes certain biographical and other  information about such nominees required by the applicable SEC rules. Who will serve as inspector of elections? The inspector of elections will be a representative from an independent firm, Broadridge. 30. Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting? We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with  the SEC within four business days of the annual meeting. Who will bear the cost for the solicitation of proxies by HP? HP is making this solicitation and will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing, and distributing the notices and these proxy  materials and soliciting votes. In addition to the mailing of the notices and these proxy materials, the solicitation of proxies or votes may be made  in person, by telephone, or by electronic communication by certain of our Directors, officers, and employees, who will not receive any additional  compensation for such solicitation activities. We have hired Innisfree M&A Incorporated (“Innisfree”) to assist us in the solicitation of votes described above. We will pay Innisfree a base fee of  $20,000 plus customary costs and expenses for these services. We have agreed to indemnify Innisfree against certain liabilities arising out of or  in connection with these services. We also will reimburse brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for forwarding proxy  and solicitation materials to stockholders. What is the deadline to propose actions (other than Director nominations) for consideration at next year’s annual meeting  of stockholders? You may submit proposals for consideration at future stockholder meetings. For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our  proxy statement for the annual meeting next year, the Corporate Secretary must receive the written proposal at our principal executive offices  no later than October 25, 2021. Such proposals also must comply with SEC regulations under Rule 14a-8 regarding the inclusion of stockholder  proposals in Company-sponsored proxy materials. Proposals should be addressed to our Corporate Secretary at HP Inc., 1501 Page Mill Road,  Palo Alto, California 94304. — not earlier than the close of business on December 14, 2021; and   — not later than the close of business on January 13, 2022. — 90 days prior to the meeting; and   — 10 days after public announcement of the meeting date. Deadlines for the nomination of Director candidates are discussed in Question 34 below. 33. How may I recommend individuals to serve as Directors and what is the deadline for a Director recommendation? You may recommend Director candidates for consideration by the NGSR Committee. Any such recommendations should include verification of the  stockholder status of the person submitting the recommendation and the nominee’s name and qualifications for Board membership and should  be directed to the Corporate Secretary at the address of our principal executive offices set forth in Question 32 above. See “—Identifying and  Evaluating Candidates for Directors” above for more information regarding our Board membership criteria. A stockholder may send a recommended Director candidate’s name and information to the Board at any time. Generally, such proposed  candidates are considered at the first or second Board meeting prior to the issuance of the proxy statement for our annual meeting. 82 www.hpannualmeeting.com How may I nominate individuals to serve as Directors and what are the deadlines for a Director nomination? Our Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate Directors for consideration at an annual meeting. To nominate a Director for consideration at an  annual meeting, a nominating stockholder must provide the information required by our Bylaws and give timely notice of the nomination to  the Corporate Secretary in accordance with our Bylaws, and each nominee must meet the qualifications required by our Bylaws. To nominate  a Director for consideration at next year’s annual meeting (but not for inclusion in our annual proxy statement), in general the notice must be  received by the Corporate Secretary between the close of business on December 14, 2021 and the close of business on January 13, 2022, unless  the annual meeting is moved by more than 30 days before or 60 days after the anniversary of the prior year’s annual meeting, in which case the  deadline will be as described in Question 32 above. In addition, our Bylaws provide that under certain circumstances, a stockholder or group of stockholders may include Director candidates that  they have nominated in our annual meeting proxy statement. These proxy access provisions of our Bylaws provide, among other things, that a  stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders seeking to include Director candidates in our annual meeting proxy statement must own 3% or  more of HP’s outstanding common stock continuously for at least the previous three years. The number of stockholder-nominated candidates  appearing in any annual meeting proxy statement cannot exceed 20% of the number of Directors in office as of the last day on which a request to  include a stockholder-nominated candidate may be delivered in accordance with our Bylaws. If 20% is not a whole number, the maximum number  of stockholder-nominated candidates would be the closest whole number below 20%. Nominees submitted under the proxy access procedures  that are later withdrawn or are included in the proxy materials as Board-nominated candidates will be counted in determining whether the  20% maximum has been reached. If the number of stockholder-nominated candidates exceeds 20%, each nominating stockholder or group of  stockholders may select one nominee for inclusion in our proxy materials until the maximum number is reached. The order of selection would be  determined by the amount (largest to smallest) of shares of HP common stock held by each nominating stockholder or group of stockholders.  The nominating stockholder or group of stockholders also must deliver the information required by our Bylaws, and each nominee must meet  the qualifications required by our Bylaws. Requests to include stockholder-nominated candidates in our proxy materials for next year’s annual  meeting must be received by the Corporate Secretary: — not earlier than the close of business on November 14, 2021; and   — not later than the close of business on December 14, 2021. 35. How may I obtain a copy of the provisions of our Bylaws regarding stockholder proposals and Director nominations? You may contact the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices for a copy of the relevant Bylaws provisions regarding the  requirements for making stockholder proposals and nominating Director candidates. Our Bylaws are also available on our investor relations  website at https://investor.hp.com. Who can help answer my questions?

Business. We are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies,  solutions and services. We sell to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) and large enterprises, including customers  in the government, health and education sectors. As part of the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“Hewlett Packard Enterprise”), Hewlett-Packard Company’s former enterprise  technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses (the “Separation”) on November 1, 2015, HP and Hewlett Packard  Enterprise entered into a separation and distribution agreement, an employee matters agreement and various other agreements which remain  enforceable that provide a framework for the continuing relationships between the parties. We have three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments. The Personal Systems segment offers commercial  and consumer desktop and notebook personal computers (“PCs”), workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices, retail point-of- sale (“POS”) systems, displays and other related accessories, software, support and services. The Printing segment provides consumer and  commercial printer hardware, supplies, services and solutions, as well as scanning devices. Corporate Investments includes HP Labs and certain  business incubation and investment projects. Personal Systems offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook PCs, workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices, retail  POS systems, displays and other related accessories, software, support and services. We group commercial notebooks, commercial desktops,  commercial services, commercial mobility devices, commercial detachables and convertibles, workstations, retail POS systems and thin clients  into commercial PCs and consumer notebooks, consumer desktops, consumer services and consumer detachables into consumer PCs when  describing performance in these markets. Both commercial and consumer PCs maintain a multi-operating system, multi-architecture strategies  using Microsoft Windows, Google Chrome, Android operating systems and use predominantly processors from Intel Corporation (“Intel”) and  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (“AMD”). Commercial PCs are optimized for use by enterprise, public sector which includes education, and SMB customers, with a focus on robust designs,  security, serviceability, connectivity, reliability and manageability in networked and cloud-based environments. Commercial PCs include the HP  ProBook and HP EliteBook lines of notebooks, convertibles, and detachables, the HP Pro and HP Elite lines of business desktops and all-in-ones,  retail POS systems, HP Thin Clients, HP Pro Tablet PCs and the HP notebook, desktop and Chromebook systems. Commercial PCs also include  workstations that are designed and optimized for high-performance and demanding application environments including Z desktop workstations,  Z all-in-ones and Z mobile workstations. Additionally, we offer a range of services and solutions to enterprise, public sector and SMB customers to  help them manage the lifecycle of their PC and mobility installed base. Consumer PCs are optimized for consumer usage, focusing on gaming, learning and working remotely, consuming multi-media for entertainment,  managing personal life activities, staying connected, sharing information, getting things done for work including creating content, staying  informed and secure. These systems include HP Spectre, HP Envy, HP Pavilion, HP Chromebook, HP Stream, Omen by HP lines of notebooks and  hybrids and HP Envy, HP Pavilion desktops and all-in-one lines, and Omen by HP desktops. Personal Systems groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance:   — Notebooks consists of consumer notebooks, commercial notebooks, mobile workstations and commercial mobility devices;   — Desktops includes consumer desktops, commercial desktops, thin clients, and retail POS systems;   — Workstations consists of desktop workstations and accessories; and   — Other consists of consumer and commercial services as well as other Personal Systems capabilities. Printing provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, supplies, services and solutions. Printing is also focused on Graphics and 3D  imaging solutions in the commercial and industrial markets. HP goes to market through its extensive channel network and directly with HP sales.  Our global business capabilities within Printing are described below: Office Printing Solutions delivers HP’s office printers, supplies, services, and solutions to SMBs and large enterprises. It also includes Original  Equipment Manufacturer (“OEM”) hardware and solutions, and some Samsung-branded supplies. Home Printing Solutions delivers innovative printing products, supplies, services and solutions for the home, home business and micro business  customers utilizing both HP’s Ink and Laser technologies. It also includes some Samsung-branded supplies. Graphics Solutions delivers large-format, commercial and industrial solutions and supplies to print service providers and packaging converters  through a wide portfolio of printers and presses (HP DesignJet, HP Latex, HP Indigo and HP PageWide Web Presses). 3D Printing and Digital Manufacturing offers a portfolio of additive manufacturing solutions and supplies to help customers succeed in their  additive and digital manufacturing journey. HP offers complete solutions in collaboration with an ecosystem of partners. — Supplies comprises a set of highly innovative consumable products, ranging from ink and laser cartridges to media, graphics supplies and 3D  printing and digital manufacturing supplies, for recurring use in consumer and commercial hardware. Corporate Investments includes HP Labs and certain business incubation and investment projects. We manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above. Our customers are organized by  consumer and commercial groups, and purchases of HP products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by HP or indirectly through a  variety of partners, utilizing their own physical or internet stores or an omnichannel combination of the two, including: — system integrators and other business intermediaries that provide various levels of services, including systems integration work and as-a- service solutions, and typically partner with us on client solutions that require our products and services. The mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel sales differs by business and geographic market. We believe that customer buying  patterns and different geographic market conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts to the geographic market  and sub-geographic specificities for each of our businesses. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our market coverage while  identifying efficiencies and productivity gains in both our direct and indirect routes to market. Our businesses collaborate to accomplish strategic  and process alignment where appropriate. For example, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business  with large enterprise customers. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise and drives both  direct and indirect sales to their assigned customers. For other customers and for consumers, we typically manage both direct online sales as well  as channel relationships with retailers mainly targeting consumers and small businesses and commercial resellers mainly targeting SMBs and  mid-market accounts. We utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers (“OMs”) around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. The use of OMs is  intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for HP-designed products. We use multiple OMs to maintain flexibility in our  supply chain and manufacturing processes. In some circumstances, third-party suppliers produce products that we purchase and resell under the  HP brand. Additionally, we manufacture finished products from components and sub-assemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors. 4 HP Inc. We utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products  to order to maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring  products to order enables units to match a customer’s hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management and  distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking  delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers. We purchase materials, supplies and product sub-assemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have  existing alternate sources of supply or alternate sources of supply are readily available. However, we have relied on sole sources for some laser  printer engines, LaserJet supplies, certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles (although some of these sources have  operations in multiple locations, mitigating the effect of a disruption). For instance, we source the majority of our A4 and a portion of A3 portfolio  laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from Canon. Any decision by either party not to renew our agreement with Canon or to limit or  reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect our net revenue from LaserJet products; however, we have a long-standing business  relationship with Canon and anticipate renewal of this agreement. We are dependent upon Intel and AMD as suppliers of x86 processors and Microsoft for various software products. We believe that disruptions  with these suppliers would have industry-wide ramifications, and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our  competitors. See “Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers  effectively” in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Like other participants in the information technology (“IT”) industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of  blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we may  experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from multiple sources. We also may  acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the  priority, price and availability of supplies. See “Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to  manage our suppliers effectively” in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Sustainability also plays an important role in the manufacturing and sourcing of materials and components for our products. We strive to make  our products in an ethical and sustainable manner. We have committed to building an efficient, resilient and sustainable supplier network, and  we collaborate with our suppliers to improve their labor practices and working conditions, and to reduce the environmental impact of their  operations. These actions, together with our broader sustainability program, help us in our effort to meet customer sustainability requirements  and comply with regulations, for example, regarding supplier labor practices and conflict minerals disclosures. For more information on our  sustainability goals, programs, and performance, we refer you to our annual sustainability report, available on our website (which is not  incorporated by reference herein). Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet both consumer and enterprise  customers’ demand on a worldwide basis and draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce. This provides stability to  our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for  maturing products. In addition, we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target  developing countries. In this regard, we believe that our broad geographic presence as well as our focus on diversity and inclusion, gives us a solid  base on which to build future growth. Innovation across products, services, business models and processes is a key element of our culture. Our development efforts are focused on  designing and developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers’ changing needs and desires, and emerging technological  trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering  with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers’ experiences. HP Labs, together with the various research and development groups within our business segments, is responsible for our research and  development efforts. HP Labs is part of our Corporate Investments segment. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and  development of innovative, high-quality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive position. For a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see “Risk Factors—If we cannot successfully execute our strategy  and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services, our business and financial performance may suffer” in  Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Patents Our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining  such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At October 31, 2020, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 28,000 patents. Patents generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms  of the individual patents across our patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the  competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we  choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is essential to HP as a whole or to  any of HP’s business segments. In addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property (“IP”) from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also  granted and continue to grant to others licenses, and other rights, under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest.  These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties. For a discussion of risks attendant to IP rights, see “Risk Factors—Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license  or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend”, “Risk Factors—Our products and services depend in part on IP and  technology licensed from third parties” and “Risk Factors—Third-party claims of IP infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit  or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services” in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our products  and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our  products and services. For example, European sales are often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the  fourth calendar quarter. Demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of  seasonal trends. See “Risk Factors—Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less  predictable,” in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete on the basis of technology, innovation, performance,  price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships,  customer training, service and support, security, availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings, and our  sustainability performance. The markets for each of our key business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established  positions and a large number of new and rapidly growing firms. Most product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop  new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively on the basis of the factors listed  above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and often market  their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future  success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive. We have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing-related products and  services. We are the leader or among the leaders in each of our key business segments. Personal Systems. The markets in which Personal Systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and  introduction of new products and solutions. Our primary competitors are Lenovo Group Limited, Dell Inc., Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Acer  Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Apple Inc., Toshiba Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. In particular geographies,  we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or “white box” manufacturers. Our competitive advantages  include our broad product portfolio, our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features, our innovative design  work, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross-sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and support offerings and the  accessibility of our products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales. Printing. The markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive. Printing’s key customer segments each face  competitive market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products. Our primary competitors include Canon Inc., Lexmark International,  Inc., Xerox Corporation Ltd., Seiko Epson Corporation, The Ricoh Company Ltd. and Brother Industries, Ltd. In addition, independent suppliers 6 HP Inc. offer non-original supplies (including imitation, refill and remanufactured alternatives), which are often available for lower prices but which can  also offer lower print quality and reliability compared to HP original inkjet and toner supplies. These and other competing products are often sold  alongside our products through online or omnichannel resellers or distributors, or such resellers and distributors may highlight the availability  of lower cost non-original supplies. Our competitive advantages include our comprehensive high-quality solutions for the home, office and  publishing environments, our innovation and research and development capabilities including security features, sustainability, our brand, and the  accessibility of our products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales. For a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors, see “Risk Factors—We operate in an intensely competitive industry and  competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance,” in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Sustainability At HP, we believe in the power of technology to enable people and communities to change the world for the better. Sustainable impact is  fundamental to our reinvention journey, fueling our innovation and growth, strengthening our business for the long term and enabling us to  develop and deliver the best solutions to our customers. Our approach covers a broad range of sustainability issues across three pillars: Planet, People and Community. We prioritize issues based on their  relative importance to our culture, business success and sustainable development. Planet. We aim to grow our business, not our footprint, and support our customers to do the same by transforming our entire business to drive  a more efficient, circular, and low-carbon economy and by enabling our customers to invent the future through our most sustainable portfolio of  products and services. People. We champion dignity, respect and empowerment for all people with whom we work, and strive to respect human rights and embed  diversity and inclusion in everything we do. We are committed to doing our part to enable all people who help bring our products to market to  thrive at work, at home and in their communities. Community. Through our technology, time and resources, we work to catalyze positive change in communities where we live, work and do  business. As a result, we aim to unlock educational and economic opportunity through the power of technology and improve the vitality and  resilience of our local communities. Goals. Our current long-term sustainability goals are: — Use 30% post-consumer recycled content plastic (“RCP”) across our personal systems and print portfolio by 2025 (which refers to RCP as a  percentage of total plastic used in all HP personal systems, printer hardware, and print cartridges shipped during the reporting year);   — Eliminate 75% of single-use plastic packaging by 2025, compared to 2018. (Calculated as the percentage of primary plastic packaging (by  weight) reduced per unit shipped). — Consistent with a science-based reduction target in line with 1.5℃, reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions in our  global operations by 60% by 2025, compared to 2015; — Help suppliers cut 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions between 2010 and 2025;   — Recycle 1.2 million tonnes of hardware and supplies by 2025, since the beginning of 2016; and   — Reduce potable water consumption across global operations by 35% by 2025, compared to 2015 with a focus on high risk sites; — Double our number of Black and African American executives by 2025.   — Develop skills and improve well-being of 500,000 factory workers by 2025, since the beginning of 2015;   — Double factory participation in our supply chain sustainability programs by 2025, compared to 2015; and   — Maintain greater than 99% completion rate of annual Integrity@HP training among active HP employees and the Board of Directors. — Enable better learning outcomes for 100 million people by 2025, since the beginning of 2015;   — Enroll 1 million HP LIFE (Learning Initiative for Entrepreneurs) users between 2016 and 2025;   — Contribute $100 million in HP Foundation and employee community giving cumulatively by 2025 since the beginning of 2016; and   — Contribute 1.5 million employee volunteering hours cumulatively by 2025, since the beginning of 2016. For more information on our sustainability goals, programs, and performance, we refer you to our annual Sustainable Impact Report, available on  our website (which is not incorporated by reference herein). Environment Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws  addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the  cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party  damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. Many of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use,  including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in  electronics products. Most of our products also are subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption. In addition, we face increasing  complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials  composition of our products, and their safe use. We proactively evaluate and at times replace materials in our products and supply chain, taking into account, among other things, published lists  of substances of concern, new and upcoming legal requirements, customer preferences and scientific analysis that indicates a potential impact to  human health or the environment. We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and  printers, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes  referred to as “product take-back legislation”). We are also subject to standards set by public and private entities related to sustainability issues  such as energy consumption, reusing or recycling. We intend for our products to be easily reused and recycled, and we provide many of our  customers with reuse and recycling programs. In the event our products become non-compliant with these laws or standards, our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions  or from being procured by certain governments or private companies, and we could face other sanctions, including fines. Our operations, supply chain and our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations  and international treaties relating to climate change, such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements. As these and other new  laws, regulations, treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply  or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. We strive to continually improve the energy and carbon efficiency  of our operations, supply chain and product portfolio and deliver more cost-effective and less greenhouse gas-intensive technology solutions to  our customers. We believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements,  and we are collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that HP technology can be used to address  climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws, regulations and treaties. We are committed to complying with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our  environmental impact across all aspects of our business. This commitment is reflected and outlined in our sustainability policy, our  comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental  programs and services. 8 HP Inc. A liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred  and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows  or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not  have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures  for environmental control facilities. For a discussion of risks attendant to these environmental factors, see “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to various federal, state, local  and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations” in  Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, for a discussion of our environmental contingencies see Note 14, “Litigation and  Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is also incorporated herein by reference. HP’s approximately 53,000 employees worldwide power our innovation, contributing unique perspectives and a growth mindset to create  breakthrough technologies and transformative solutions. We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace that attracts and  retains exceptional talent. Through ongoing employee development, comprehensive compensation and benefits, and a focus on health, safety  and employee wellbeing, we strive to help our employees in all aspects of their lives so they can do their best work, every single day. Innovation at HP comes from the diverse perspectives, knowledge, and experiences of our employees. We strive to create an inclusive workplace  where people can bring their authentic selves to work. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse board. We are among the top technology companies  for women in executive positions. Women represent 29.6% of HP’s full-time executive positions and 32.3% of full-time director-level employees.  We are committed to increasing representation of women at HP overall, but particularly in leadership and technical roles globally. This focus also extends to underrepresented minorities in the United States. HP is committed to doubling the number of Black and African  American executives by 2025. Women represent 36.9% of HP’s worldwide employees and racial and ethnic minorities represent 28.9% of HP’s U.S. employees as of  October 31, 2020. In 2020, 62.0% of our U.S. hires were from underrepresented groups, including women, U.S. Ethnicities, veterans and people  with disabilities. To ensure leadership maintains a strong focus on diversity and inclusion, each executive leader has individual performance goals under  the Management by Objectives (“MBOs”) program tied to diversity and inclusion. The board also has ongoing oversight of diversity and  inclusion programs. For additional information regarding our diversity and inclusion programs, please see the section titled “Our Approach to Human Capital  Management” in HP’s 2021 Proxy Statement. We believe people should be paid for what they do and how they do it, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. To deliver  on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience,  the location of their job, and their performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices, both in terms of our overall workforce and  individual employees, to ensure our pay is fair and equitable. For the past five years and with the support of independent third-party experts in this field, HP has reviewed the compensation of employees to  ensure consistent pay practices by conducting a pay equity analysis annually comparing employees in the same role within a country/location. HP expanded its annual pay equity assessment in 2020 - evaluating eight countries with our largest employee populations, representing 65%  of our global workforce. The independent analysis found no systemic issues and any outliers were addressed as part of the normal off-cycle  compensation review process. We regularly collect feedback to better understand and improve the employee experience and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our  culture. In 2020, 96% of employees participated in our annual employee survey. Last year we achieved highest level of employee engagement  (top quartile). Employees’ highest rated areas were the following: diversity and inclusion (95%) and ethics and integrity (95%). Human capital development underpins our efforts to execute our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products  and services. We continually invest in our employees’ career growth and provide employees with a wide range of development opportunities,  including face-to-face, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and external development. In 2020, 98% of employees  participated in learning and development activities. The physical health, financial wellbeing, life balance and mental health of our employees is vital to HP’s success. Our environmental, health, and safety leadership team uses our global injury and illness reporting system to assess trends regionally and  worldwide as a part of quarterly reviews. Our manufacturing facilities continue to represent our most significant health and safety risks, due to  higher potential exposure to chemicals and machinery related hazards. Managing and reducing risks at these facilities remains a focus, and injury  rates continue to be low. We also sponsor a global wellness program designed to enhance physical, financial, and mental wellbeing for all our employees around the  world.

The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important for understanding any  statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8,  “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our results of operations, past financial performance may not be a reliable  indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Strategic and Operational Risks Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by the  COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic have resulted in, and are  expected to continue to result in, a substantial curtailment of business activities (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods  and services), weakened economic conditions, supply chain disruptions, significant economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets,  both in the United States and abroad. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely impacting, and is expected to continue to adversely impact, our operations and financial performance.  COVID-19 related restrictions impacted the demand for certain products and services as a result of temporary closures of offices and businesses  and as people moved to spending more time at home, which negatively impacted sales for commercial products in both Personal Systems  and Print. For as long as remote working and learning practices remain prevalent, whether due to restrictions implemented by governmental  authorities or businesses allowing employees to continue to work remotely, we expect decreased sales of products for in-office consumption  in some markets and channels. While this decrease in demand has been partially offset by increased sales of certain products for in-home  consumption, we are unable to predict for how long or to what extent this increase will continue. Moreover, our channel partners have  experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations due to restrictions implemented in response to COVID-19, which  has caused, and may continue to cause, reduced, or cancelled orders and/or collection risks. This has further adversely impacted our results of  operations and we expect it to continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations. 12 HP Inc. HP Inc.  Attention: Investor Relations  1501 Page Mill Road,  Palo Alto, CA 94304  http://investor.hp.com/resources/information-request/default.aspx Additionally, we have experienced temporary factory closures and other supply chain disruptions as a result of COVID-19, and we may continue  to experience such disruptions. For example, our manufacturing sites, including in China and Southeast Asia, as well as those of our suppliers  and outsourcing partners, were adversely impacted by COVID-19 as a result of quarantines, facility closures, and travel and logistics restrictions.  As of the end of fiscal year 2020, our factories have returned to largely normalized levels. These disruptions in Asia resulted in temporary  supply shortages that affected sales worldwide for both Personal Systems and Print, as well as incremental costs. We may experience further  disruptions in the future, and any prolonged disruptions to our manufacturing operations, supply chain and/or distribution channels could have a  material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to have significant sources of cash and liquidity and access to committed credit lines, but a prolonged period of generating lower  cash from operations could adversely affect our financial condition. We are also facing increased operational challenges as we take measures to support and protect employee health and safety, including limiting  employee travel, closing facilities and offices, and implementing work-from-home policies for employees. In particular, our remote work  arrangements, coupled with stay-at-home orders and quarantines, pose challenges for our employees and our IT systems and extended periods  of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including cybersecurity and IT systems  management risks, and impair our ability to manage our business. The effects of COVID-19 may also limit the resources afforded to or delay the implementation of our strategic initiatives and make it more  difficult to develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services. If our strategic initiatives are delayed or otherwise modified, such  initiatives may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business,  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including:  governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; general economic  uncertainty in global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery  when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Further, COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could precipitate or aggravate the  other risk factors that we identify in this report, any of which could materially adversely impact our business. We also face an increased risk of  litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on economic and market conditions. Further, COVID-19  may also affect our business and financial results in ways that are not presently known to us or that we do not currently consider as significant  risks to our operations. If we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our  ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited. Our business faces many challenges we must address. One set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating market trends, which may  include declines in the markets in which we operate. For example, a competitive pricing environment and weakened market in certain geographies  with associated customer pricing sensitivity has presented market challenges in Printing. A second set of challenges relates to changes in the  competitive landscape. Our primary competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets;  our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models; and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly  becoming our competitors in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution. For example,  we may fail to develop innovative products and services, maintain the manufacturing quality of our products, manage our global, multi-tier  distribution network, limit potential misuse of pricing programs by our channel partners, exclude imitation print supplies from our printers with  technological protection measures, adapt to new or changing marketplaces or successfully market new products and services, any of which could  adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, we currently face, and may face in the future, an unpredictable macroeconomic  environment, which may exacerbate these challenges. If we do not succeed in our efforts to mitigate these challenges, or if these efforts are  more costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to  invest in and grow our business. We operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business and financial performance. We encounter aggressive competition from competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have targeted and are expected to  continue targeting our key market segments. We compete on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability,  brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security,  availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings, and our sustainability performance. If our products, services, support and  cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully, our results of operations, cash flows and business prospects could be harmed. We have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing  with companies that have smaller portfolios or specialize in one or more of our product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of  our business than our competitors, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to their products  and services compared to the resources allocated to our competing products and services. Our alliance partners in certain areas may be or may become our competitors in others. In addition, these partners also may acquire or form  alliances with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships  with alliance partners, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive,  while at the same time trying to maintain or improve our revenue and gross margin. In addition, competitors who have a greater presence in  some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, and/or  more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to  offer. Our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets  in which we operate. Additionally, our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential  customers or suppliers. Because our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount of  our revenues on research and development than some of our competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from  research and development expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and profitability could be  adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is a negative reception to  our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects. Even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, the financial performance of that product could decline because the  product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains technology that is becoming obsolete. Financial performance could also decline due  to increased competition from other types of products. For example, non-original supplies (including imitation, refill or remanufactured alternatives)  for some of our LaserJet toner and InkJet cartridges compete with our Printing Supplies business. Customers are increasingly using online and omnichannel resellers and distributors to purchase our products. These resellers and distributors  often sell our products alongside competing products, including non-original print supplies, or they may highlight the availability of lower cost  non-original supplies. We expect this competition will continue, and it may negatively impact our financial performance, particularly if large  commercial customers purchase competing products instead of HP products. If we cannot successfully execute our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services, our  business and financial performance may suffer. Our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services to meet the demands of a changing technological landscape  and to offset certain areas of industry decline. To successfully execute this strategy, we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where  demand remains strong, identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth, innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to  expand beyond our existing technology categories and adapt to new and changing marketplaces for our products. For example, our go-to-market  strategy, including online, omnichannel and contractual sales, needs to evolve with market dynamics, forces and demand. In fiscal year 2020,  we created a single commercial organization led by a newly-created chief commercial officer role. If we cannot innovate, develop and execute  evolutionary strategies in this changing environment (including our end to end business model in Print), then we may not be able to successfully  compete and maintain the value proposition of our products, including supplies. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any  failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  Moreover, the process of developing new high-technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly  and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly  harm our market share, cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. To execute our strategy, we must optimize our cost structure, make long-term investments, develop or acquire and appropriately protect intellectual  property, and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer  demand for our products and services. Any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends, control research and development costs or  execute our strategy could harm our business and financial performance. Our research and development initiatives or other investments may not be  successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding and/or personnel, and our  customers may not adopt our new business models. 14 HP Inc. Our industry is subject to rapid and substantial innovation and technological change. Even if we successfully develop new products and  technologies, future products and technologies may eventually supplant ours if we are unable to keep pace with technological advances and  end-user requirements and preferences and timely enhance our existing products and technologies or develop new ones. Our competitors may  also create products that replace ours. As a result, any of our products and technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical. After we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving or improving  margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements,  and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product’s lifecycle or at all. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new  product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position. Moreover,  new products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses may  not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically or that we had expected. If we cannot continue to produce high-quality and secure products and services, our reputation, business and financial performance  may suffer. In the course of conducting our business, we must address quality and security issues associated with our products and services, including defects  in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, and unsatisfactory performance or  malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees. Our business is also exposed to the risk of defects in third-party  components included in our products, including security vulnerabilities. In order to address quality and security issues, we work extensively with  our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement effective solutions.  However, the products and services that we offer are complex, and our regular testing and quality control efforts may not be completely effective  in controlling or detecting all quality and security issues or errors, particularly with respect to defects or security vulnerabilities in components  manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause or find an effective solution to address quality or security issues with our products, we may delay  shipment to customers, which would delay revenue recognition and receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our net revenue,  cash flows and profitability. We have and may again in the future write off some or all of the value of defective inventory. In addition, after  products are delivered, quality and security issues may require us to repair or replace such products. Addressing these issues can be expensive  and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. In the event of security  vulnerabilities or other issues with third-party components, we may have to rely on third parties to provide mitigation such as firmware updates.  Furthermore, these mitigation techniques may be ineffective or may result in adverse performance, system instability and data loss or corruption.  If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services, our results of operations and cash flows  could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers’ expectations. In addition, quality and security  issues, including those resulting from defects or security vulnerabilities in third-party components, can impair our relationships with new or  existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and  financial condition. The net revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable. Our net revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our portfolio of products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and  therefore will likely be different in future periods than our current results. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are  dependent on the product, service, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period’s net revenue, which in turn depends on the overall  demand for our products and services. For example, a combination of a higher consumer mix within both Personal Systems and Print hardware  and lower rate in commercial print negatively impacted gross margin in fiscal 2020. Delays or reductions in spending by our customers or  potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline  in net revenue. In addition, net revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect net revenue in our other businesses as we may lose  cross-selling opportunities. Competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs that we are unable to pass  on to our customers, increased tariffs, component supply disruptions and other risks affecting our businesses may also have a significant impact  on our overall gross margin and profitability. In addition, newer geographic markets can be relatively less profitable due to our investments  associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we can have difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating  infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, competitive  pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, increased tariffs, regulatory impacts and other factors may  result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. For example, our  supplies business has recently experienced declining revenues due to declines in market share, installed base and usage, and increased customer  pricing sensitivity. Our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because  the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period. We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our suppliers effectively. Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as our suppliers’ ability to deliver sufficient  quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet schedules for the delivery of our products and  services. Given the wide variety of products and services we offer, the large and diverse distribution of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and  the long lead times required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in production, planning and  inventory management and regulatory compliance that could seriously harm our business. Third-party suppliers may have limited financial resources  to withstand challenging business conditions, particularly as a result of increased interest rates or emerging market volatility, and our business could be  negatively impacted if key suppliers are forced to cease or limit their operations. Due to the international nature of our third-party supplier network, our  financial results may also be negatively impacted by increased trade barriers and increased tariffs, which could increase the cost of certain components,  products and services that we may not be able to offset. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause  supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers may decide to  discontinue business with us. Other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the terms of our  contracts with suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers, risks related to supply chain working conditions, human rights and materials sourcing  and risks related to our relationships with single-source suppliers, each of which is described below. — Component shortages. We may experience a shortage of, or a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity  constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, the inability of suppliers to borrow funds, disputes with suppliers (some of whom are also our  customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the  transition to new suppliers. For example, we experienced disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain during the COVID-19 pandemic,  which resulted in temporary supply shortages that negatively affected our ability to fulfill demand for Personal Systems and Printing  products worldwide. Additionally, our Personal Systems business relies heavily upon OMs to manufacture its products and is therefore  dependent upon the continuing operations of those OMs to fulfill demand for our products. We represent a substantial portion of the  business of some of these OMs, and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular OM could adversely  affect the operations and financial condition of the OM and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that OM. If shortages or  delays persist, the price of certain components may increase, we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available  at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services  in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, our business, cash flows, results of operations  and financial condition could suffer if we lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to  our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to re-engineer some product or service offerings, which could  result in further costs and delays.   — Excess supply. In order to secure components for our products or services, we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into  non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance of demand to take  advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about future availability. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a  temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.   — Contractual terms. As a result of binding long-term price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase  components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing  market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a  disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur  additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. In addition, many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same  OMs and suppliers that we utilize. Our competitors may obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, and more  favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in relationships with certain OMs  and suppliers could be limited. The practice employed by our Personal Systems business of purchasing product components and transferring  those components to OMs may create large supplier receivables with the OMs that, depending on the financial condition of the OMs, may create  collectability risks. In addition, our OMs and suppliers may decide to discontinue business with us. Any of these developments could adversely  affect our future cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.   — Contingent workers. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to effectively manage our use of such  workers could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past  and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers. Our  ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws. 16 HP Inc. — Working conditions, human rights and materials sourcing. We work with our suppliers to improve their labor practices, working conditions,  and respect for human rights, such as by including requirements in our agreements with our suppliers that workers receive fair treatment,  safe working conditions and freely chosen employment, that materials are responsibly sourced and that business operations are conducted  in a socially and environmentally responsible and ethical way. Brand perception, customer loyalty and legal compliance could be adversely  impacted by a supplier’s improper practices or failure to comply with the above-mentioned requirements or those included in our Supplier  Code of Conduct, General Specification for the Environment and other related provisions and requirements of our procurement contracts,  including supplier audits, reporting of smelters, human rights due diligence, wood fiber certification (for HP brand paper and product  packaging) and GHG emissions, water and waste data. — Single-source suppliers. We obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or  other considerations. For example, we rely on Canon for certain laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges. We also rely on both Intel  and AMD to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for the majority of our PCs and workstations. Some of those processors may  be customized for our products. New products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially  until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers. Replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of  some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations. For some components, such  as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from Intel, or the laser printer engines and toner cartridges that we  obtain from Canon, alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary  to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term  agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited  notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single-source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension  of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our components. The loss of a single-source supplier,  the deterioration of our relationship with a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are  supplied components by a single-source supplier could adversely affect our business and financial performance. If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and financial performance could suffer. We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including third-party resellers and distributors and  both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct sales and indirect channel  sales efforts to reach potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method  has distinct risks and gross margins, any failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services  could adversely affect our net revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability and cash flows. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel  partners were to weaken. Our results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution  channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or reduced assortments of our products. Moreover, some of  our distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic  weakness, industry consolidation and market trends. They may also have difficulty selling our products under new business models. Many of  our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures in the past. Considerable trade  receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners. Net revenue  from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors’ financial conditions, abilities to borrow  funds or operations weaken or if our distributors cannot successfully compete in the online or omnichannel marketplace. Our inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. We must manage both owned and  channel inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Our forecasts  may not accurately predict demand, and distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high  or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of  our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods, including a multi-tiered channel, may  reduce our visibility into inventories, demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting and managing multi-tiered channel inventory  more difficult. Further, if we were to expand direct distribution initiatives, distributors could consider such initiatives to conflict with their business interests  and reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of our products, or to cease all sales of our products. Sales of our products by channel partners  to unauthorized resellers or unauthorized resale of our products could also make our forecasting and channel inventory management more difficult and  impact pricing in the market. For example, in the past we have had channel partners sell products outside of their agreed territory, and misrepresent sales  to unauthorized resellers as sales to end-users, frustrating our efforts to estimate channel inventory and maintain consistent pricing, and negatively  impacting gross margins. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of  indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. In  addition, factors in different markets may cause differential discounting between the geographies where our products are sold, which makes it difficult to  achieve global consistency in pricing and creates the opportunity for grey marketing. In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. To the extent they fail to do so, that  could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable. Our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter’s total sales occurs towards the end of the quarter.  This uneven sales pattern makes predicting net revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases  the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If  predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may  not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be canceled by the customer. Depending on when they occur in a quarter,  developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions could adversely impact our  inventory levels, our results of operations and cash flows in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition.  For example, sales to governments (particularly sales to the U.S. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, and many customers  whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget  constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year. Consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter due in part to seasonal  holiday demand. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely  impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. Moreover, to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand  trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches. Typically, our  fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest by revenues. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control. Any failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could  harm our financial results, business and prospects. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint  ventures and make investments to further our business. Risks associated with these transactions include the following, any of which could  adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, cash flows and financial condition: — Managing these transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. — We may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of any particular transaction, and the timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular  transaction may depend upon the actions of employees, advisors, suppliers, other third-parties, competition or market trends. — Certain transactions have resulted, and in the future may result, in significant costs and expenses, including those related to severance  pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities  and contracts, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required  payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans. — Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failures to meet contractual obligations could make these transactions less  profitable than anticipated or unprofitable. — Our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company’s product quality, financial disclosures, accounting  practices or internal controls, including as a result of being dependent on the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures  made or actions taken by third parties.   — The pricing and other terms of our contracts for these transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into  these contracts, and we may not identify all factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs, timing and other matters or we may incur  costs if a transaction is not consummated. — In order to complete a transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for our existing stockholders. — We may borrow to finance these transactions, and the amount and terms of any such debt, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity  and financial condition. — These transactions could adversely impact our effective tax rate. — Any announced transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all, which may cause our financial results to differ from  expectations in a given quarter. — These transactions may lead to litigation. — If we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend  resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. If there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units, we  may incur additional charges, which may include impairment charges. 18 HP Inc. As part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our  objectives. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in  a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are  less desirable than we had anticipated. In addition, we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected, and the impact of the divestiture on  our revenue growth may be larger than projected. After reaching an agreement for the acquisition or disposition of a business, we are subject to  satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which, if not satisfied or  obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Such regulatory and governmental approvals may be required in jurisdictions around  the world, including jurisdictions with opaque regulatory frameworks, and any delays in the timing of such approvals could materially delay the  transaction or prevent it from closing. Integrating acquisitions may be difficult and time-consuming. Any failure by us to integrate acquired companies, products or services  into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results, business and prospects. To pursue our strategy successfully, we have to identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment  transactions, some of which may be large or complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses, products,  services or employees. Integrations involve significant challenges and are often time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and  implementation, could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business. These challenges include successfully combining product and  service offerings; entering or expanding into markets; retaining key employees; integrating employees, facilities, technology, products, processes,  operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; and  retaining customers and distributors of the businesses. We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our restructuring may adversely affect our business. We have undertaken and may undertake in the future restructuring plans in order to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business  and to achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs, including the plans announced in October 2016 (as amended in May 2018), and  the plan announced in October 2019. We began implementing the 2020 restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and expect to complete  the restructuring by the end of fiscal 2022. Implementation of any restructuring plan may be costly and disruptive to our business, and we may not be  able to obtain the estimated workforce reductions within the projected timing or at all, or the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated. We  currently plan to invest some of the savings from our 2020 restructuring plan across our businesses, including investing to build our digital capabilities,  and if we are unable to obtain the anticipated cost savings, our ability to make those investments and execute our strategy may be negatively impacted.  Additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency, adverse  effects on employee morale, loss of key employees and/or other retention issues during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can  require a significant amount of time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all  of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of  operations and cash flows. For more information about our 2020 restructuring plan, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our  businesses depend. We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property (“IP”) laws in the United States, similar laws in other  countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain IP rights in the products and  services we sell, provide or otherwise use in our operations. However, our IP rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented,  or such IP rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages,  either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive  position. For example, our enforcement of our IP rights of our InkJet printer supplies against infringers may be successfully challenged or our IP  rights may be successfully circumvented. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws  of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized  third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive position. In connection with the Separation, Hewlett-Packard Company allocated to each of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP the IP assets relevant to their  respective businesses. The terms of the Separation also include cross-licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of IP in the existing  operations of both businesses. As a result of the allocation of IP as part of the Separation, we no longer own IP allocated to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and  our resulting IP ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent and trademark enforcement, patent licensing and  cross-licensing, our ability to sell our products or services, our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets. Our products and services depend in part on IP and technology licensed from third parties. Some of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties. We may not be able to obtain or continue  to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to our IP.  Third-party components may become obsolete, defective or incompatible with future versions of our products, or our relationship with the third party  may deteriorate, or our agreements may expire or be terminated. We may face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the  disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must monitor and manage our use of  third-party components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our IP without  compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that  allow our product offerings to remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business,  including our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may  obtain licenses to some of our IP rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the  availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the terms we request, there is a risk that  third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license to us or refuse to license to us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our  competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these IP rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements  in order to terminate or limit these rights. Finally, we may rely on third-parties to enforce certain IP rights. For instance, we rely on Canon to enforce IP rights  associated with certain LaserJet products. Failure by Canon to do so could impair our ability to protect our market share for those products. Third-party claims of IP infringement are commonplace in our industry and may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services. Third parties have in the past claimed, and may in the future claim, that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their IP rights. For  example, patent assertion entities may purchase IP assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements.  These assertions have increased over time, particularly in the United States. If we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed IP at all or on reasonable  terms, or if we are required to substitute technology from another source, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that IP claims  are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our  business. Claims of IP infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlements or license agreements, pay damage  awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain products. Even if we have an agreement  to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to fulfill its contractual obligations to us. Additionally, claims of IP  infringement may adversely impact our brand and reputation and imperil new and existing customer relationships. Our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected by the imposition, accrual and payment of copyright levies  or similar fees. In certain countries (primarily in Europe), proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded in which groups representing copyright  owners seek to impose upon and collect from us levies upon IT equipment (such as PCs, multifunction devices and printers) alleged to be copying  devices under applicable laws. Other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can  be collected from us. Other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes, and  countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies. The total amount of the copyright levies will depend  on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy, the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy,  and the per unit fee for each type of product, all of which are affected by several factors, including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving  us and other industry participants and possible action by legislative bodies, and could be substantial. Consequently, the ultimate impact of these  copyright levies or similar fees, and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain. System security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks, system outages and systems integration issues could disrupt our  internal operations or services provided to customers, and could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation  and adversely affect our cash flows and stock price. We are exposed to attacks from individuals and organizations, including malicious computer programmers and hackers, state-sponsored organizations  or nation-states, seeking to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties,  create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Such attacks may also involve the deployment of viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious  software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products, or attempt to fraudulently induce our  employees, customers, or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to our systems or data. In addition,  sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or  manufacture, including “bugs” that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the product. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security  could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of  their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive  position, result in theft or misuse of our IP or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect  our business. Additionally, the costs to us to combat cyber or other security problems can be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may 20 HP Inc. not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales,  manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in our network security, even if nothing  has been attempted or occurred, could adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business. While we have developed and  implemented security measures and internal controls designed to protect against cyber and other security problems, such measures cannot provide  absolute security and may not be successful in preventing future security breaches. Moreover, these threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing  the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. In some instances, we may have no current  capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. In the past, we have experienced  data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to or use of our systems or those of third parties, which to date have not had a material impact  on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. We manage and store proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers. Breaches of our security  measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data  about us, our clients or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of deception, can expose  us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm  our business, and result in government enforcement actions and litigation and potential liability for us. For example, the European Union’s General  Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes a data protection compliance regime with severe penalties of up to the greater of 4% of worldwide  annual turnover and/or €20 million. Additionally, in the United States, California has adopted, and several states are considering adopting, laws  and regulations imposing varying obligations regarding the handling of personal data. We also could lose existing or potential customers or incur  significant expenses in connection with our customers’ system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services.  In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Portions of our IT infrastructure, including portions provided by third parties, may experience interruptions, outages, delays or cessations of  service or may produce errors in connection with systems integrations, migration work or other causes. Any such events could result in business  disruptions and the process of remediating them could be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and resource intensive than planned. Such  disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales,  lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and  adversely affect our cash flows and stock price. Our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services businesses properly. The risks that accompany our services businesses differ from those of our other businesses. For example, the success of our services business  depends to a significant degree on attracting clients to our services, retaining these clients and maintaining or increasing the level of revenues  from these clients. Our standard services agreements are generally renewable at a customer’s option and/or subject to cancellation rights, with  or without penalties for early termination. We may not be able to retain or renew services contracts with our clients, or our clients may reduce the  scope of the services they contract for. Factors that may influence contract termination, non-renewal or reduction include business downturns,  dissatisfaction with our services or products attached to services we provide, our retirement or lack of support for our services, our clients  selecting alternative technologies to replace us, the cost of our services as compared to the cost of services offered by our competitors, general  market conditions or other reasons. We may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from lost clients or reductions in services. While  our services agreements may include penalties for early termination, these penalties may not fully cover our investments in these businesses  in the event a client terminates a services agreement early or reduces the scope of the agreement. Our clients could also delay or terminate  implementations or use of our services or choose not to invest in additional services from us in the future. In addition, the pricing and other  terms of some of our services agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could  differ from actual results. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements,  including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse  effect on the product margin of our services business. As a result, we may not generate the revenues we may have anticipated from our services  businesses within the timelines anticipated, if at all. In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could  seriously harm us. In order to be successful, we must attract, hire, retain, train, motivate, develop, and deploy qualified executives and other key employees,  including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing and IT support positions. Identifying, developing internally or hiring  externally, training and retaining qualified executives, engineers and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition  for experienced employees in the IT industry can be intense. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees, we must provide  competitive compensation, including cash- and equity-based compensation. Our equity-based incentive awards may contain conditions relating  to our stock price performance and our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of equity-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable  benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue  granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and  key employees could be weakened. Our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive  workplace culture that enables our employees to thrive. Additionally, changes in immigration policies may impair our ability to recruit and hire  technical and professional talent. Our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of executives and key employees could  have a significant impact on our operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to  successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others. Recently, HP was the target of a proxy contest and exchange offer by Xerox Holdings Corporation in connection with its unsolicited offer to acquire  HP. While Xerox ultimately terminated its offer and withdrew the slate of director candidates it had nominated, if similar actions were taken in the  future or we were the target of other activist shareholders in the future, our business could be adversely affected because responding to such  actions can be costly and time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. Moreover,  such actions may create perceived uncertainties among current and potential customers, clients, suppliers, employees and other constituencies  as to our future direction, which could result in lost sales and the loss of business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain  qualified personnel and business partners. In addition, actual or perceived actions of activist stockholders may cause significant fluctuations in  our stock price that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could  impair a takeover attempt. We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging  an acquisition of HP judged as undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions: authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we  could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification  to, our directors and officers; specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and  otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings; requiring advance notice of proposals by  our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors; and  controlling the procedures for conduct of our Board of Directors and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of our directors. These provisions could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or our management. As a Delaware corporation,  we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some  stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of  HP could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some  investors are willing to pay for our stock. Global, regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Our business and financial performance depend on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in the  markets in which we compete. Ongoing economic weakness and uncertainty in markets throughout the world have resulted, and may result in the  future, in decreased net revenue, gross margin, earnings, growth rates or cash flows and in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory  levels. Ongoing U.S. federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from organizations that  receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, which could further reduce  demand for our products and services. Political developments impacting international trade, including continued uncertainty surrounding Brexit, trade  disputes and increased tariffs, particularly between the United States and China, may negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic  conditions or drive political or national sentiment, weakening demand for our products and services. Economic weakness and uncertainty and political or nationalist sentiment impacting global trade, including the willingness of non-U.S. consumers  to purchase goods or services from U.S. corporations, may adversely affect demand for our products and services, may result in increased  expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges, and may make it more difficult  for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses. 22 HP Inc. We also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such  as competitive pricing pressures and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by  our manufacturers and suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers. In addition, our business may be disrupted if we are unable to  obtain equipment, parts or components from our suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or  the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit, or if any of our distributors lack sufficient financial resources to withstand economic weakness. Continued economic weakness and uncertainty could also cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any financial turmoil  affecting the banking system and financial markets or any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury  operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice. Poor financial performance of asset markets  combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher pension and post- retirement benefit expenses. Interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates,  borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. There is uncertainty regarding  the discontinuation, modification or reform of LIBOR and the implementation of alternative reference rates could result in an increase in our  interest expense. Economic downturns also may lead to future restructuring actions and associated expenses. Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes, uncertainty or other factors could harm our business  and financial performance. Approximately 64% of our net revenue for fiscal year 2020 came from outside the United States. In addition, a portion of our business activity is being  conducted in emerging markets. Our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including: — trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, shipping, pricing and marketing of products, including policies adopted by  the United States or other countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors;   — political or nationalist sentiment impacting global trade, including the willingness of non-U.S. consumers to purchase goods or services from  U.S. corporations;   — local labor conditions and regulations, including labor issues faced by specific suppliers and Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), or  changes to immigration and labor law which may adversely impact our access to technical and professional talent; — fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping  infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments. The factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States.  For example, we rely on manufacturers in Taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in Asia for product assembly  and manufacture. Beginning in 2018, the United States commenced certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and  other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader  range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products and  the components that go into making them. Tariffs or other trade restrictions could adversely impact our overall gross margin and profitability.  Tariffs or other trade-related actions could also disrupt our manufacturing and supply chain, or those of our key suppliers. For example, we rely  on manufacturers and suppliers in Asia for the production of notebook computers. In many countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and  regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended. Although we implement policies, procedures and  training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those of the companies to which we  outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies,  could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our results. Currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and the Japanese yen, can have an impact on  our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Global economic events, including trade disputes, economic sanctions and emerging market volatility, and  associated uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate, which may contribute to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted  jurisdictions. For example, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly known as “Brexit”) has caused significant  volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the British pound, and continued uncertainty regarding the withdrawal  may continue to cause exchange rate volatility. In addition, if one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency,  our sales into such countries, or into Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. Because a  majority of our revenues are generated outside the United States, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our net  revenue growth in future periods. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the  United States and products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States. From time to time, we may use forward contracts and/or options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange  rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during  periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We may incur significant losses from our hedging  activities due to factors such as demand volatility. In addition, our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a  portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue,  financial condition and, to a lesser extent, our cost of sales. Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, natural disasters, fires,  extreme weather conditions (whether as a result of climate change or otherwise), medical epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) and other  natural or man-made disasters or catastrophic events, for which we are predominantly self-insured. Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars, for which  we are predominantly uninsured, may also disrupt our worldwide operations. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in  significant losses, seriously harm our revenue, profitability, cash flows and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position, increase  our costs and expenses, require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations, make it difficult or impossible  to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our  supply chain and/or result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. In addition, global climate change may result in certain natural  disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding. Our corporate  headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in California, and other critical business operations and  some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. The manufacture of product  components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations. We also rely on  major logistics hubs primarily in Asia to manufacture and distribute our products, and primarily in the southwestern United States to import  products into North and South America. Our operations and those of our significant suppliers and distributors could be adversely affected if  manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, such as those described above or other economic,  business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers, our distributors  and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions and  being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain. Even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly, if our  customers cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, they may reduce or cancel their orders, or these events could  otherwise result in a decrease in demand for our products, which may adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies. Past downgrades of Hewlett-Packard Company’s ratings increased the  cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and reduced market capacity for our commercial paper. Future downgrades could have the same  effect, and could also require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. We cannot be assured that we will be  able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any  announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative  impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets. 24 HP Inc. Our level of indebtedness and related debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and financial condition. As of October 31, 2020, we had an aggregate of $6.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal  year 2041 and we had availability under our revolving credit facility of $4.0 billion, availability under our 364-day revolving credit facility of $1.0  billion, and $725 million available from uncommitted lines of credit. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our debt level  and related debt service obligations could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and  economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend repayments, acquisitions, and other general  corporate purposes. Moreover, our indebtedness increases our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. Further, we may  be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, debt refinancing, future acquisitions  or other general corporate purposes. Our ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, our financial  position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control, and could be adversely impacted by  our debt level. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, which could adversely  impact our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness or to repay our outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due and adversely impact our  business and financial condition. Additionally, further borrowings may increase the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings, which could  increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing. We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, and any changes to  those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations. In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical  experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this report. For example, we make significant estimates and assumptions  when accounting for revenue recognition, taxes on earnings and restructuring and other charges. In addition, as discussed in Note 14 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other  contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant  uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions  that adversely affect our business and results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that such laws and regulations will not be changed  in ways that will require us to modify our business models and objectives or affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products,  subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. For example, we are subject to environmental laws, regulations and standards, including  laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of  contaminated sites, the content of our products and the recycling, reuse, treatment and disposal of our products, including print supplies and batteries. In  particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the  chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws and  regulations, and product repairability, reuse and take-back legislation. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products  become non-compliant with environmental laws, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions, which may include restrictions on our products  entering certain jurisdictions. Our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage, personal injury claims and  clean-up costs. Further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively, on a joint and several basis, and  without any finding of noncompliance or fault. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict. Moreover, we are  expected to become increasingly subject to laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as carbon pricing or product energy  efficiency requirements. As these new laws, regulations, treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented, we will be required to  comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. We are subject to risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings. We face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder, consumer, competition, commercial, IP, employment, and other issues on a global  basis. There is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment, including but not limited to employment and patent-monetization claims  in the United States and litigation and regulatory matters focused on consumer protection, privacy, and competition regulation globally. As described  in Note 14, “Litigation and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory  matters that may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations, if decided adversely to  or settled by us. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings have occurred and may occur, including awards  of monetary damages, imposition of fines, issuance of injunctions or cease-and-desist orders directing us to cease engaging in certain business  practices, cease manufacturing or selling certain products, requiring the compulsory licensing of patents, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable  outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. In addition, regardless of  the outcome, litigation and regulatory proceedings can be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations, and distracting to management. Failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and  financial performance. Our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with federal, state,  provincial and local governmental customers are subject to procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their  formation, administration and performance. Any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation  of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts,  forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future government  contracting. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, Hewlett-Packard Company has in the past been,  and we may in the future be, subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government  contracts, which could include claims for treble damages. Further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings  surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. Additionally, some  of our agreements with governmental customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely  impact public sector demand for our products and services. If our customer contracts are terminated, if we are suspended or disbarred from  government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer. Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect  our financial performance. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge  in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax  authorities may disagree with these intercompany transactions or other matters and may assess additional taxes or adjust taxable income on our tax  returns as a result. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we  may not accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from  the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. Our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries  with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or  enforcement. In addition, tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax  rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. Any of these changes could affect our financial performance. We or Hewlett Packard Enterprise may fail to perform under the transaction agreements executed as part of the Separation. In connection with the Separation, we and Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into several agreements, including among others a separation  and distribution agreement and an employee matters agreement. The separation and distribution agreement and employee matters agreement  determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the Separation for those respective areas and include any  necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. Hewlett Packard Enterprise has spun off or separated certain of its businesses  since the Separation, and some of its obligations under these and other agreements have transferred to the successor entities. We will rely on  Hewlett Packard Enterprise or its successor entities to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Hewlett  Packard Enterprise or its successor entities are unable to satisfy their obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties  or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 26 HP Inc.

The Company’s share repurchase program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private  transactions. On February 22, 2020, HP’s Board of Directors increased HP’s remaining share repurchase authorization to $15.0 billion in total. HP  intends to repurchase shares opportunistically as part of a robust share repurchase program. HP expects to continue share repurchases at an  elevated level of at least $1.0 billion per quarter in the coming quarters, unless higher return opportunities emerge. All share repurchases settled  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 were open market transactions. As of October 31, 2020, HP had approximately $12.7 billion remaining  under the share repurchase authorizations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is organized as follows:   — Overview. A discussion of our business and other highlights affecting the company to provide context for the remainder of this MD&A. — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. A discussion of accounting policies and estimates that we believe are important to understanding  the assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results.   — Results of Operations. An analysis of our financial results comparing fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year  2018. A discussion of the results of operations is followed by a more detailed discussion of the results of operations by segment. — Liquidity and Capital Resources. An analysis of changes in our cash flows and a discussion of our liquidity and financial condition. — Contractual and Other Obligations. An overview of contractual obligations, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan contributions,  cost-saving plans, uncertain tax positions and off-balance sheet arrangements. The discussion of financial condition and results of our operations that follows provides information that will assist the reader in understanding  our Consolidated Financial Statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary  factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our Consolidated Financial  Statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear  elsewhere in this document. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries We are a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies,  solutions, and services. We sell to individual consumers, SMBs and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and  education sectors. We have three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments. The Personal Systems segment  offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook PCs, workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices, retail POS systems, displays  and other related accessories, software, support, and services. The Printing segment provides consumer and commercial printer hardware,  supplies, solutions and services, as well as scanning devices. Corporate Investments include HP Labs and certain business incubation and  investment projects. — In Personal Systems, our strategic focus is on profitable growth through innovation and market segmentation. This focus is with respect to  enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes. Additionally,  we are investing in endpoint services and solutions. We are focused on services, including Device as a Service, as the market begins to  shift to contractual solutions. We are driving innovation to enable productivity and collaboration as near-term demand continues for work  from home and distance learning as the PC has become an essential tool to create, consume and collaborate. We believe that we are well  positioned due to our competitive product lineup. — In Printing, our strategic focus is on contractual solutions to serve consumers, SMBs and large enterprises through our Instant Ink Services  and Managed Print Services (“MPS”) offerings, providing digital printing solutions for graphics segments and applications including  commercial publishing, labels, packaging and textiles; as well as expanding our footprint in the 3D printing across digital manufacturing and  strategic applications. We continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations.  One set of challenges relates to dynamic market trends, such as forecasted declining home printing markets. A second set of challenges relates  to changes in the competitive landscape. Our primary competitors are exerting competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new  markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are  increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution in  an evolving distribution and reseller landscape, with increasing online and omnichannel presence. Additional challenges we face at the segment  level are set forth below. — In Personal Systems, we face challenges with industry component availability and a competitive pricing environment. — In Printing, a competitive pricing environment, including from non-original supplies (which includes imitation, refill or remanufactured  alternatives), and a weakened market in certain geographies with associated pricing sensitivity of our customers present challenges. We also  obtain many Printing components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. For instance,  we source the majority of our A4 and a portion of our A3 portfolio of laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges from Canon. Any  decision by either party to not renew our agreement with Canon or to limit or reduce the scope of the agreement could adversely affect  our net revenue from LaserJet products; however, we have a long-standing business relationship with Canon and anticipate renewal of  this agreement. Our business and financial performance also depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Accordingly, we face global macroeconomic  challenges, particularly in light of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as discussed below, tariff-driven headwinds, uncertainty in the markets,  volatility in exchange rates and evolving dynamics in the global trade environment. The full impact of these and other global macroeconomic  challenges on our business cannot be known at this time. To address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with  generating market demand and meeting the needs of our customers and partners. In addition, we continue to work on improving our operations  and adapting our business models, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes, analytics and efficiencies. We also continue to  work on optimizing our sales coverage models, aligning our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improving channel execution and inventory  management, strengthening our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, strengthening our pricing discipline, and developing and capitalizing  on market opportunities. 32 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Specifically, in October 2019, we announced cost-reduction and operational efficiency initiatives intended to simplify the way we work, move  closer to our customers and facilitate specific investment in our business. These were further updated in February 2020. These efforts included  transforming our operating model to integrate our sales force into a single commercial organization and reducing structural costs across the  Company through our restructuring plan approved in September 2019 (the “Fiscal 2020 Plan”). We expect to invest some of the savings from  these efforts across our businesses, including investing to build our digital capabilities. Over time, we expect these investments will make us more  efficient and allow us to advance our positions in Personal Systems and Printing, while also disrupting new industries where we see attractive  medium to long-term growth opportunities. However, the rate at which we are able to invest in our business and the returns that we are able to  achieve from these investments will be affected by many factors, including the efforts to address the execution, industry and macroeconomic  challenges facing our business as discussed above. As a result, we may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to these  efforts, and the anticipated benefits of these efforts may not materialize. We typically experience higher net revenues in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday  demand. Historical seasonal patterns should not be considered reliable indicators of our future net revenues or financial performance. In late 2019, COVID-19 was first identified, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a  pandemic. The rapid spread of COVID-19 prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response, including  restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. As reflected in the discussions that follow, the COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response  to the pandemic have had a variety of impacts on our results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, some of  which have been significant. This section summarizes our response to the significant impacts that we have experienced to date, and we have also  included additional details as applicable throughout other sections of this report. We continue to actively monitor the situation and review our  plans based on the requirements and recommendations of federal, state, and local authorities. — Our employees. We have been focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we  quickly pivoted the vast majority of our employees to work from home as a safety measure in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020.  These arrangements have been designed to allow for continued operation of non-production business-critical functions, including  financial reporting systems and internal controls. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we implemented a one-time work-from-home  reimbursement program for employees to improve their workspaces. For those in manufacturing and other critical functions that could not  transition to a remote model, we quickly implemented safety and hygiene training and protocols, such as physical distancing, safety gear  mandates, site visitor restrictions, alternate staffing shifts, and enhanced cleaning and sanitization practices, to protect the employees in our  labs or manufacturing and production facilities. We have also implemented contact tracing initiatives. — Our community. We are committed to taking actions to protect the communities we serve. We are also putting our resources behind efforts  to support local communities and to assist in the public health response. We have donated millions of dollars in technology and support  across Personal Systems and Printing to help students, families, and communities, including hospitals in affected areas. — The HP 3D Printing team and Digital Manufacturing team is working with its global digital manufacturing community to mobilize  3D printing teams, technology, experience and production capacity to help deliver critical parts in the effort to battle the COVID-19  pandemic. Along with our partners and customers, we have produced more than 4 million 3D printed parts for face shields, respirators,  nasal swabs, and other items for distribution to hospitals. — We have donated HP BioPrinters and associated supply cassettes, free of charge, to research laboratories in the US and Europe to help  accelerate drug and vaccine research to combat COVID-19. — In April 2020, HP Puerto Rico kicked off large-scale manufacturing of much-needed hand sanitizer and has since delivered about  55,000 liters to local hospitals, police stations, nursing homes, fire stations, medical and wellness service providers and HP’s Customer  Service facilities, as well as to select sites in the US. — We made HP Sure Click Pro security software freely available through September 2020 to help protect against cyber threats for both HP  and non-HP Windows 10 PCs as a large portion of the population is currently working from home. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries — Our customers and partners. We are committed to our customers and partners and to meeting their needs. We have taken meaningful  actions to remain close to our customers and partners, including implementing a variety of relief initiatives to help them navigate their  operational and financial challenges. We had provided a variety of financing and leasing options for end customers. We had provided  short-term market and country-specific incentives for partners. HP has implemented a more predictable, flat-rate incentive program and  relaxed compensation models, and has also expanded its virtual engagement options, including free access to cybersecurity support and  on-demand training. Partners can opt in for customized online digital learning paths designed to meet their specific priorities. We are also  introducing programs, designed to enable our customers and partners to adapt to the current work environment, such as the HP Managed  Print Cloud Services and the HP Flexworker Solutions program. — Supply chain. For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, we experienced disruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain. This included  temporary factory closures in China and Southeast Asia that impacted our own factories as well as those of our suppliers and outsourcing  partners, resulting in higher costs and temporary supply shortages. Manufacturing capacity returned largely to normalized levels by the  end of fiscal year 2020. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we managed through ongoing logistics and industrywide component  availability challenges due to strong demand. — Demand. COVID-19 has created new and different demand dynamics in the market. This is creating both challenges and opportunities across  our businesses and geographies. In Personal Systems, we saw increased demand globally as the focus moved to keeping people connected,  productive and secure and it reemphasized the essential role that the PC plays in everyday life. We also saw a mix shift in demand from  Commercial to Consumer, Desktops to Notebooks driven by strength in Chromebooks and Education. In Printing, we saw a slowdown in  Office and Graphics as offices remain closed and large events continue to be canceled. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we saw some  progress in Commercial print driven by improved performance in the SMBs sector. We expect a gradual recovery in the overall Commercial  print market although that recovery may be uneven given the varying pace of economic recovery and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases  in some countries. We also continue to see increased demand for hardware and ink supplies on the Consumer Printing side as customers  set up home office for remote working and school environment for remote learning. We expect that the strength in Consumer Printing will  gradually subside when more offices and schools reopen. — Liquidity. The extent and duration of the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain. As a result, our liquidity and working  capital needs may be impacted in future periods. We believe that our businesses are strong cash flow generators and we maintain a strong  balance sheet to meet our liquidity needs. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities, available  commercial paper authorization, new borrowings, and our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements, planned  capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and post-retirement funding requirements, authorized  share repurchases and annual dividend payments for the foreseeable future. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position is currently  uncertain and will depend on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited to: the duration and scope of the pandemic; the  effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic and prevent or limit any reoccurrence; governmental, business and individuals’  actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial  market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. See  the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about related risks and uncertainties. On March 2, 2020, Xerox Holdings Corporation (“Xerox”) commenced an unsolicited exchange offer for all outstanding shares of HP’s common  stock (the “Offer”). Xerox had also previously nominated candidates for election to HP’s Board of Directors at HP’s 2020 annual meeting of  stockholders. On March 31, 2020, Xerox announced that the Offer had been terminated and subsequently withdrew its slate of director nominees.  In order to respond to Xerox’s actions, HP incurred certain costs during the year ended October 31, 2020. For a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in  Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 34 HP Inc. — We have committed to donating millions of dollars in products and grants to support blended learning in local communities impacted by  COVID-19 around the globe as a large portion of the world’s students are currently learning from home. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries The Consolidated Financial Statements of HP are prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles  (“GAAP”), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net  revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. As of October 31, 2020, the impact of COVID-19 on our business continued  to unfold. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and may carry a higher degree of variability and  volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change in future periods. Management  bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the  results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other  sources. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of HP’s Board of  Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results  may differ from these estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant  uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it  could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1, “Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated  Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting  estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates  reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements.  Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the  Consolidated Financial Statements. We recognize revenue depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we  are expected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We evaluate customers’ ability to pay based on various factors like historical  payment experience, financial metrics and customer credit scores. We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions, there are  contracts which contain non-standard terms and conditions. Further, many of our arrangements include multiple performance obligations. As a  result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the identification of performance  obligations that are distinct, the allocation of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of transfer  of control of promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations. We evaluate each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a distinct good or services. A performance  obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on its own or together with  other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance obligation is distinct within the context of the contract. Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer.  If the transaction price includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount using either the expected value or most likely amount method.  We reduce the transaction price at the time of revenue recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, rebates,  promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. We use estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such  programs based on historical experience, expected consumer behavior and market conditions. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries When a sales arrangement contains multiple performance obligations, such as hardware and/or services, we allocate revenue to each  performance obligation in proportion to their selling price. The selling price for each performance obligation is based on its Standalone Selling  Price (“SSP”). We establish SSP using the price charged for a performance obligation when sold separately (“observable price”) and, in some  instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. When observable price is not available, we establish SSP  based on management’s judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment  pricing strategies and the product life-cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology  industry life cycles. We may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting  standalone selling price determination applying the aforementioned management judgments and estimates. This may change the pattern and  timing of revenue recognition for identical arrangements executed in future periods but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given  arrangement. In most arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation at  the inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price. Revenue is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. We  generally invoice the customer upon delivery of the goods or services and the payments are due as per contract terms. For fixed-price support  or maintenance and other service contracts that are in the nature of stand-ready obligations, payments are generally received in advance from  customers and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the contract. In instances when revenue is derived from sales of  third-party vendor products or services, we record revenue on a gross basis when we are a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when we  are acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. We consider several factors to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an  agent, most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer, have established our own pricing and have inventory and credit risks. We accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group  basis. Our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge  for a specified period. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the  quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates,  average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of  our baseline experience. Warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts, labor and onsite services, depending upon the  product. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty obligation may be required. Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. Our major assumptions relate primarily  to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. The discount  rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits  payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the  plan. The expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations. The  expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and  management’s expected returns for each asset class. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including reviewing current capital  market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term return on plan assets. In any fiscal year, significant differences  may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between the actual return and  expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to  expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit  payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or  liability exposures. For the recognition of net periodic benefit cost, the calculation of the expected long-term return on plan assets uses the fair  value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as a result of interim re-measurement. 36 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) Our major assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit  Plans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. The following table provides the impact  a change of 25 basis points in each of the weighted-average assumptions of the discount rate, expected increase in compensation levels and  expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal year 2020: As a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain  jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2029. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do  business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the United States, and our related future effective tax rate. We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions reflected in  our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or  fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and  liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need  for a valuation allowance, we consider future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions  in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will  be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding  charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that  we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation  allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the  deferred tax assets are located. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and approximately 60 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax  audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge  these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes  amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential  assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of  an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material  impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties  concerning the tax treatment of our domestic operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany  transactions, pension and related interest. For a further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings” to the Consolidated  Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its  net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in  demand, technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and  quality issues. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree  generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these  assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill and may involve engaging independent  third parties to perform an appraisal. When determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the  acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future  growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Fair value  estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded  in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, as  additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available. We review goodwill for impairment annually during our fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying  amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. A qualitative assessment is first performed to determine if the fair value of a reporting unit is more  likely than not to be less than its carrying amount. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment may include changes in  business climate, market conditions, or other events impacting the reporting unit. If we determine an impairment is more likely than not based on  our qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment of impairment is performed. Performing a quantitative goodwill impairment test includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit and involves significant  estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used  to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of  appropriate market comparables. If we determine the carrying amount exceeds fair value, goodwill is impaired and the excess is recognized as an  impairment loss. We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of intellectual property (“IP”), commercial,  securities, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when  we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment  is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. We review these matters at  least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated  information and events, pertaining to a particular case. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, we share responsibility with  Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain matters, as discussed in Note 14, “Litigation and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements  in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise has agreed to indemnify us in whole or in part with respect  to certain matters. Based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters  further discussed in Note 14, “Litigation and Contingencies”, are not a meaningful indicator of HP’s potential liability. Litigation is inherently  unpredictable. However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results  of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have  recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2020, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been  incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements. 38 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements see Note 1, “Overview and Summary of  Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. Results of Operations Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our overall net  revenue. As a result, our net revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect it will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency  exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we supplement  the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue with the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis,  which excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations calculated by translating current period revenues using monthly average  exchange rates from the comparative period and hedging activities from the prior-year period and does not adjust for any repricing or demand  impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed with and without  the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and  trends, as management does not believe that the excluded items are reflective of ongoing operating results. The constant currency measures are  provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may  calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes. In fiscal year 2020, total net revenue decreased 3.6% (decreased 2.3% on a constant currency basis) as compared to the prior-year period.  Net revenue from the United States decreased 1.8% to $20.2 billion and net revenue from outside of the United States decreased 4.6% to  $36.4 billion. The decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by decline in Desktops, Supplies, Commercial Printing Hardware and unfavorable  foreign currency impacts, partially offset by growth in Notebooks. The decline is driven by demand weakness as businesses remained closed and  office workers continued to work from home, partially offset by strong demand in Notebooks.

Net  revenue from the United States remained flat at $20.6 billion and net revenue from outside of the United States increased 0.7% to $38.2 billion.  The increase in net revenue was primarily driven by growth in Notebooks, Desktops and Workstations in Personal Systems, partially offset by  unfavorable foreign currency impacts and a decline in Printing Supplies. A detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment net revenue is included under “Segment Information” below. Our gross margin was 18.4% for fiscal year 2020 compared with 19.0% for fiscal year 2019. The decrease was primarily due to unfavorable  segment mix and lower rate in Printing hardware partially offset by higher rate in Personal Systems driven by favorable commodity costs. Our gross margin was 19.0% for fiscal year 2019 compared with 18.2% for fiscal year 2018. The increase was primarily due to higher rate in  Personal Systems driven by lower supply chain costs. A detailed discussion of the factors contributing to the changes in segment gross margins is included under “Segment Information” below. R&D expense decreased 1.4% in fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to expense management partially offset by  continuing investments in innovation and key growth initiatives. R&D expense increased 6.7% in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to continuing investments in innovation and key  growth initiatives. SG&A expense decreased 8.6% in fiscal year 2020 as compared to the prior-year period, driven by structural cost savings from the transformation  program and the benefits of temporary discretionary cost actions. SG&A expense increased 5.3% in fiscal year 2019 as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by increased investments in key growth  initiatives and go-to-market in Personal Systems and investment in digital infrastructure. Restructuring and other charges increased by $187 million in fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to charges from  the Fiscal 2020 Plan. Restructuring and other charges increased by $143 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to charges from  the Fiscal 2020 Plan and the restructuring plan approved in October 2016 (the “Fiscal 2017 Plan”), which was later amended in May 2018. Acquisition-related charges for the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 relate primarily to third-party professional and legal fees, and integration- related costs, as well as fair value adjustments of certain acquired assets such as inventory. Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets for the fiscal year ended 2020 relates primarily to intangible assets resulting from prior acquisitions. Amortization expense increased by $36 million in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior-year period, due to intangible assets resulting primarily  from the acquisition of the Apogee group. 40 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Interest and other, net expense decreased by $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2020 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to reversal of  indemnification receivables from Hewlett Packard Enterprise pertaining to various audit settlements in the prior- year period. Interest and other, net expense increased by $0.5 billion in fiscal year 2019 compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to tax  indemnifications related to the termination of the tax matters agreement (“TMA”) with Hewlett Packard Enterprise during the fourth quarter of  fiscal year 2019. Our effective tax rates were 12.0%, (24.9%) and (76.8%) in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal year 2020, our effective  tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the resolution of various audits and favorable tax rates  associated with certain earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world. In fiscal year 2019, our effective tax rate generally differs from  the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the resolution of various audits, changes in valuation allowances, and impacts of U.S.  tax reform. In fiscal year 2018, our effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 23.3% primarily due to transitional  impacts of U.S. tax reform and resolution of various audits and tax litigation. The jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that had the most  significant impact on our effective tax rate in the periods presented were Puerto Rico, Singapore, China and Malaysia. For a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 and 23.3% in fiscal year 2018,  and further explanation of our provision for income taxes, see Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8,  which is incorporated herein by reference. In fiscal year 2020, we recorded $244 million of net income tax benefit related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. This amount includes  tax benefits related to audit settlements of $124 million in various jurisdictions and $82 million related to restructuring benefits. Additionally, we  recorded benefits of $20 million related to proxy contest costs and $17 million of other net tax benefits. In fiscal year 2020, excess tax benefits  associated with stock options, restricted stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units were immaterial. In fiscal year 2019, we recorded $1.3 billion of net income tax benefit related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. This amount includes tax  benefits related to audit settlements of $1.0 billion, $75 million due to ability to utilize tax attributes, $57 million of restructuring benefits and net  valuation allowance releases of $94 million. We also recorded benefits of $78 million related to U.S. tax reform as a result of new guidance issued  by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). These benefits were partially offset by uncertain tax position charges of $51 million. In fiscal year  2019, in addition to the discrete items mentioned above, we recorded excess tax benefits of $20 million associated with stock options, restricted  stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units. In fiscal year 2018, we recorded $2.8 billion of net income tax benefit related to discrete items in the provision for taxes which include impacts  of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). As discussed in the Note 6 “Taxes on Earnings” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this  report, we had not yet completed our analysis of the full impact of the TCJA. However, as of October 31, 2018, we recorded a provisional tax  benefit of $760 million related to $5.6 billion net benefit for the decrease in our deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, partially  offset by $3.3 billion net expense for the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments over eight years, a $1.2 billion net expense for the  remeasurement of our deferred assets and liabilities to the new U.S. statutory tax rate and a $317 million net expense related to realization on  U.S. deferred taxes that are expected to be realized at a lower rate. Fiscal year 2018 also included tax benefits related to audit settlements of  $1.5 billion and valuation allowance releases of $601 million pertaining to a change in our ability to utilize certain foreign and U.S. deferred tax  assets due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. These benefits were partially offset by other net tax charges of $34 million. In fiscal year  2018, in addition to the discrete items mentioned above, we recorded excess tax benefits of $42 million associated with stock options, restricted  stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 2, “Segment Information,” to the Consolidated Financial  Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the  segments disclosed. Personal Systems net revenue increased 0.8% (increased 2.3% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal year 2020 as compared to the prior-year  period. The net revenue increase was primarily due to growth in Notebooks, partially offset by Desktops and Workstations, and unfavorable  foreign currency impacts. The net revenue increase was driven by a 4.8% increase in unit volume partially offset by 3.8% decrease in average  selling prices (“ASPs”) as compared to the prior-year period. The increase in unit volume was primarily due to growth in Notebooks resulting from  strong demand driven by work from home, distance learning and gaming, partially offset by Desktops and Workstations. The decrease in ASPs  was primarily due to mix shifts to consumer and education, and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Consumer revenue increased 12.8% as  compared to prior-year period, driven by unit growth in Notebooks, and higher ASPs. Commercial revenue decreased 4.8% as compared to the  prior-year period, primarily driven by lower ASPs and unit declines in Desktops and Workstations, partially offset by unit growth in Notebooks. Net revenue increased 12.4% in Notebooks and decreased 18.6% in Desktops and 24.0% in Workstations in fiscal year 2020 as compared to the  prior-year period. Personal Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.0 percentage points in fiscal year 2020 as compared  to the prior-year period, primarily due to in an increase in gross margin, and decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The  increase in gross margin was primarily due to favorable commodity costs partially offset by mix shifts. The decrease in operating expenses as a  percentage of revenue was primarily due to reduction in marketing spend and our ongoing structural cost savings plan. 42 HP Inc.

The net revenue increase was primarily due to growth in Notebooks, Desktops and Workstations, partially offset by unfavorable foreign  currency impacts. The net revenue increase was driven by a 2.2% increase in unit volume and 0.5% increase in average selling prices (“ASPs”) as  compared to the prior-year period. The increase in unit volume was primarily due to growth in Notebooks and Desktops. The increase in ASPs was  primarily due to positive mix shifts and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Commercial revenue increased  7.0% primarily driven by higher unit volume partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, and consumer revenue decreased by 5.5%  primarily driven by lower unit volume, respectively, in fiscal year 2019 as compared to the prior-year period. Net revenue increased 1.7% in Notebooks, 4.1% in Desktops and 6.4% in Workstations in fiscal year 2019 as compared to the prior-year period. Personal Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.2 percentage points in fiscal year 2019 as compared  to the prior-year period, primarily due to in an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. The increase in  gross margin was primarily due to lower supply chain costs and higher ASPs. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased  investments in key growth initiatives and go-to-market. (1)  Weighted Net Revenue Change Percentage Points measures the contribution of each business unit towards overall segment revenue growth. It is calculated by  dividing the change in revenue of each business unit from the prior period by total segment revenue for the prior-year period. Printing net revenue decreased 12.1% (decreased 11.2% on a constant currency basis) for fiscal year 2020 as compared to the prior-year period.  The decline in net revenue was primarily driven by a decline in Supplies, Commercial Hardware and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Net  revenue for Supplies decreased 10.3% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by demand weakness as businesses operated with  reduced onsite capacity and a majority of office workers continue to work from home. ASPs decreased 15.9% and printer unit volume decreased  5.1% as compared to the prior-year period. Printer ASPs decreased primarily due to mix shifts and unfavorable foreign currency impact. The  decrease in printer unit volume was driven by unit decreases in both Commercial and Consumer Hardware.

The printer unit volume decline was due to lower demand as businesses operated with reduced onsite capacity due to  COVID-19. The decrease in ASPs was driven by mix shifts, competitive pricing and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Net revenue for Consumer Hardware decreased 0.7% as compared to the prior-year period, due to a decrease in printer unit volume by 2.7%  partially offset by 2.0% increase in ASPs. The printer unit volume decrease was driven by supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19. The increase  in ASPs was primarily due to disciplined pricing, partially offset by mix shifts and unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 1.9 percentage points for the fiscal year 2020 as compared to the  prior-year period, primarily due to lower net revenue in Commercial Hardware, higher Consumer mix, supply chain disruptions partially offset by  disciplined pricing and improved Supplies mix. Printing net revenue decreased 3.6% (decreased 3.0% on a constant currency basis) for fiscal year 2019 as compared to prior-year period. The  decline in net revenue was primarily driven by a decline in Supplies, Consumer Hardware revenue and unfavorable foreign currency impacts,  partially offset by an increase in Commercial Hardware revenue. Net revenue for Supplies decreased 4.8% as compared to the prior-year period,  primarily due to demand weakness. Printer unit volume decreased 4.8% compared to the prior-year period. The decrease in printer unit volume  was driven by unit decrease in Consumer Hardware. Net revenue for Commercial Hardware increased 2.2% as compared to the prior-year period, primarily due to the acquisition of the Apogee group. Net revenue for Consumer Hardware decreased 6.7% as compared to the prior-year period due to a 5.4% decrease in printer unit volume and  1.7% decrease in ASPs. The unit volume decrease was driven by InkJet Home Consumer business and LaserJet Home business. The decrease in  ASPs was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Printing earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.1 percentage points for the fiscal year 2019 as compared to the  prior-year period, primarily due to higher gross margin. The gross margin increased primarily due to rate improvement in Commercial Hardware  partially offset by lower Supplies revenue. The loss from operations in Corporate Investments for the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to expenses associated with HP  Labs and our incubation and investment projects. Liquidity and Capital Resources We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. While the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic are currently expected  to be temporary, there is uncertainty around its extent and duration and our liquidity and working capital needs may be impacted in the future  periods. We believe that current cash, cash flow from operating activities, new borrowings, available commercial paper authorization and the  credit facilities will be sufficient to meet HP’s operating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all  borrowings, pension and post-retirement funding requirements, authorized share repurchases and annual dividend payments for the foreseeable  future. Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition that offer good return opportunities, the Company  may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through additional borrowings. While our access to capital markets may be  constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions, our access to a variety of funding  sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. Our liquidity is subject  to various risks including the risks identified in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled  “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A, which are incorporated herein by reference. On February 22, 2020, HP’s Board of Directors increased HP’s share repurchase authorization to $15.0 billion. 44 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Our cash and cash equivalents balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world. We utilize a variety of planning and financing  strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Amounts held outside of the United States are  generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs and may from time to time be distributed to the United States. The TCJA made significant  changes to the U.S. tax law, including a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. The payments associated with this one-time  transition tax will be paid over eight years and began in fiscal year 2019. We expect a significant portion of the cash and cash equivalents held  by our foreign subsidiaries will no longer be subject to U.S. income tax upon a subsequent repatriation to the United States as a result of the  transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings. However, a portion of this cash may still be subject to foreign income tax or withholding tax upon  repatriation. As we evaluate the future cash needs of our operations, we may revise the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently  reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries and how to utilize such funds, including reducing our gross debt level, or other uses. (1)  Includes highly liquid U.S. treasury notes, U.S. agency securities, non-U.S. government bonds, corporate debt securities, money market and other funds. We  classify these investments within Other current assets in Consolidated Balance Sheets, including those with maturity dates beyond one year, based on their  highly liquid nature and availability for use in current operations. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $0.3 billion for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower  cash generated from working capital activities as a result of changes in demand dynamics due to COVID-19 and lower earnings from operation. Net cash provided by operating activities increased marginally by $0.1 billion for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018. In billions Cash and cash equivalents $ 4.9  $ 4.5  $ 5.2  Marketable debt securities(1) $ 0.3  $ —  $ 0.7  Total debt $ 6.2  $ 5.1  $ 6.0 The cash conversion cycle is the sum of days of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to  differ from a long-term sustainable rate include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms, extent of receivables  factoring, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period. DSO measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable, net of  allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. For fiscal year 2020, the decrease in DSO as compared to fiscal year 2019,  was due to favorable revenue linearity and strong collections. For fiscal year 2019, the increase in DSO as compared to fiscal year 2018, was  primarily due to unfavorable revenue linearity. DOS measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day  average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal year 2020, the increase in DOS as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to leveraging our  balance sheet, particularly through higher strategic buys. For fiscal year 2019, the decrease in DOS compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily  due to reduction in inventory driven by reclassification of certain balances to other current assets pursuant to adoption of the new revenue  standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. DPO measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts  payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal year 2020, the decrease in DPO compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to  decrease in accounts payables driven by lower operating expenses. For fiscal year 2019, the increase in DPO compared to fiscal year 2018 was  higher primarily due to working capital management activities, partially offset by lower inventory purchasing volume. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $0.6 billion for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to increase in  investment classified as available-for-sale within Other current assets of $1.0 billion partially offset by lower net payments for acquisitions of  $0.5 billion. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.3 billion for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to lower net  payments for acquisitions. Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $1.9 billion in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to issuance of senior  notes of $3.0 billion partially offset by higher share repurchase of $0.7 billion and higher debt payment of $0.3 billion. Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $0.8 billion in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to lower payment of  debt of $1.5 billion, partially offset by a decrease in outstanding commercial paper amounts of $0.7 billion. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Management utilizes current cash conversion cycle information to manage our working capital level. The table below presents the cash  conversion cycle: 46 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries We maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for  operations, investment plans (including acquisitions), share repurchase activities, our cost of capital and targeted leverage ratio. Short-term debt increased by $0.3 billion and long-term debt increased by $0.8 billion for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019. The  net increase in total debt was primarily due to issuance of unsecured senior debt in June 2020 in principal amount of $3.0 billion, partially offset  by the payment of $1.6 billion for the cash tender offer (“Tender Offer”) and the redemption of existing notes maturing in 2020 and 2021. Short-term debt decreased by $1.1 billion for fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 primarily due to a decrease in outstanding  commercial paper amounts of $0.9 billion. Our debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders’ deficit. Our debt-to-equity ratio changed by  1.5x in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to an increase in stockholders’ deficit balance of $1.0 billion.  Our debt-to-equity ratio changed by 5.1x in fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018, primarily due to an increase in stockholders’ deficit  balance of $0.6 billion. Our weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect  of interest rate swaps. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 10, “Financial Instruments” in the Consolidated Financial  Statements and notes thereto in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. As of October 31, 2020, we maintain a senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion,  which will be available until March 30, 2023 and is primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper. On May 29, 2020, we entered into  a 364-day revolving credit facility providing for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $1.0 billion,  which will be available until May 28, 2021. Funds borrowed under these revolving credit facilities may be used for general corporate purposes.  On June 17, 2020, we issued $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes across various maturities.  We used approximately $0.7  billion and $0.9 billion of the proceeds from such issuance to fund the Tender Offer and the redemption, respectively, of existing notes maturing in  2020 and 2021.  For more information on the new notes and the repurchase and redemption of existing notes, see Note 11, “Borrowings”, to the  Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference. Dollars in millions Short-term debt $ 674 $ 357 $ 1,463 Long-term debt $5,543 $ 4,780 $ 4,524 Debt-to-equity ratio (2.8)x (4.3)x (9.4)x Weighted-average interest rate 3.9 % 4.6% 4.3 % HP Inc. and Subsidiaries As of October 31, 2020, we had available borrowing resources of $725 million from uncommitted lines of credit in addition to the senior  unsecured committed revolving credit facilities. In December 2020, we filed a post-effective amendment to the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement to include certain information that is required  to be included by registrants who are not well-known seasoned issuers (as such term is defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933, as  amended) because we will no longer be a well-known seasoned issuer upon the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Following the filing  of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we intend to file another post-effective amendment to convert the registration statement to the proper  submission type for a non-automatic shelf registration statement. Pending effectiveness of the second post-effective amendment, we can  continue to use the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement. Once it is declared effective, the further amended registration statement will enable us  to offer for sale, from time to time, in one or more offerings, $5.0 billion, in the aggregate, of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock,  depository shares and warrants. For more information on our borrowings, see Note 11, “Borrowings”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated  herein by reference. Our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our  ongoing discussions with them. While we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of  our debt, previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facility, have reduced market capacity for our commercial  paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. In addition, any further downgrade to our  credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner, and, depending on the extent of any such downgrade, could have  a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position. We can access alternative sources of funding, including drawdowns under our credit facility,  if necessary, to offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper. (1)  Amounts represent the principal cash payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments, discounts  or premiums. (2)  Amounts represent the expected interest payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt. We have outstanding interest rate swap agreements  accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our U.S. Dollar Global Notes to  variable interest rates. The impact of our outstanding interest rate swaps at October 31, 2020 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments  on debt. 48 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries (3)  Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms,  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These  purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty.  Purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to  quantify in a meaningful way. Even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to  cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. (4)  Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Contributions. In fiscal year 2021, we expect to contribute approximately $77 million to non-U.S. pension plans,  $34 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants and $5 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans. Our  policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities. Expected  contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not  represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more information on our  retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8,  which is incorporated herein by reference. (5)  Cost Savings Plans. As a result of our approved restructuring plans, we expect to make future cash payments of approximately $0.5 billion. We expect to make  future cash payments of $0.2 billion in fiscal year 2021 with remaining cash payments through fiscal year 2023. These payments have been excluded from the  contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more  information on our restructuring activities that are part of our cost improvements, see Note 3, “Restructuring and Other Charges”, to the Consolidated Financial  Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. (6)  Uncertain Tax Positions. As of October 31, 2020, we had approximately $475 million of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining  to uncertain tax positions. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when or if cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the  uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on  our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings”, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.  These potential payments have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is  uncertainty as to the timing of these potential payments. As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or  financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for  the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.  We have third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. For more  information on our third-party short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7 “Supplementary Financial Information” to the Consolidated  Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position  and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative instruments. We  use derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.  Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair value for each of these exposures are  outlined below. Actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign  currency exchange rate and interest rate movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the  effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets  and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in over 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most  significant foreign currencies to our operations for fiscal year 2020 were the euro, Chinese yuan renminbi, the Japanese yen and the British  pound. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely  affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar  may adversely affect certain expense figures, if taken alone. We use a combination of forward contracts and at times, options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency  exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent in cost of sales. In addition, when debt is denominated in a  foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts  to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments  consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the risk  associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the  same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to hedge. We have performed sensitivity analyses for continuing operations as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, using a modeling technique that measures  the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to  the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative contracts offset by underlying  exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at  October 31, 2020 and 2019. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates  would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $77 million and $81 million at October 31, 2020 and October 31, 2019, respectively. We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio. We issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. We may use interest  rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve  floating interest expense. The swap  transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating  interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. In order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into  variable interest returns. We may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability in interest income received on certain variable-rate investments.  We may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns. We have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair  values arising from a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held  constant. The analyses cover our debt, investments and interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt,  investments and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2020 and 2019.  The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would have resulted in a loss in the fair values of  our debt and investments, net of interest rate swaps, of $36 million at October 31, 2020 and $49 million at October 31, 2019. 50 HP Inc. ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of HP Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HP Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 31, 2020 and 2019,  the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the  period ended October 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  In our opinion, the  consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at October 31, 2020 and 2019, and  the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally  accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the  Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated December 10, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for recognizing revenue in 2019 due to  the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and the amendments  effective November 1, 2018 and its method of accounting for leases in 2020 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.  2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) effective November 1, 2019. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s  financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent  with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and  Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits  included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and  performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and  disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by  management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for  our opinion. The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were  communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the  financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters  does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical  audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 52 HP Inc. Income Taxes  Description of   the Matter As described in Notes 1 and 6 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in  the United States and several other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of those  jurisdictions. Uncertainty in the Company’s tax positions may arise as tax laws are subject to interpretation and the  Company’s positions are subject to examination by taxing authorities, which may result in assessments of additional  amounts owed.  Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects  requires significant management judgment in estimating whether a tax position’s technical merits are more-likely-than- not to be sustained and measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Revenue Recognition Description of   the Matter As described in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company enters into certain contracts to sell their  products and services that contain non-standard terms and conditions and multiple performance obligations.  For such  contracts, significant interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate accounting, including the allocation  of the transaction price among performance obligations in the arrangement and the timing of the transfer of control of  promised goods or services for each of those performance obligations. Additionally, the Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount which are more likely  than not to be realized. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers certain subjective factors  such as future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which they  operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.  Our assessment of management’s analyses of the reserve for uncertain tax positions and the realizability of its deferred  tax assets are significant to our audit because the amounts are material to the financial statements and the assessment  process involves significant judgment.  For example, management’s assumptions that may be affected by future market  and economic conditions or interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings are challenging to audit. We tested controls over management’s processes relating to the recording of unrecognized tax benefits, including controls  over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its uncertain tax positions, and the realizability of deferred  tax assets, including the development of the above described assumptions and judgments. Our audit procedures included an evaluation of the Company’s key assumptions and judgments and testing the  completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used to determine the amount of unrecognized tax benefits recognized.  For example, we evaluated the measurement of the amounts recorded taking into consideration the applicable tax laws  and the Company’s positions examined by taxing authorities. We also evaluated the key assumptions and judgments  used by management in determining the need for a valuation allowance and testing the completeness and accuracy of  the underlying data used in the Company’s process. For example, we compared the projections of future taxable income  with the actual results of prior periods as well as management’s consideration of current industry and economic trends. In  each of these areas, we involved our tax professionals to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions. This  included assessing the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating income tax opinions or  other third-party advice obtained by the Company. In addition, the Company reduces revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including rebates,  promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns.  The Company uses significant estimates to determine  the expected variable consideration for such programs based on factors like historical experience, forecasted sales,  expected customer behavior and market conditions. Our assessment of management’s evaluation of the appropriate accounting for revenue contracts and the determination of  the variable consideration for sales incentives are significant to our audit because the amounts are material to the financial  statements and the assessment process involves significant judgment. 54 HP Inc. How We   Addressed the  Matter in   Our Audit We tested relevant controls over the identified risks related to the Company’s accounting for revenue recognition,  including the controls to evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment for contracts containing non-standard terms and  conditions and multiple performance obligations and the controls related to the estimation process to record the variable  consideration related to certain sales incentives. Our audit procedures included, among others, inspection of contracts entered into during the period, evaluation of  management’s judgments related to the interpretation of certain contract provisions including the identification  of performance obligations, the method of allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the  arrangement, and the assessment of the appropriateness of the amount of revenue recognized.  We also evaluated the  Company’s key assumptions and judgments and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used to  determine the variable consideration for sales incentives. This included analyzing data related to the historical experience  of sales incentive payments as well as understanding the current market dynamics that can affect the estimate of variable  consideration to assess the Company’s judgments and estimates. To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of HP Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited HP Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal  Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the  COSO criteria). In our opinion, HP Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial  reporting as of October 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the  consolidated balance sheets of HP Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of earnings,  comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2020, and the related  notes and our report dated December 10, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the  effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial  Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a  public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.  federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other  procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A  company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in  reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance  that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and  directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or  disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any  evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or  that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. HP’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.

HP’s management assessed the effectiveness of HP’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020, utilizing the criteria set  forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013  framework). Based on the assessment by HP’s management, we determined that HP’s internal control over financial reporting was effective  as of October 31, 2020. The effectiveness of HP’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020 has been audited by Ernst &  Young LLP, HP’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 56 of this Annual Report on  Form 10-K. 56 HP Inc.

HP Inc. and Subsidiaries The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements of HP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of HP and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which HP has a controlling financial interest  or is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. HP has reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year presentation. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the  amounts reported in HP’s Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.  As of October 31, 2020, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business going forward depends on numerous dynamic  factors which we cannot reliably predict. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions required increased judgment and may carry a  higher degree of variability and volatility. As the events continue to evolve with respect to the pandemic, our estimates may materially change in  future periods. HP predominantly uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are remeasured into U.S.  dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities.  Net revenue, costs and expenses denominated in non-U.S. dollars are recorded in U.S. dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing  during the period. HP includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements  of Earnings. Certain foreign subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and HP records the translation of their assets  and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet dates as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other  comprehensive loss. On November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard Company completed the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (“Hewlett Packard  Enterprise”), Hewlett-Packard Company’s former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses (the  “Separation”). In connection with the Separation, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into a separation and distribution agreement, an  employee matters agreement and various other agreements which remain enforceable and provide a framework for the continuing relationships  between the parties. For more information on the impacts of these agreements, see Note 7, “Supplementary Financial Information”, Note 14,  “Litigation and Contingencies” and Note 15, “Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties”. In August 2017, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for derivatives and hedging. The amendment  improves the financial reporting of hedging relationships to better represent the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in  its financial statements and made certain targeted improvements to simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance in current U.S.  GAAP. HP adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The implementation of this guidance did not have a material impact on its  Consolidated Financial Statements. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries In February 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance on the accounting for leasing transactions. The primary objective of this update is to  increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize a lease liability for the obligation to make lease  payments and a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset for the right to use the underlying asset over the lease term. The guidance also results in some  changes to lessor accounting and requires additional disclosures about all leasing arrangements. HP adopted the standard (the “new lease standard”) as of November 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative  effect adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of the adoption date. HP elected to apply the practical expedient using the  transition option whereby prior comparative periods were not retrospectively adjusted in the Consolidated Financial Statements. HP also elected  the package of practical expedients, which does not require reassessment of initial direct costs, classification of a lease, and definition of a lease.  The Company has elected not to record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease expense on  such leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. HP has also elected the lessee practical expedient to combine lease and  non-lease components for certain asset classes. The adoption of the new lease standard resulted in the recognition of $1.2 billion in operating lease liabilities and $1.2 billion of related ROU  assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net impact of adoption to accumulated deficit as on November 1, 2019 is not material. As of  November 1, 2019, there were no material finance leases for which HP was a lessee. The new lease standard also made some changes to lessor accounting, including alignment with the new revenue recognition standard. HP now  records revenue upfront on certain aspects of its as-a-service offerings and reflects financing of these offerings as cash flows from financing  activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These changes did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 17, “Leases”, for additional disclosures related to leases. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which requires credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the  net amount expected to be collected, not based on incurred losses. Further, credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded  through an allowance for credit losses limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost. HP will adopt the guidance in the first  quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a modified retrospective approach. HP has evaluated the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial  statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems and does not expect it to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial  Statements. HP recognizes revenues at a point in time or over time depicting the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration to which HP expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. HP follows the five-step model for revenue  recognition as summarized below: 1.	 Identify	the	contract	with	a	customer	- A contract with customer exists when (i) it is approved and signed by all parties, (ii) each party’s rights  and obligations can be identified, (iii) payment terms are defined, (iv) it has commercial substance and (v) the customer has the ability and  intent to pay. HP evaluates customers’ ability to pay based on various factors like historical payment experience, financial metrics and  customer credit scores. While the majority of our sales contracts contain standard terms and conditions, there are certain contracts with non- standard terms and conditions. 2.	 Identify	the	performance	obligations	in	the	contract	- HP evaluates each performance obligation in an arrangement to determine whether it  is distinct, such as hardware and/or service. A performance obligation constitutes distinct goods or services when the customer can benefit  from such goods or services either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and the performance  obligation is distinct within the context of the contract. 64 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Determine	the	transaction	price	- Transaction price is the amount of consideration to which HP expects to be entitled in exchange for  transferring goods or services to the customer. If the transaction price includes a variable amount, HP estimates the amount it expects to  be entitled to using either the expected value or the most likely amount method. HP reduces the transaction price at the time of revenue  recognition for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected  returns. HP uses estimates to determine the expected variable consideration for such programs based on factors like historical experience,  expected consumer behavior and market conditions. HP has elected the practical expedient of not accounting for significant financing components if the period between revenue recognition and  when the customer pays for the product or service is one year or less. Allocate	the	transaction	price	to	performance	obligations	in	the	contract	- When a sales arrangement contains multiple performance  obligations, such as hardware and/or services, HP allocates revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to their selling price. The  selling price for each performance obligation is based on its Standalone Selling Price (“SSP”). HP establishes SSP using the price charged  for a performance obligation when sold separately (“observable price”) and, in some instances, using the price established by management  having the relevant authority. When observable price is not available, HP establishes SSP based on management judgment considering  internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle.  Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles. Recognize	revenue	when	(or	as)	the	performance	obligation	is	satisfied - Revenue is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is  satisfied by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. HP generally invoices the customer upon delivery of the goods  or services and the payments are due as per contract terms. For fixed price support or maintenance contracts that are in the nature of stand- ready obligations, payments are generally received in advance from customers and revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the  duration of the contract. HP reports revenue net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, and the collected taxes are recorded as  other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority. HP includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of revenue. HP records revenue on a gross basis when HP is a principal in the transaction and on a net basis when HP is acting as an agent between the  customer and the vendor. HP considers several factors to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent, most notably whether HP is  the primary obligor to the customer, has established its own pricing and has inventory and credit risks. HP transfers control of the products to the customer at the time the product is delivered to the customer and recognizes revenue accordingly,  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations to the customer remain unfulfilled. HP records revenue from the sale of  equipment under sales-type leases as revenue at the commencement of the lease. HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price support, maintenance and other service contracts over time depicting the pattern of service delivery and  recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred. Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that HP has transferred to a customer when such right is conditional  on something other than the passage of time. Such contract assets are not material to HP’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Contract liabilities are recorded as deferred revenues when amounts invoiced to customers are more than the revenues recognized or when  payments are received in advance for fixed-price support or maintenance contracts. The short-term and long-term deferred revenues are  reported within the other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities respectively. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract primarily consist of sales commissions. HP has elected the practical expedient to expense as  incurred the costs to obtain a contract with a benefit period equal to or less than one year. For contracts with a period of benefit greater than one  year, HP capitalizes incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and amortizes these costs over their expected period of benefit  provided such costs are recoverable. Fulfillment costs consist of set-up and transition costs related to other service contracts. These costs generate or enhance resources of HP that  will be used in satisfying the performance obligation in the future and are capitalized and amortized over the expected period of the benefit,  provided such costs are recoverable. See Note 7, “Supplementary Financial Information” for details on net revenue by region, cost to obtain a contract and fulfillment cost, contract  liabilities and value of remaining performance obligations. HP adopted the new revenue standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts that  were not completed as of November 1, 2018. HP recognized the net impact of adoption as an increase to accumulated deficit by $212 million, net  of tax, on November 1, 2018. At the inception of a contract, HP assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on (1) whether the contract  involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether HP obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset  throughout the period, and (3) whether HP has the right to direct the use of the asset. All significant lease arrangements are recognized at lease commencement. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not  recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Consolidated Statement of  Earnings. HP determines the lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options that are reasonably certain. As most of the leases do not  provide an implicit interest rate, HP uses the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate at the  commencement date to determine the present value of future payments that are reasonably certain. HP determines stock-based compensation expense based on the measurement date fair value of the award. HP recognizes compensation cost  only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period  of the award. HP determines compensation costs at the aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level  for awards with performance and/or market conditions. HP estimates the forfeiture rate based on its historical experience. HP has various defined benefit, other contributory and non-contributory retirement and post-retirement plans. HP generally amortizes  unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life of participants. In limited  cases, HP amortizes actuarial gains and losses using the corridor approach. See Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans” for a full  description of these plans and the accounting and funding policies. Costs to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the advertising is  first run. Such costs totaled approximately $578 million, $652 million and $568 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 66 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP records charges associated with management-approved restructuring plans to reorganize one or more of HP’s business segments, to  remove duplicative headcount and infrastructure associated with business acquisitions or to simplify business processes and accelerate  innovation. Restructuring charges can include severance costs to reduce a specified number of employees, enhanced early retirement incentives,  infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. HP records restructuring charges based  on estimated employee terminations, committed early retirements and site closure and consolidation plans. HP accrues for severance and other  employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates  used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. Other charges include  non-recurring costs, including those as a result of Separation, information technology rationalization efforts and proxy contest activities, and are  distinct from ongoing operational costs. HP recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets  and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. HP records a  valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. HP records accruals for uncertain tax positions when HP believes that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on  examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. HP makes adjustments to these accruals when facts and  circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of  adjustments for uncertain tax positions, as well as any related interest and penalties. HP establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable. HP records a specific reserve for individual accounts when HP  becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer’s operating  results or financial position. If there are additional changes in circumstances related to the specific customer, HP further adjusts estimates of the  recoverability of receivables. HP maintains bad debt reserves for all other customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of third-party  credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of customers,  the length of time receivables are past due, trends in the weighted-average risk rating for the portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, information  derived from competitive benchmarking, significant one-time events and historical experience. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable  is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable. HP has third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. These  financing arrangements, which in certain cases provide for partial recourse, result in the transfer of HP’s trade receivables to a third party.  HP reflects amounts transferred to, but not yet collected from the third party in accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For  arrangements involving an element of recourse, the fair value of the recourse obligation is measured using market data from similar transactions  and reported as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Financial instruments that potentially subject HP to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents,  investments, receivables from trade customers and contract manufacturers and derivatives. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These  financial institutions are located in many different geographic regions, and HP’s policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution.  As part of its risk management processes, HP performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions. HP  has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. HP utilizes derivative contracts to protect against  the effects of foreign currency, interest rate and, on certain investment exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the  counterparty, which could result in a material loss. The likelihood of which HP deems to be remote. HP sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant  receivable balances with these parties. If the financial condition or operations of these distributors’ and resellers’ aggregated business  deteriorates substantially, HP’s operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest distributor and reseller receivable balances, which  were concentrated primarily in North America and Europe, collectively represented approximately 47% and 32% of gross accounts receivable as  of October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of gross accounts receivable as of October 31, 2020  or 2019. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable is generally diversified due to HP’s large customer base and their dispersion across  many different industries and geographic markets. HP performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its third-party distributors,  resellers and other customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. HP utilizes outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. HP may purchase product components from  suppliers and sell those components to its outsourced manufacturers thereby creating receivable balances from the outsourced manufacturers.  The three largest outsourced manufacturer receivable balances collectively represented 89% and 77% of HP’s supplier receivables of $1.2 billion  and $1.2 billion as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. HP includes the supplier receivables in Other current assets in the Consolidated  Balance Sheets on a gross basis. HP’s credit risk associated with these receivables is mitigated wholly or in part, by the amount HP owes to these  outsourced manufacturers, as HP generally has the legal right to offset its payables to the outsourced manufacturers against these receivables.  HP does not reflect the sale of these components in net revenue and does not recognize any profit on these component sales until the related  products are sold by HP, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction to cost of revenue. HP obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations.  The loss of a single source supplier, the deterioration of HP’s relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the  contractual terms under which HP is supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect HP’s net revenue, cash flows and  gross margins. Upon completion of the Separation on November 1, 2015, HP recorded net income tax indemnification receivables from Hewlett Packard  Enterprise for certain income tax liabilities that HP is jointly and severally liable for, but for which it is indemnified by Hewlett Packard Enterprise  under the tax matters agreement (“TMA”). The TMA was terminated during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. HP values inventory at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out  basis. Adjustments, if required, to reduce the cost of inventory to market (net realizable value) are made, for estimated excess, obsolete or  impaired balances. HP reflects property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. HP capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses  maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  Estimated useful lives are five to 40 years for buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. HP depreciates  leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. HP depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term  of the lease to the equipment’s estimated residual value. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are  removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 68 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP capitalizes external costs and directly attributable internal costs to acquire or create internal use software which are incurred subsequent  to the completion of the preliminary project stage. These costs relate to activities such as software design, configuration, coding, testing, and  installation. Costs related to post-implementation activities such as training and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Once the software is  substantially complete and ready for its intended use, capitalized development costs are amortized straight-line over the estimated useful life of  the software, generally not to exceed five years. HP also enters into certain cloud-based software hosting arrangements that are accounted for as service contracts. For internal-use software  obtained through a hosting arrangement that is in the nature of a service contract, HP incurs certain implementation costs such as integrating,  configuring, and software customization, which are consistent with costs incurred during the application development stage for on-premise  software. HP applies the same guidance to determine costs that are eligible for capitalization. For these arrangements, HP amortizes the  capitalized development costs straight-line over the fixed, non-cancellable term of the associated hosting arrangement plus any reasonably  certain renewal periods. HP also applies the same impairment model to both internal-use software and capitalized implementation costs in a  software hosting arrangement that is in the nature of a service contract. HP includes the results of operations of the acquired business in HP’s consolidated results prospectively from the acquisition date. HP allocates  the purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity generally based  on their fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired,  liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include  the value of the synergies between the acquired company and HP, and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualify  for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related charges are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as  incurred. These charges primarily include, direct third-party professional and legal fees, and integration-related costs. HP reviews goodwill for impairment annually during its fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying  amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. HP can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to test a reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment or  HP can directly perform the quantitative impairment test. Based on the qualitative assessment, if HP determines that the fair value of a reporting  unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will  be performed. In the quantitative impairment test, HP compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount with the fair values derived most  significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, HP estimates the fair value  of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. HP bases cash flow projections on management’s estimates  of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. HP bases the discount rate on the  weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the  reporting unit’s ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, HP estimates fair value based on market multiples of  revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting  unit. HP weights the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to  the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, HP estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the  income approach. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries In order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of HP’s reporting units, HP compares the aggregate reporting unit fair value to  HP’s market capitalization on an overall basis and calculates an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair value  over HP’s market capitalization on an overall basis). HP evaluates the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from  recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is determined to not be reasonable in light of these recent transactions, HP re- evaluates its reporting unit fair values, which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate and/or other assumptions. This re-evaluation could  result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all reporting units. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired. If the  fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over the  fair value is recognized as an impairment loss. HP determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re-evaluates the classifications at each balance sheet  date. Debt and marketable equity securities are generally considered available-for-sale. All highly liquid investments with maturities of three  months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. Marketable debt securities with maturities of twelve months or less are  classified as short-term investments and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than twelve months are classified based on their  availability for use in current operations. Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short-term or long-term  based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in current operations. Debt and marketable equity securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, in Accumulated other  comprehensive loss, Consolidated Statement of Earnings and the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale  securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of  Earnings. HP monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis. When the carrying amount of an investment in debt  securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary (i.e., when HP does not intend to sell the debt  securities and it is not more likely than not that HP will be required to sell the debt securities prior to anticipated recovery of its amortized cost  basis), HP records an impairment charge to Interest and other, net in the amount of the credit loss and the remaining amount, if any, is recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, treasury rate locks and at times, options, to hedge certain foreign currency, interest  rate, and return on certain investment exposures. HP also may use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards used  to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. HP does not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 10, “Financial  Instruments” for a full description of HP’s derivative instrument activities and related accounting policies. HP is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP records a liability for  contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. See  Note 14, “Litigation and Contingencies” for a full description of HP’s loss contingencies and related accounting policies. 70 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP is a leading global provider of personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing products, and related technologies,  solutions and services. HP sells to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) and large enterprises, including  customers in the government, health and education sectors. HP goes to market through its extensive channel network and direct sales. HP’s operations are organized into three reportable segments: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments. HP’s organizational  structure is based on many factors that the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which  include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational  structure and information reviewed by HP’s CODM to evaluate segment results. The CODM uses several metrics to evaluate the performance of  the overall business, including earnings from operations, and uses these results to allocate resources to each of the segments. Personal	Systems offers commercial and consumer desktop and notebook (“PCs”), workstations, thin clients, commercial mobility devices,  retail point-of-sale (“POS”) systems, displays and other related accessories, software, support and services. HP groups commercial notebooks,  commercial desktops, commercial services, commercial mobility devices, commercial detachables and convertibles, workstations, retail POS  systems and thin clients into commercial PCs and consumer notebooks, consumer desktops, consumer services and consumer detachables into  consumer PCs when describing performance in these markets. Described below are HP’s global business capabilities within Personal Systems: — Commercial	PCs are optimized for use by enterprise, public sector which includes education, and SMB customers, with a focus on robust  designs, security, serviceability, connectivity, reliability and manageability in networked and cloud-based environments. Additionally, HP  offers a range of services and solutions to enterprise, public sector and SMB customers to help them manage the lifecycle of their PC and  mobility installed base. — Consumer	PCs are optimized for consumer usage, focusing on gaming, learning and working remotely, consuming multi-media for  entertainment, managing personal life activities, staying connected, sharing information, getting things done for work including creating  content, staying informed and secure. Personal Systems groups its global business capabilities into the following business units when reporting business performance:   — Notebooks	consists of consumer notebooks, commercial notebooks, mobile workstations and commercial mobility devices;   —  Desktops	includes consumer desktops, commercial desktops, thin clients, and retail POS systems;   — Workstations	consists of desktop workstations and accessories; and   — Other	consists of consumer and commercial services as well as other Personal Systems capabilities.

HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Corporate	Investments includes HP Labs and certain business incubation and investment projects. The accounting policies HP uses to derive segment results are substantially the same as those used by HP in preparing these financial  statements. HP derives the results of the business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. HP does not allocate certain operating expenses, which it manages at the corporate level, to its segments. These unallocated amounts include  certain corporate governance costs and infrastructure investments, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges,  acquisition-related charges and amortization of intangible assets. 72 HP Inc. No single country other than those represented above exceeds 10% or more of HP’s total net property, plant and equipment in any fiscal  year presented. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP allocates assets to its business segments based on the segments primarily benefiting from the assets. Total assets by segment and the  reconciliation of segment assets to HP consolidated assets were as follows: No single customer represented 10% or more of HP’s net revenue in any fiscal year presented. Net revenue by country is based upon the sales location that predominately represents the customer location. For each of the fiscal years of  2020, 2019 and 2018, other than the United States, no country represented more than 10% of HP net revenue. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries On September 30, 2019, HP’s Board of Directors approved the Fiscal 2020 Plan intended to optimize and simplify its operating model and  cost structure that HP expects will be implemented through fiscal 2022. HP expects to reduce global headcount by approximately 7,000 to  9,000 employees through a combination of employee exits and voluntary EER. HP estimates that it will incur pre-tax charges of approximately  $1.0 billion relating to labor and non-labor actions. HP expects to incur approximately $0.9 billion primarily in labor costs related to workforce  reductions and the remaining costs will relate to non-labor actions and other charges. Other charges include non-recurring costs, including those as a result of Separation, information technology rationalization efforts and proxy  contest activities, and are distinct from ongoing operational costs. These costs primarily relate to third-party legal, professional services and other  non-recurring costs. HP incurred $105 million, $28 million and $33 million of other charges in fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 74 HP Inc. (1)  Primarily includes the fiscal 2017 plan along with other legacy plans, all of which are substantially complete. HP does not expect any further material activity  associated with these plans. (2)  Includes reclassification of liability related to the Enhanced Early Retirement (“EER”) plan of $44 million for certain healthcare and medical savings account  benefits to pension and other post retirement plans. See Note 4 “Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans” for further information. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans worldwide. The most significant defined benefit plan, the HP Inc. Pension Plan (“Pension  Plan”) is a frozen plan in the United States. HP reduces the benefit payable to certain U.S. employees under the Pension Plan for service before 1993, if any, by any amounts due to the  employee under HP’s frozen defined contribution Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (“DPSP”). At October 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of plan  assets of the DPSP was $463 million and $543 million, respectively. The DPSP obligations are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as  an offset to the Pension Plan when HP calculates its defined benefit pension cost and obligations. The Pension Plan and the DPSP both remain  entirely with HP post-Separation. HP sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, of which the most significant are in the United States. Under the HP Inc. Retiree Welfare  Benefits Plan, certain pre-2003 retirees and grandfathered participants with continuous service to HP since 2002 are eligible to receive partially  subsidized medical coverage based on years of service at retirement. HP’s share of the premium cost is capped for all subsidized medical  coverage provided under the HP Inc. Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan. HP currently leverages the employer group waiver plan process to provide HP  Inc. Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan post-65 prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D, thereby giving HP access to federal subsidies to help  pay for retiree benefits. Certain employees not grandfathered for partially subsidized medical coverage under the above programs, and employees hired after 2002 but  before August 2008, are eligible for credits under the HP Inc. Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan. Credits offered after September 2008 are provided in  the form of matching credits on employee contributions made to a voluntary employee beneficiary association upon attaining age 45 or as part of  early retirement programs. On retirement, former employees may use these credits for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses,  including premiums required for coverage. HP offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution expense was $108 million in fiscal year  2020, $107 million in fiscal year 2019 and $110 million in fiscal year 2018. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the HP Inc. 401(k) Plan when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation.  The employer matching contributions in the HP Inc. 401(k) Plan is 100% of the first 4% of eligible compensation contributed by employees, and  the employer match is vested after three years of employee service. Generally, an employee must be employed by HP Inc. on the last day of the  calendar year to receive a match. The components of net periodic benefit costs other than the service cost component are included in Interest and other, net in our Consolidated  Statements of Earnings.

Defined  Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined  Benefit Plans Post-Retirement  Benefit Plans Defined  Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined  Benefit Plans Defined  Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined  Benefit Plans HP Inc. and Subsidiaries The table below sets forth the fair value of plan assets by asset category within the fair value hierarchy as of October 31, 2020. Refer to Note 9,  “Fair Value” for details on fair value hierarchy. Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share as a  practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table provide a reconciliation of  the fair value hierarchy to the total value of plan assets. 80 HP Inc. Government — 1,758 — 1,758 — 4 — 4 — 136 — 136 Corporate — 5,891 — 5,891 — 124 — 124 — 53 — 53 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Post-Retirement Benefit Plans As of October 31, 2020 (1)  Investments in publicly traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported on the stock exchange on which the  individual securities are traded. (2)  The fair value of corporate, government and asset-backed debt securities is based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions. Also included in  this category is debt issued by national, state and local governments and agencies. (3)  Department of Labor 103-12 IE (Investment Entity) designation is for plan assets held by two or more unrelated employee benefit plans which includes limited  partnerships and venture capital partnerships. Certain common collective trusts and interests in 103-12 entities are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. (4)  Includes publicly traded funds of investment companies that are registered with the SEC, funds that are not publicly traded and a non-U.S. fund-of-fund  arrangement. The non-U.S. fund-of-fund arrangement is a custom portfolio valued at NAV consisting primarily of fixed income and common contractual funds. (5)  Includes cash and cash equivalents such as short-term marketable securities. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds, which are valued based  on NAV. Other assets were classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input (e.g., quoted prices and observable inputs) that is significant to  the fair value measure in its entirety. (6)  Includes primarily reverse repurchase agreements, unsettled transactions, and derivative instruments. (7)  These investments include alternative investments, which primarily consist of private equities and hedge funds. The valuation of alternative investments, such  as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management judgment. For alternative investments, valuation is based on NAV as reported  by the asset manager or investment company and adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety of factors are reviewed by  management, including but not limited to the timeliness of NAV as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions  subsequent to the last NAV reported by the asset manager. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries The table below sets forth the fair value of plan assets by asset category within the fair value hierarchy as of October 31, 2019. — Private equities include limited partnerships such as equity, buyout, venture capital, real estate and other similar funds that invest in the United States and  internationally where foreign currencies are hedged. Government — 2,979 — 2,979 — 19 — 19 — 61 — 61 Corporate — 6,098 — 6,098 — 139 — 139 — 40 — 40 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plans Post-Retirement Benefit Plans As of October 31, 2019 In addition, these investments include the Common Contractual Fund, which is an investment arrangement in which institutional investors pool their assets.  Units may be acquired in different sub-funds focused on equities, fixed income, alternative investments and emerging markets. Each sub-fund is invested in  accordance with the fund’s investment objective and units are issued in relation to each sub-fund. While the sub-funds are not publicly traded, the custodian  strikes a NAV either once or twice a month, depending on the sub-fund. These assets are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments also  include Common Collective Trusts and 103-12 Investment Entities as defined in note (3) above and Investment Funds as defined in note (4) above. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Refer to the fair value hierarchy table above for actual assets allocations across the benefit plans. The weighted-average target asset allocations  across the benefit plans represented in the fair value tables above were as follows: HP’s investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded status of each  plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the plans’ investment managers employ active investment management  strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across  asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans’ investment managers are  authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and HP may utilize derivatives to affect asset allocation changes or to hedge  certain investment or liability exposures. The target asset allocation selected for each U.S. plan (pension and post-retirement) reflects a risk/return profile HP believes is appropriate  relative to each plan’s liability structure and return goals. HP conducts periodic asset-liability studies for U.S. plans to model various potential  asset allocations in comparison to each plan’s forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs and to develop a policy glide path which adjusts the  asset allocation with funded status. A 2021 asset-liability study is planned to reconfirm the current policy glide path for the U.S. Pension Plan.  Due to the strong funded status for the U.S. Pension Plan and the high level of liability hedging in the pension assets, no material changes are  anticipated other than additional movement to fixed-income investments in the 401(h) account with the U.S. Pension Plan. HP invests a portion  of the U.S. defined benefit plan assets and post-retirement benefit plan assets in private market securities such as private equity funds to provide  diversification and a higher expected return on assets. Outside the United States, asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. As in the United  States, investment objectives are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In some countries, local  regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed-income securities than would otherwise  be deployed. HP reviews the investment strategy and where appropriate, can offer some assistance in the selection of investment managers, with  final decisions on asset allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees for the specific plan. 82 HP Inc.

Management of the hedge funds has the ability to shift investments from value to growth strategies, from small to  large capitalization stocks and bonds, and from a net long position to a net short position. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests and the  weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset  class and expected real returns which considers each country’s specific inflation outlook. Because HP’s investment policy is to employ primarily  active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted to reflect the expected additional  returns net of fees. As part of the Fiscal 2020 Plan, HP announced the voluntary EER program for its U.S. employees in October 2019. Voluntary participation in the  EER program was limited to those employees who were at least 50 years old with 20 or more years of service at HP. Employees accepted into the  EER program left HP on dates ranging from December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020. The EER benefit was a cash lump sum payment which  was calculated based on years of service at HP at the time of the retirement and ranging from 13 to 52 weeks of pay. All employees participating in the EER program were offered the opportunity to continue health care coverage at the active employee contribution  rates for up to 36 months following retirement. In addition, HP provided up to $12,000 in employer credits under the Retirement Medical Savings  Account (“RMSA”) program. In relation to the continued health care coverage and employer credits under the RMSA program, HP recognized  special termination benefit costs of $44 million as restructuring and other charges for the twelve months ended October 31, 2020. HP offered a lump sum program during the third quarter of fiscal year 2020. Certain terminated vested participants in the HP Inc. Pension  Plan (“Pension Plan”) could elect to take a one-time voluntary lump sum payment equal to the present value of future benefits. Approximately  12,000 participants elected the lump sum option. Payments of $2.2 billion were made from plan assets to the participants in the fourth quarter  of fiscal year 2020. A non-cash settlement expense of $214 million arising from the accelerated recognition of previously deferred actuarial  losses was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, HP expects to contribute approximately $77 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, $34 million to cover benefit payments to  U.S. non-qualified plan participants and $5 million to cover benefit claims for HP’s post-retirement benefit plans. HP’s policy is to fund its pension  plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities. Fiscal year U.S. Defined  Benefit Plans Non-U.S. Defined  Benefit Plans Post-Retirement  Benefit Plans HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP’s stock-based compensation plans include incentive compensation plans and an employee stock purchase plan. HP’s stock-based incentive compensation plans include equity plans adopted in 2004 and 2000, as amended and restated (“principal equity  plans”), as well as various equity plans assumed through acquisitions under which stock-based awards are outstanding. Stock-based awards  granted under the principal equity plans include restricted stock awards, stock options and performance-based awards. Employees meeting  certain employment qualifications are eligible to receive stock-based awards. The aggregate number of shares of HP’s stock authorized for  issuance under the 2004 principal equity plan is 593.1 million. No further grants may be made under the 2000 principal equity plan and all  outstanding awards under this plan will remain outstanding according to the terms of the plan. Restricted stock awards are non-vested stock awards that may include grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards  and cash-settled awards are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Such awards generally  vest one to three years from the date of grant. During the vesting period, ownership of the restricted stock cannot be transferred. Restricted  stock has the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and is considered to be issued and outstanding upon grant. The dividends paid  on restricted stock are non-forfeitable. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted  stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. However, shares underlying restricted stock units are included in the calculation  of diluted net EPS. Restricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. HP expenses  the fair value of restricted stock awards ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse. The majority of restricted stock units issued by  HP contain only service vesting conditions. HP also grants performance-adjusted restricted stock units which vest only on the satisfaction of both  service and the achievement of certain performance goals including market conditions prior to the expiration of the awards. Stock options granted under the principal equity plans are generally non-qualified stock options, but the principal equity plans permit some  options granted to qualify as incentive stock options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Stock options generally vest over three to four years  from the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the closing price of HP’s stock on the option grant date. The majority of  stock options issued by HP contain only service vesting conditions. Starting in fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2016, HP granted performance- contingent stock options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions prior to the expiration of the awards. RSU and stock option grants provide for accelerated vesting in certain circumstances as defined in the plans and related grant agreements,  including termination in connection with a change in control. 84 HP Inc. Cash received from option exercises and purchases under the HP Inc. 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2011 ESPP”) was $56 million  in fiscal year 2020, $59 million in fiscal year 2019 and $158 million in fiscal year 2018. The benefit realized for the tax deduction from option  exercises in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $2 million, $3 million and $23 million, respectively. The total grant date fair value of restricted stock units vested in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $297 million, $273 million and  $224 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2020, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested  restricted stock units was $266 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.4 years. (1)  The expected volatility was estimated using the historical volatility derived from HP’s common stock. (2)  The risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues. (3)  The expected performance period was estimated based on the length of the remaining performance period from the grant date. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP uses the closing stock price on the grant date to estimate the fair value of service-based restricted stock units. HP estimates the fair value of  restricted stock units subject to performance-adjusted vesting conditions using a combination of the closing stock price on the grant date and the  Monte Carlo simulation model. The assumptions used to measure the fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-adjusted vesting  conditions in the Monte Carlo simulation model were as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Expected volatility(1) 27.6% 26.5% 29.5% Risk-free interest rate(2) 1.6% 2.7% 1.9% Expected performance period in years(3) 2.9 2.9 2.9 In  thousands In years In  millions In  thousands In years In  millions In  thousands In years In  millions Outstanding  at beginning  of year 7,093 $16 7,086 $14 18,067 $13 Granted 996 $18 2,451 $17 54 $21 Exercised (2,213) $14 (2,429) $13 (10,644) $13 Forfeited/ cancelled/ expired (239) $19 (15) $10 (391) $16 Outstanding at  end of year 5,637 $17 6.4 $10 7,093 $16 5.7 $15 7,086 $14 4.2 $73 Vested and  expected to  vest 5,637 $17 6.4 $10 7,093 $16 5.7 $15 7,084 $14 4.2 $73 Exercisable 3,196 $15 4.4 $ 9 4,707 $14 3.6 $15 4,707 $14 3.7 $49 HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-based vesting  conditions. HP estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte  Carlo simulation model and a lattice model as these awards contain market conditions. The weighted-average fair value and the assumptions  used to measure fair value were as follows: 86 HP Inc. (1)  The weighted-average fair value was based on stock options granted during the period. (2)  Expected volatility was estimated based on a blended volatility (50% historical volatility and 50% implied volatility from traded options on HP’s common stock).

The aggregate intrinsic value is the  difference between HP’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal year and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of  in-the-money options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $12 million, $20 million and  $109 million, respectively. The total grant date fair value of options vested in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $3 million, $9 million and  $12 million, respectively. As of October 31, 2020, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $7 million, which is expected  to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 1.5 years. HP sponsors the 2011 ESPP, pursuant to which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain income  limits, to purchase shares of HP’s common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the 2011 ESPP, employees purchase stock under the 2011 ESPP at a price equal to 95% of HP’s closing stock price on  the purchase date. No stock-based compensation expense was recorded in connection with those purchases because the criteria of a non- compensatory plan were met. The aggregate number of shares of HP’s stock authorized for issuance under the 2011 ESPP is 100 million. The  2021 ESPP comes into effect on May 1, 2021 upon expiry of the 2011 ESPP. The 2021 ESPP terms are similar to the current ESPP. The aggregate  number of shares of HP’s stock authorized for issuance under the 2021 ESPP is 50 million.

HP has elected to treat Global Minimum Tax inclusions as period costs. In fiscal year 2020, HP recorded $244 million of net income tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. This amount includes  tax benefits related to audit settlements of $124 million in various jurisdictions and $82 million related to restructuring benefits. Additionally, HP  recorded benefits of $20 million related to proxy contest costs and $17 million of other net tax benefits. In fiscal year 2020, excess tax benefits  associated with stock options, restricted stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units were immaterial. As a result of U.S. tax reform, HP revised its estimated annual effective tax rate to reflect the change in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from  35% to a transitional rate of 23.3% in fiscal year 2018. The 2019 and 2020 U.S. federal statutory tax rate is 21%. The differences between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and HP’s effective tax rate were as follows: HP Inc. and Subsidiaries 88 HP Inc. 2020 2019 2018 U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from operations 21.0% 21.0% 23.3% State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 1.4% 1.5% 0.5% Impact of foreign earnings including GILTI and FDII, net (6.1)% (4.4)% (10.9)% U.S. Tax Reform enactment —% (2.6)% (35.8)% Research and development (“R&D”) credit (0.7)% (1.1)% (0.7)% Valuation allowances 2.3% (3.7)% (9.3)% Uncertain tax positions and audit settlements (4.1)% (41.1)% (50.3)% Indemnification related items —% 6.8% 5.2% Other, net (1.8)% (1.3)% 1.2% 12.0% (24.9)% (76.8)% In millions U.S. federal taxes: Current $ (24) $(987) $ 751 Deferred (68) 149 (3,132) Non-U.S. taxes: Current 319 386 528 Deferred 164 (3) (563) State taxes: Current 23 (160) 61 Deferred (27) (14) 41 $387 $(629) $(2,314) HP Inc. and Subsidiaries In fiscal year 2019, HP recorded $1.3 billion of net income tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes. This amount includes  tax benefits related to audit settlements of $1.0 billion, $75 million due to ability to utilize tax attributes, $57 million of restructuring benefits and  net valuation allowance releases of $94 million. HP also recorded benefits of $78 million related to U.S. tax reform as a result of new guidance  issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). These benefits were partially offset by uncertain tax position charges of $51 million. In fiscal  year 2019, in addition to the discrete items mentioned above, HP recorded excess tax benefits of $20 million associated with stock options,  restricted stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units. In fiscal year 2018, HP recorded $2.8 billion of net income tax benefits related to discrete items in the provision for taxes which include impacts  of the TCJA. HP had not yet completed its analysis of the full impact of the TCJA. However, as of October 31, 2018, HP recorded a provisional tax  benefit of $760 million related to $5.6 billion net benefit for the decrease in its deferred tax liability on unremitted foreign earnings, partially  offset by $3.3 billion net expense for the deemed repatriation tax payable in installments over eight years, a $1.2 billion net expense for the  remeasurement of its deferred assets and liabilities to the new U.S. statutory tax rate and a $317 million valuation allowance on net expense  related to deferred tax assets that are expected to be realized at a lower rate. HP also recorded tax benefits related to audit settlements of  $1.5 billion and valuation allowance releases of $601 million pertaining to a change in our ability to utilize certain foreign and U.S. deferred tax  assets due to a change in our geographic earnings mix. These benefits were partially offset by other net tax charges of $34 million. In fiscal year  2018, in addition to the discrete items mentioned above, HP recorded excess tax benefits of $42 million associated with stock options, restricted  stock units and performance-adjusted restricted stock units. As a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain  countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, through 2029. The gross income tax benefits  attributable to these actions and investments were estimated to be $344 million ($0.24 diluted EPS) in fiscal year 2020, $386 million ($0.25  diluted net EPS) in fiscal year 2019 and $578 million ($0.35 diluted net EPS) in fiscal year 2018. As of October 31, 2020, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $820 million, of which up to $657 million would affect HP’s effective tax  rate if realized. As of October 31, 2019, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $929 million of which up to $803 million would affect HP’s  effective tax rate if realized. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $109 million primarily related to the resolution of various  audits. HP recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in the  provision for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, HP had accrued $34 million, $56 million  and $160 million, respectively, for interest and penalties. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP engages in continuous discussions and negotiations with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. HP expects to  complete resolution of certain tax years with various tax authorities within the next 12 months. HP believes it is reasonably possible that its  existing gross unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by up to $107 million within the next 12 months, affecting HP’s effective tax rate if  realized. HP is subject to income tax in the United States and approximately 60 other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits  in many of these jurisdictions. In addition, HP is subject to numerous ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The IRS is  conducting an audit of HP’s 2018 and 2019 income tax returns. With respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, HP is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 2002. No material  tax deficiencies have been assessed in major state or foreign tax jurisdictions related to ongoing audits as of October 31, 2020. The U.S. Tax Court ruled in May 2012 against HP related to certain tax attributes claimed by HP for the tax years 1999 through 2003. HP appealed  the U.S. Tax Court determination by filing a formal Notice of Appeal with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. This case was argued before the Ninth  Circuit in November 2016. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinion in November 2017 affirming the Tax Court determinations. In fiscal  year 2018, HP decided against further appeal. HP believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign  tax audits. HP regularly assesses the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of HP’s tax provision. HP adjusts  its uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events  pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that HP will accurately  predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts  previously included in the Provision for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could  have a material impact on net income or cash flows. HP has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $5.7 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations  as of October 31, 2020 because HP intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. Determination of the amount of  unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. The TCJA taxed HP’s historic earnings and profits of its non-U.S.  subsidiaries. HP will remit these taxed reinvested earnings for which deferred U.S. federal and withholding taxes have been provided where  excess cash has accumulated and HP determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons. 90 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Gross deferred tax assets as of October 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were reduced by valuation allowances of $8.0 billion, $7.9 billion and  $7.9 billion, respectively. In fiscal year 2020, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased by $46 million primarily associated with foreign  net operating losses and U.S. deferred tax assets that are anticipated to be realized at a lower effective rate than the federal statutory tax rate  due to certain future U.S. international tax reform implications. In fiscal year 2019, the deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased by  $24 million primarily associated with the recognition of the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers other than inventory. This increase  was partially offset by the impact of tax rate changes in foreign jurisdictions and state valuation allowance releases. In fiscal year 2018, the  deferred tax asset valuation allowance decreased by $901 million primarily associated with foreign net operating losses and U.S. deferred tax  assets that are anticipated to be realized at a lower effective rate than the federal statutory tax rate due to certain future U.S. international tax  reform implications. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries 92 HP Inc. As of October 31, 2020, HP had recorded deferred tax assets for various tax credit carryforwards as follows: In millions Balance at beginning of year $7,930 $7,906 $8,807 Income tax (benefit) expense 74 (339) (897) Other comprehensive loss (income), currency translation and charges to other accounts (28) 363 (4) Balance at end of year $7,976 $7,930 $7,906 In millions U.S. foreign tax credits $ 35 $ (35) 2030 U.S. R&D and other credits 14 — 2040 Tax credits in state and foreign jurisdictions $ 321 $ (59) 2022 Balance at end of year $ 370 $ (94) In millions Federal $ 291 $ 61 $ (15) 2023 State 2,737 174 (61) 2020 Foreign 26,225 7,378 (7,085) 2022 Balance at end of year $ 29,253 $ 7,613 $ (7,161) HP Inc. and Subsidiaries (1)   Amounts outstanding from third parties reported in Accounts Receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. HP has third-party arrangements, consisting of revolving short-term financing, which provide liquidity to certain partners to facilitate their  working capital requirements. These financing arrangements, which in certain circumstances may contain partial recourse, result in a transfer of  HP’s receivables and risk to the third-party. As these transfers qualify as true sales under the applicable accounting guidance, the receivables are  de-recognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheets upon transfer, and HP receives a payment for the receivables from the third-party within a  mutually agreed upon time period. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the recourse obligation is measured using market data  from the similar transactions and reported as a current liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The recourse obligations as of October 31,  2020 and 2019 were not material. The costs associated with the sales of trade receivables for fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not material. Depreciation expense was $673 million, $623 million and $448 million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, also includes an adjustment of $417 million pursuant to the  termination of the TMA with Hewlett Packard Enterprise. 96 HP Inc. (1)  See Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and Note 17, “Leases” for detailed information. (2)  See Note 6, “Taxes on Earnings” for detailed information. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries As of October 31, 2020, the estimated value of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $4.1 billion. HP expects to  recognize approximately $1.8 billion of the unearned amount in next 12 months and $2.3 billion thereafter. HP has elected the practical expedients and accordingly does not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining  performance obligations if: — the portion of the transaction price that is variable in nature is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation. The remaining performance obligations are subject to change and may be affected by various factors, such as termination of contracts, contract  modifications and adjustment for currency. As of October 31, 2020, deferred contract fulfillment and acquisition costs balances were $65 million and $34 million, respectively, included  in Other Current Assets and Other Non-Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, the  Company amortized $98 million of these costs. As of October 31, 2019, deferred contract fulfillment and acquisition costs balances were $47 million and $30 million, respectively, included in  Other Current Assets and Other Non-Current Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the twelve months ended October 31, 2019, the  Company amortized $108 million of these costs. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, HP’s contract liabilities balances were $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, included in Other Current  Liabilities and Other Non-Current Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The increase in the contract liabilities balance for fiscal year 2020 was primarily driven by sales of fixed-price support and maintenance services,  partially offset by $1.1 billion of revenue recognized that were included in the opening contract liabilities balance as of October 31, 2019. As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, HP’s contract liabilities balances were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, included in Other Current  Liabilities and Other Non-Current Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The increase in the contract liabilities balance for fiscal year 2019 was primarily driven by sales of fixed-price support and maintenance services,  partially offset by $0.9 billion of revenue recognized that were included in the opening contract liabilities balance as of October 31, 2018. Note 7: Supplementary Financial Information (Continued) HP Inc. and Subsidiaries (1)  Goodwill is net of accumulated impairment losses of $0.8 billion related to Corporate Investments. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2020, our reporting units are consistent with the reportable  segments identified in Note 2, “Segment Information”. There were no goodwill impairments in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018. Personal  Systems had a negative carrying amount of net assets as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, primarily as a result of a favorable cash  conversion cycle. 98 HP Inc. As of October 31, 2020, estimated future amortization expense related to intangible assets was as follows: HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Note 9: Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date. HP uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data such  as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the  best information available about the assumptions market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy  based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement: Level 1—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2—Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that  are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs. Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The following table presents HP’s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: (1)  Government debt includes instruments such as U.S. treasury notes, U.S. agency securities and non-U.S. government bonds. Money market funds invested in  government debt and traded in active markets are included in Level 1. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Cash Equivalents and Investments: HP holds time deposits, money market funds, mutual funds, other debt securities primarily consisting of  corporate and foreign government notes and bonds, and common stock and equivalents. HP values cash equivalents and equity investments  using quoted market prices, alternative pricing sources, including net asset value, or models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value  of debt investments was based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs primarily derived from or corroborated by  observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable  market data. Derivative Instruments: From time to time, HP uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps, treasury rate locks and, at times,  option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and return on certain investment exposures. HP uses industry standard valuation  models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using  market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves, HP and counterparty credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot  prices for currencies and interest rates. See Note 10, “Financial Instruments” for a further discussion of HP’s use of derivative instruments. Short- and Long-Term Debt: HP estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an expected present value technique, which is based on  observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining  maturities and considering its own credit risk. The portion of HP’s debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an  amount equal to the debt’s carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the fair value of the hedged debt obligations  arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. The fair value of HP’s short- and long-term debt was $6.7 billion at October 31, 2020  compared to its carrying amount of $6.2 billion at that date. The fair value of HP’s short- and long-term debt was $5.4 billion as compared to its  carrying value of $5.1 billion at October 31, 2019. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short- and long-term debt would  be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Other Financial Instruments: For the balance of HP’s financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities  included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities.  If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these other financial instruments would be classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair  value hierarchy. Non-Marketable Equity Investments and Non-Financial Assets: HP’s non-marketable equity investments are measured at cost less impairment,  adjusted for observable price changes. HP’s non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and property, plant and equipment, are  recorded at fair value in the period an impairment charge is recognized. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets these would  generally be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 100 HP Inc. Non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies are included in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These amounted to $44 million and $46 million as of October 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries (1)  HP classifies its marketable debt securities as available-for-sale investments within Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, including those  with maturity dates beyond one year, based on their highly liquid nature and availability for use in current operations. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. As of  October 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest  income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt securities was approximately $40 million in fiscal year 2020, $80 million in fiscal year 2019,  and $116 million in fiscal year 2018. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of values that will  be realized in the future. HP uses derivatives to offset business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows and on certain existing  assets and liabilities. As part of its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps,  total return swaps, treasury rate locks and, at times, option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, return on certain  investment exposures. HP may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges and classifies the cash flows with the  activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items. Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, HP categorizes  those economic hedges as other derivatives. HP recognizes all derivative instruments at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries As a result of its use of derivative instruments, HP is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations.  Master netting agreements mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting HP to net amounts due from HP to counterparty against  amounts due to HP from the same counterparty under certain conditions. To further limit credit risk, HP has collateral security agreements that  allow HP’s custodian to hold collateral from, or require HP to post collateral to, counterparties when aggregate derivative fair values exceed  contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of HP and its counterparties. If HP’s or the counterparty’s  credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, either party has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives’ net liability position.  The fair value of derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $90 million and $45 million as of October 31, 2020 and  2019, respectively, all of which were fully collateralized within two business days. Under HP’s derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting HP  that results in the surviving entity being rated below a specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect HP’s financial position  or cash flows as of October 31, 2020 and 2019. HP enters into fair value hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from  changes in benchmark interest rates on HP’s future interest rate payments. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative  instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of  Earnings in the period of change. During the fiscal year 2020, HP terminated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $0.5 billion that were de-designated as fair value  hedges of certain fixed rate debt securities that were extinguished. HP also entered into $0.6 billion notional amount interest rate swaps  designated as fair value hedges to convert a portion of newly issued $1.15 billion fixed-rate debt to floating. HP uses forward contracts, treasury rate locks, and at times, option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign  currency exchange and interest rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and debt issuance.  HP’s foreign currency cash flow hedges mature predominantly within twelve months; however, hedges related to long-term procurement  arrangements extend several years. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, HP initially records changes in fair value of the derivative  instrument in Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and  subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. HP reports the  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in the same financial statement line item as changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In March 2020, HP entered into a series of treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $750 million to hedge the exposure to  variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in interest rate related to an anticipated issuance of long-term debt. These agreements  were designated as cash flow hedges and were settled upon issuance of the senior notes in June 2020 resulting in an immaterial loss recognized  in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). The loss will be reclassified to Interest and other, net over the life of the related debt. 102 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency-denominated  balance sheet exposures. HP uses total return swaps to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan liability. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, HP recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as  the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period  of change. For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged  item with the change in fair value of the derivative. For foreign currency options and forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges, HP  measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of  the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, no portion of the hedging instruments’ gain or loss was excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for fair  value and cash flow hedges. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP recognizes all derivative instruments on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. HP does not offset the fair value of its derivative  instruments against the fair value of cash collateral posted under its collateral security agreements. As of October 31, 2020 and 2019,  information related to the potential effect of HP’s master netting agreements and collateral security agreements was as follows: 104 HP Inc. (1)  Represents the cash collateral posted by counterparties as of the respective reporting date for HP’s asset position, net of derivative amounts that could be  offset, as of, generally, two business days prior to the respective reporting date. (2)  Represents the collateral posted by HP through re-use of counterparty cash collateral as of the respective reporting date for HP’s liability position, net of  derivative amounts that could be offset, as of, generally, two business days prior to the respective reporting date. As of October 31, 2020, HP expects to reclassify an estimated Accumulated other comprehensive loss of approximately $57 million, net of  taxes, to earnings within the next twelve months associated with cash flow hedges along with the earnings effects of the related forecasted  transactions. The amounts ultimately reclassified into earnings could be different from the amounts previously included in Accumulated other  comprehensive loss based on the change of market rate, and therefore could have different impact on earnings.

HP incurred $26 million  towards issuance costs. HP will pay interest semi-annually on the notes on June 17 and December 17, beginning December 17, 2020. HP had  entered into treasury rate lock agreements with notional amounts totaling $750 million to hedge exposure to variability in future cash flows  resulting from changes in interest rates related to the forecasted issuance of long-term debt. These agreements were settled upon issuance of  the senior notes in June 2020. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund approximately $0.7 billion and $0.9 billion for the cash  tender offer (“Tender Offer”) and the redemption, respectively, of certain existing notes, as described below. Net proceeds from this offering in  excess of the amounts used to repurchase the notes were used for general corporate purposes. As disclosed in Note 10, “Financial Instruments”, HP uses interest rate swaps to mitigate some of the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes  in fair value resulting from changes in benchmark interest rates. Interest rates shown in the table of long-term debt have not been adjusted to  reflect the impact of any interest rate swaps. 106 HP Inc.

This extinguishment of debt resulted in a net loss of $23 million, which  was recorded as Interest and other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. On July 22, 2020, HP redeemed the remaining aggregate principal amounts of $0.5 billion in outstanding U.S. Dollar 3.750% Global Notes due  December 1, 2020 and $0.4 billion in outstanding U.S. Dollar 4.300% Global Notes due June 1, 2021. This extinguishment of debt resulted in a  net loss of $17 million, which was recorded as Interest and other, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As part of the above transactions, HP terminated and settled interest rate swaps with a notional of $0.5 billion that were de-designated as fair  value hedges. As of October 31, 2020, HP maintained two commercial paper programs. HP’s U.S. program provides for the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated  commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $6.0 billion. HP’s euro commercial paper program provides for the issuance of  commercial paper outside of the United States denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount  of $6.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under  those programs at any one time cannot exceed the $6.0 billion authorized by HP’s Board of Directors. As of October 31, 2020, HP maintained a $4.0 billion senior unsecured committed revolving credit facility to support the issuance of commercial  paper or for general corporate purposes. Commitments under the revolving credit facility will be available until March 30, 2023. Commitment  fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facilities vary based on HP’s external credit ratings. On May 29, 2020, we entered into a 364-day revolving credit facility providing for a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate  lending commitments of $1.0 billion. Commitments under the 364-day revolving credit facility will be available until May 28, 2021. Funds  borrowed under this revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2020, HP was in compliance with the financial covenants in the credit agreements governing the revolving credit facilities. Available Borrowing Resources As of October 31, 2020, HP had available borrowing resources of $725 million from uncommitted lines of credit in addition to the senior  unsecured committed revolving credit facilities. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP’s share repurchase program authorizes both open market and private repurchase transactions. In fiscal year 2020, HP executed share  repurchases of 168 million shares and settled total shares for $3.1 billion. In fiscal year 2019, HP executed share repurchases of 118 million  shares and settled total shares for $2.4 billion. In fiscal year 2018, HP executed share repurchases of 111 million shares and settled total shares  for $2.6 billion. Share repurchases executed during fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 included 2.3 million shares, 0.9 million shares, and  1.0 million shares settled in November 2020, November 2019, and November 2018, respectively. The shares repurchased in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were all open market repurchase transactions. On February 22, 2020, HP’s Board  of Directors increased HP’s share repurchase authorization to $15.0 billion in total. As of October 31, 2020, HP had approximately $12.7 billion  remaining under the share repurchase authorizations approved by HP’s Board of Directors. On February 20, 2020, HP’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right  for each outstanding share of HP’s common stock to shareholders of record on March 2, 2020. The dividend distribution was made on March 2,  2020. The rights were set to expire on February 20, 2021, unless terminated earlier by HP’s Board of Directors. The Board of Directors terminated  the shareholder rights plan, effective June 25, 2020, and at the time of the termination, all rights distributed to holders of HP’s common stock  under the shareholder rights plan expired. 108 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries The components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes as of October 31, 2020 and changes during fiscal year 2020 were  as follows: (1)  These components are included in the computation of net pension and post-retirement benefit (credit) charges in Note 4, “Retirement and Post-Retirement  Benefit Plans”. (1)  HP excludes from the calculation of diluted net EPS stock options and restricted stock units where the assumed proceeds exceed the average market  price, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. The assumed proceeds of a stock option include the sum of its exercise price, and average unrecognized  compensation cost. The assumed proceeds of a restricted stock unit represent unrecognized compensation cost. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries HP calculates basic net EPS using net earnings and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted  net EPS includes any dilutive effect of restricted stock units, stock options, performance-based awards and shares purchased under the 2011  employee stock purchase plan. HP is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of IP, commercial, securities,  employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP accrues a liability when  management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. HP believes it  has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2020, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been  incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in HP’s financial statements. HP reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts its accruals to  reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.  Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, HP shares responsibility with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain matters, as indicated  below, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise has agreed to indemnify HP in whole or in part with respect to certain matters. Based on its experience,  HP believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of HP’s potential liability.  Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, HP believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Nevertheless,  cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. Copyright Levies. Proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving HP in certain European countries, including litigation in Belgium and  other countries, seeking to impose or modify levies upon IT equipment (such as multifunction devices (“MFDs”) and PCs), alleging that these  devices enable the production of private copies of copyrighted materials. The levies are generally based upon the number of products sold  and the per-product amounts of the levies, which vary. Some European countries that do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to  implement similar legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes, while other European countries have phased out levies or are 110 HP Inc.

HP, other companies and various industry associations have opposed the extension of levies to the digital environment and have advocated  alternative models of compensation to rights holders. Reprobel SCRL (“Reprobel”), a collecting society administering the remuneration for reprography to Belgian copyright holders, requested  by extrajudicial means that HP amend certain copyright levy declarations submitted for inkjet MFDs sold in Belgium from January 2005 to  December 2009 to enable it to collect copyright levies calculated based on the generally higher copying speed when the MFDs are operated  in draft print mode rather than when operated in normal print mode. In March 2010, HP filed a lawsuit against Reprobel in the Brussels Court  of First Instance in Belgium, seeking a declaratory judgment that no copyright levies are payable on sales of MFDs in Belgium or, alternatively,  that payments already made by HP are sufficient to comply with its obligations. The Brussels Court of Appeal (the “Court of Appeal”) stayed the  proceedings and referred several questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”). On November 12, 2015, the CJEU published  its judgment providing that a national legislation such as the Belgian one at issue in the main proceedings is incompatible with EU law on multiple  legal points, as argued by HP, and returned the proceedings to the referring court. On May 12, 2017, the Court of Appeal held that (1) reprographic  copyright levies are due notwithstanding the lack of conformity of the Belgian system with EU law in certain aspects and (2) the applicable levies  are to be calculated based on the objective speed of each MFD as established by an expert appointed by the Court of Appeal. HP appealed this  decision before the Belgian Supreme Court on January 18, 2018. The Belgian Supreme Court rejected HP’s appeal on September 24, 2020 and the  matter has been remitted to the Court of Appeal, where the expert will give an opinion on the objective speed and amount of compensation due. Based on industry opposition to the extension of levies to digital products, HP’s assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HP’s  estimates of the number of units impacted and the amounts of the levies, HP has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the  ongoing disputes. Hewlett-Packard Company v. Oracle Corporation. On June 15, 2011, HP filed suit against Oracle Corporation (“Oracle”) in California Superior Court  in Santa Clara County in connection with Oracle’s March 2011 announcement that it was discontinuing software support for HP’s Itanium-based  line of mission-critical servers. HP asserted, among other things, that Oracle’s actions breached the contract that was signed by the parties as  part of the settlement of the litigation relating to Oracle’s hiring of Mark Hurd. The matter eventually progressed to trial, which was bifurcated  into two phases. HP prevailed in the first phase of the trial, in which the court ruled that the contract at issue required Oracle to continue to  offer its software products on HP’s Itanium-based servers for as long as HP decided to sell such servers. The second phase of the trial was then  postponed by Oracle’s appeal of the trial court’s denial of Oracle’s “anti-SLAPP” motion, in which Oracle argued that HP’s damages claim infringed  on Oracle’s First Amendment rights. On August 27, 2015, the California Court of Appeals rejected Oracle’s appeal. The matter was remanded  to the trial court for the second phase of the trial, which began on May 23, 2016 and was submitted to the jury on June 29, 2016. On June 30,  2016, the jury returned a verdict in favor of HP, awarding HP approximately $3.0 billion in damages, which included approximately $1.7 billion  for past lost profits and $1.3 billion for future lost profits. On October 20, 2016, the court entered judgment for HP for this amount with interest  accruing until the judgment is paid. Oracle’s motion for new trial was denied on December 19, 2016, and Oracle filed its notice of appeal from  the trial court’s judgment on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of cross-appeal challenging the trial court’s denial of  prejudgment interest. The case is fully briefed and awaiting the Court of Appeals to schedule oral argument. HP expects that the appeals process  could take several years to complete. Litigation is unpredictable, and there can be no assurance that HP will recover damages, or that any award  of damages will be for the amount awarded by the jury’s verdict. The amount ultimately awarded, if any, would be recorded in the period received.  No adjustment has been recorded in the financial statements in relation to this potential award. Pursuant to the terms of the separation and  distribution agreement, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise will share equally in any recovery from Oracle once Hewlett Packard Enterprise has  been reimbursed for all costs incurred in the prosecution of the action prior to the Separation. Forsyth, et al. v. HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. This is a purported class and collective action filed on August 18, 2016 in the United  States District Court, Northern District of California, against HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise alleging the defendants violated the Federal Age  Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”), the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, California public policy and the California Business  and Professions Code by terminating older workers and replacing them with younger workers. The operative complaint is the Fourth Amended  Complaint, filed on July 9, 2020. Thirty-five named and opt-in plaintiffs remain. By their complaint, plaintiffs seek to represent (1) a putative  nationwide ADEA collective comprised of all individuals 40 years of age and older who had their employment terminated pursuant to a WFR  plan on or after December 9, 2014 or April 8, 2015, depending on state law; and (2) a putative Rule 23 class under California law comprised HP Inc. and Subsidiaries of all individuals 40 years of age and older who had their employment terminated in California pursuant to a WFR plan on or after August 18,  2012. Excluded from the putative collective and class are employees who (a) signed a Waiver and General Release Agreement at termination, or  (b) signed an Agreement to Arbitrate Claims. A similar purported collective and class are proposed for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, but the time  periods start on November 1, 2015. Plaintiffs seek monetary damages in the form of back and front pay and benefits, liquidated damages under  the ADEA, punitive damages under the state law claims, an award of attorneys’ fees, and other relief. On August 24, 2020, defendants filed a  motion to dismiss or strike allegations from the operative complaint, which the court denied on October 15, 2020. Defendants filed their answers  on October 29, 2020. India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings. On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (the “DRI”)  issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Limited (“HP India”), a subsidiary of HP, seven HP India employees and one  former HP India employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking  to recover an aggregate of approximately $370 million, plus penalties. Prior to the issuance of the show cause notices, HP India deposited  approximately $16 million with the DRI and agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRI’s agreement to not seize HP India products  and spare parts and to not interrupt the transaction of business by HP India. On April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related show cause notice affirming certain duties  and penalties against HP India and the named individuals of approximately $386 million, of which HP India had already deposited $9 million. On  December 11, 2012, HP India voluntarily deposited an additional $10 million in connection with the products-related show cause notice. The  differential duty demand is subject to interest. On April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the parts-related show cause notice  affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and certain of the named individuals of approximately $17 million, of which HP India had  already deposited $7 million. After the order, HP India deposited an additional $3 million in connection with the parts-related show cause notice  so as to avoid certain penalties. HP India filed appeals of the Commissioner’s orders before the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (the “Customs Tribunal”)  along with applications for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for hearing the appeals. The Customs  Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On January 24, 2013, the Customs Tribunal ordered HP India to deposit  an additional $24 million against the products order, which HP India deposited in March 2013. The Customs Tribunal did not order any additional  deposit to be made under the parts order. In December 2013, HP India filed applications before the Customs Tribunal seeking early hearing of  the appeals as well as an extension of the stay of deposit as to HP India and the individuals already granted until final disposition of the appeals.  On February 7, 2014, the application for extension of the stay of deposit was granted by the Customs Tribunal until disposal of the appeals.  On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner’s orders. The Customs Tribunal  rejected HP India’s request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings scheduled to reconvene on April 6,  2015 and again on November 3, 2015 and April 11, 2016 were canceled at the request of the Customs Tribunal. A hearing on the merits of the  appeal scheduled for January 15, 2019 has been cancelled. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise  has agreed to indemnify HP in part, based on the extent to which any liability arises from the products and spare parts of Hewlett Packard  Enterprise’s businesses. Neodron Patent Litigation. United States. On May 21, 2019, Neodron Ltd. (“Neodron”) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Hewlett  Packard Enterprise in U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. On the same day, Neodron filed a companion complaint with the U.S.  International Trade Commission (“ITC”) pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against seven sets of respondents, including Hewlett  Packard Enterprise. On May 23 and June 14, 2019, Neodron filed amended complaints in the ITC and the Western District of Texas, respectively,  to replace Hewlett Packard Enterprise with HP. Both complaints alleged that certain touch-controlled devices infringe four patents owned by  Neodron. On June 19, 2019, the ITC instituted an investigation. In the ITC proceeding, Neodron sought an order enjoining HP from importing,  selling for importation, or selling after importation certain touch-controlled notebook computers and tablets. On June 28, 2019, Neodron filed  a second lawsuit in the Western District of Texas, asserting four additional patents against HP touch-controlled devices. Neodron amended its  complaint in the second lawsuit to assert a total of eight patents against HP touch-controlled devices. Neodron sought unspecified damages and  a permanent injunction, among other remedies. 112 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Germany. On October 29, 2019, Neodron served HP with a claim of patent infringement at the Munich State Court in Germany. The patent  asserted in the German case is related to a patent asserted in the ITC. The initial hearing was held on July 29, 2020. If the German court had found  infringement of a valid patent, the court may have issued an injunction as part of any remedy. Settlement of Litigation. On July 31, 2020, HP and Neodron entered into an agreement to settle all pending litigation between them on a  worldwide basis, and all pending legal actions against one another have been dismissed. Slingshot Printing LLC Litigation. On June 11, 2019, Slingshot Printing LLC (“Slingshot”) filed three complaints in U.S. District Court in the Western  District of Texas alleging HP infringes or has infringed sixteen patents. On September 20, 2019, Slingshot filed a fourth complaint and amended  the three earlier complaints, alleging that HP infringes or has infringed thirty-two patents. On December 12, 2019, Slingshot voluntarily dismissed  its allegations as to one patent because it did not own a related patent. On January 23, 2020, Slingshot filed a fifth complaint, re-asserting the  dismissed patent as well as the related patent. On February 13, 2020, Slingshot voluntarily dismissed its allegations as to another patent, which  was asserted in its third complaint. On March 25, 2020, Slingshot voluntarily dismissed its allegations as to an additional patent, which was also  asserted in its third complaint. Slingshot is currently asserting a total of 31 patents. The accused products include inkjet printers, cartridges, and  printheads. The complaints seek monetary damages. Philips Patent Litigation. On September 17, 2020, Koninklijke Philips N.V. and Philips North America LLC (collectively, “Philips”) filed a complaint  against HP for patent infringement in federal court for the District of Delaware. On September 18, 2020, Philips filed a companion complaint with  the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 against HP and 8 other sets of respondents.  Both the district court complaint and the ITC complaint allege that certain digital video-capable devices and components thereof infringe four of  Philips owned patents. On October 16, 2020, the ITC instituted an investigation. The investigation is in its early stages, and the ITC’s final decision  is due by February 22, 2022. In the ITC proceeding, Philips seeks an order enjoining respondents from importing, or selling after importation,  certain digital video-capable devices and components thereof, including certain PCs, display devices, and components thereof. In the district court  action, Philips seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against HP, among other remedies. Caltech Patent Litigation. On November 11, 2020, the California Institute of Technology (“Caltech”) filed a complaint against HP for patent  infringement in the federal court for the Western District of Texas. The complaint alleges infringement of three of Caltech’s patents, U.S. Patent  Nos. 7,116,710, 7,421,032 and 7,916,781. The accused products are HP commercial and consumer PCs that comply with the IEEE 802.11n,  802.11ac, and/or 802.11ax standards. Caltech seeks unspecified damages and other relief. In re HP Inc. Securities Litigation (Electrical Workers Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. v. HP Inc., et al.). On February 19, 2020, Electrical Workers  Pension Fund, Local 103, I.B.E.W. filed a putative class action complaint against HP, Dion Weisler, Catherine Lesjak, and Steven Fieler in U.S. District  Court in the Northern District of California. On May 20, 2020, the court appointed the State of Rhode Island, Office of the General Treasurer, on  behalf of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island and Iron Workers Local 580 Joint Funds as Lead Plaintiffs. On July 20, 2020, Lead  Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which additionally names as defendants Enrique Lores and Christoph Schell. The amended complaint  alleges, among other things, that from February 23, 2017 to October 3, 2019, HP and the named officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the  Exchange Act by making false or misleading statements about HP’s printing supplies business, including HP’s use of its four-box model to predict  the demand for supplies. It further alleges that Dion Weisler and Enrique Lores violated Sections 10(b) and 20A of the Exchange Act by allegedly  selling shares of HP common stock during this period while in possession of material, non-public adverse information about HP’s print business.  Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages and other relief. On October 2, 2020, HP and the named officers filed a motion to dismiss the complaint  for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. That motion is due to be fully briefed in early 2021. York County on behalf of the County of York Retirement Fund v. HP Inc., et al. On November 5, 2020, York County, on behalf of the County of York  Retirement Fund, filed a putative class action complaint against HP, Dion Weisler, and Catherine Lesjak in federal court in the Northern District of  California. The complaint alleges, among other things, that from November 6, 2015 to June 21, 2016, HP and the named former officers violated  Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by concealing material information and making false statements about HP’s printing supplies  business, including information about HP’s channel inventory management and sales practices. Plaintiff seeks compensatory damages and  other relief. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Legal Proceedings re Authentication of Supplies. Civil litigation or government investigations are pending in the United States, Italy, Israel, and the  Netherlands involving supplies authentication protocols used in certain HP printers. These protocols are often referred to as Dynamic Security.  The core allegations in these proceedings claim misleading or inadequate consumer notifications and permissions pertaining to the use of  Dynamic Security, the impact of firmware updates, or the potential inability of cartridges with clone chips or circuitry to work in HP printers with  Dynamic Security. 123Inkt Foundation litigation (Netherlands). On November 23, 2016, a foundation known as Stichting 123Inkt-Huismerk Klanten (the  “Foundation”) filed a complaint in district court in Amsterdam against HP Nederland B.V. and HP Inc. arising out of the use of Dynamic Security  in certain OfficeJet printers. Digital Revolution B.V. (a.k.a. 123Inkt) established the Foundation to pursue the interests of approximately 960  of its customers who transferred their claims to it. The complaint alleges: (1) violation of right of ownership; (2) destruction and damage to  property; (3) computer vandalism; (4) unlawful act; (5) non-compliance; (6) unfair commercial practices; (7) misleading commercial practices;  and (8) misleading advertising. The complaint seeks injunctive relief to prohibit use of Dynamic Security, damages, and attorneys’ fees. On  December 27, 2017, the District Court dismissed the case and awarded fees to HP. On January 25, 2018, the Foundation filed a summons with  the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to appeal. On December 17, 2019, the Court of Appeal set aside the judgment of the District Court, adopted  a new decision declaring that HP provided inadequate and partially incorrect information to the Foundation members around September 13,  2016, awarded damages to them in an amount to be later determined, but denied all other claims, including injunctive relief, holding that the  use of Dynamic Security is not inherently impermissible and the Foundation lacks legal interest to pursue such action. On March 19, 2020, the  Foundation filed a cassation writ of summons with the Supreme Court of the Netherlands (Hoge Raad der Nederlanden) appealing the decision of  the Court of Appeal. On May 29, 2020, HP filed its statement of defense and incidental appeal in cassation with the Supreme Court appealing the  decision of the Court of Appeal. On October 30, 2020, the parties filed their opening briefs with the Supreme Court. Gensin v. HP Inc. (Israel). On October 25, 2017, a purported consumer class action, captioned Gensin v. HP Inc., was filed in the District Court in  Jerusalem against HP arising out of the use of Dynamic Security in certain OfficeJet printers. The petition and motion for certification as a class  action alleges: (1) tortious wrongdoing in violation of the Computers Law, 5755-1995; (2) breach of Contracts Law, 5731-1970; (3) breach of  the Consumer Protection Law, 5741-1981; (4) negligence; and (5) improper enrichment. The named petitioner initially sought to represent  nationwide classes comprised of anyone who “owns an HP printer that has been blocked, disrupted, or interfered with by HP in the use of ink  cartridges not manufactured by HP” or who “purchased ink cartridges not manufactured by HP for use in the blocked printers.” Plaintiff seeks  class relief, injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys’ fees. On November 16, 2017, a second purported consumer class action was filed against  HP in the Central District Court, captioned Dror v. HP, Inc., also arising out of the use of Dynamic Security in certain OfficeJet printers. The petition  and motion allege similar causes of action on behalf of similar nationwide classes. After the Dror case was consolidated with the Gensin case  in Jerusalem, the District Court on June 24, 2018 dismissed the Dror case and designated Gensin as the lead matter. On March 9, 2020, the  petitioner moved to modify the proposed nationwide class to be comprised of “[a]ll persons who have an HP printer and whose printer was  blocked or rendered unusable by HP with any ink cartridge that is not made by HP” and “[a]ll persons who purchased ink cartridges that are not  made by HP, for use in the Blocked Printers.” On July 2, 2020, HP filed its response to the amended petition. Parziale v. HP Inc. (United States). On August 27, 2019, a purported consumer class action was filed against HP in federal court in the Northern  District of California arising out of the use of Dynamic Security in certain OfficeJet printers. The complaint alleges two causes of action under  Florida Consumer Protection statutes: (1) violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, F.S.A. §§ 501.201 et seq., and  (2) violation of the Florida Misleading Advertisement Law, F.S.A. §§ 817.41 et seq. The named plaintiff seeks to represent a nationwide class of  “[a]ll United States Citizens who, between the applicable statute of limitations and the present, had an HP Printer that was modified to reject third  party ink cartridges or refilled HP ink cartridges.” On November 13, 2019, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, adding three causes of action to  the case: (1) violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1030 et seq., (2) trespass to chattels, and (3) tortious interference with  business relations. Plaintiff seeks class relief, injunctive relief, damages, including punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. On December 30, 2019,  HP moved to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint. On April 24, 2020, the Court granted in part and denied in part HP’s motion to dismiss. The  Court dismissed plaintiff’s causes of action under the Florida Consumer Protection statutes, as well as the tortious interference with business  relations claim and four of the five claims under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The Court denied HP’s motion to dismiss on the remaining  claims and on the request for injunctive relief and granted plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint. On June 5, 2020, plaintiff filed a second  amended complaint on behalf of both a nationwide class and a Florida subclass alleging violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade 114 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Practices Act, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and trespass to chattels. Plaintiff sought class relief, injunctive relief, damages,  including punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. On September 29, 2020, the Court granted HP’s motion to dismiss, dismissing the case in full  with prejudice. Plaintiff filed notice of appeal, and its opening brief is due in early 2021. Consumer Protection Investigation (Italy). On September 26, 2019, the Italian Competition Authority (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e  del Mercato) (“AGCM”) served a Notice of Initiation of Proceedings on HP concerning the investigation of alleged aggressive practices involving  undue influence on consumers and alleged misleading actions and omissions regarding the restriction or prevention of the use of third-party  ink cartridges in HP printers, accompanied by a request for information. HP submitted its reply to the AGCM’s request for information on  November 15, 2019 and has addressed subsequent requests for information. On May 22, 2020, the AGCM gave notice that it intended to expand  its investigation into certain alleged warranty practices regarding the use of third-party cartridges. On June 26, 2020, HP submitted its response  to the warranty allegations. On December 7, 2020, the AGCM notified HP of the AGCM’s final decision finding that HP engaged in two unfair  commercial practices as follows: (a) the information HP provided to consumers about limitations on the use of certain third-party cartridges in  HP printers was allegedly misleading pursuant to Articles 20, 21 and 22 of the Italian Consumer Code, and (b) the alleged use of data to deny  warranty coverage and certain alleged data collection practices were aggressive pursuant to Articles 20, 24 and 25 of the Italian Consumer Code.  The final decision (i) orders HP to end the allegedly unfair commercial practices; (ii) fines HP €5 million for each alleged unfair practice (total  €10 million); (iii) requires HP to file a compliance report within 60 days; (iv) orders HP to publicly publish a corrective statement within 120 days;  and (v) orders HP to amend the packaging of its printers within 120 days. The fines are payable within 30 days. HP has 60 days to appeal and  intends to appeal. Digital Revolution B.V. v. HP Nederland B.V., et al. (Netherlands). On March 30, 2020, Digital Revolution B.V. (a.k.a. 123Inkt) served a complaint  filed in Amsterdam District Court arising out of the use of Dynamic Security in certain HP printers. The complaint alleges several causes of  action: (1) abuse of dominant position; (2) misleading advertising; (3) unfair and misleading commercial practice; and (4) misleading comparative  advertising. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, including prohibition of Dynamic Security and disclosure of cartridge authentication protocols,  damages, and attorneys’ fees. The parties’ initial appearance in front of the Court took place on July 8, 2020. On September 9, 2020, HP filed its  defense and a counterclaim for unfair commercial practices and misleading and unlawful comparative advertising against Digital Revolution B.V. SEC Investigation. In 2017, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents regarding HP’s printing supplies business for  the time period before June 2016, with a primary focus on the APJ region. HP fully cooperated with the SEC in connection with its investigation.  On September 30, 2020, HP settled with the SEC and entered into an administrative resolution that included findings by the SEC that HP violated  Sections 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules thereunder,  by failing to disclose certain known trends and uncertainties regarding supplies sales practices and their impact on margin and supplies channel  inventory, and that it provided incomplete disclosures regarding supplies channel inventory in its SEC filings and related earnings calls from  November 2015 through June 2016. The SEC order imposed a civil penalty of $6 million. HP neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings. Investigations. As a result of the findings of an ongoing investigation, HP has provided information to the U.K. Serious Fraud Office, the U.S.  Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the SEC related to the accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and misrepresentations at Autonomy  that occurred prior to and in connection with HP’s acquisition of Autonomy. On January 19, 2015, the U.K. Serious Fraud Office notified HP  that it was closing its investigation and had decided to cede jurisdiction of the investigation to the U.S. authorities. On November 14, 2016, the  DOJ announced that a federal grand jury indicted Sushovan Hussain, the former CFO of Autonomy. Hussain was charged with conspiracy  to commit wire fraud, securities fraud, and multiple counts of wire fraud. The indictment alleged that Mr. Hussain engaged in a scheme to  defraud purchasers and sellers of securities of Autonomy and HP about the true performance of Autonomy’s business, its financial condition,  and its prospects for growth. A jury trial commenced on February 26, 2018. On April 30, 2018, the jury found Mr. Hussain guilty of all charges  against him. On August 26, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment of conviction against Mr. Hussain. On  November 15, 2016, the SEC announced that Stouffer Egan, the former CEO of Autonomy’s U.S.-based operations, settled charges relating  to his participation in an accounting scheme to meet internal sales targets and analyst revenue expectations. On November 29, 2018, the HP Inc. and Subsidiaries DOJ announced that a federal grand jury indicted Michael Lynch, former CEO of Autonomy, and Stephen Chamberlain, former VP of Finance of  Autonomy. Lynch and Mr. Chamberlain were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and multiple counts of wire fraud. HP is continuing  to cooperate with the ongoing enforcement actions. Autonomy Corporation Limited v. Michael Lynch and Sushovan Hussain. On April 17, 2015, four former HP subsidiaries that became subsidiaries  of Hewlett Packard Enterprise at the time of the Separation (Autonomy Corporation Limited, Hewlett Packard Vision BV, Autonomy Systems,  Limited, and Autonomy, Inc.) initiated civil proceedings in the U.K. High Court of Justice against two members of Autonomy’s former management,  Michael Lynch and Sushovan Hussain. The Particulars of Claim seek damages in excess of $5 billion from Messrs. Lynch and Hussain for breach of  their fiduciary duties by causing Autonomy group companies to engage in improper transactions and accounting practices. On October 1, 2015,  Messrs. Lynch and Hussain filed their defenses. Lynch also filed a counterclaim against Autonomy Corporation Limited seeking $160 million in  damages, among other things, for alleged misstatements regarding Lynch. The Hewlett Packard Enterprise subsidiary claimants filed their replies  to the defenses and the asserted counter-claim on March 11, 2016. Trial began on March 25, 2019 and was completed in January 2020. The  parties are awaiting a ruling from the Court. HP’s business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely  affect our business and results of operations. For example, HP is subject to laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including  laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the  clean-up of contaminated sites, the content of HP’s products and the recycling, treatment and disposal of those products, including batteries. In  particular, HP faces increasing complexity in its product design and procurement operations as it adjusts to new and future requirements relating  to the chemical and materials composition of its products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate  change laws and regulations, and product repairability, reuse and take-back legislation. HP could incur substantial costs, its products could be  restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or  if its products become noncompliant with environmental laws. HP’s potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party  property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult  to predict. HP is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental  Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), known as “Superfund,” or state laws similar to CERCLA, and may become a party to, or  otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties for contribution towards clean-up costs. HP is also conducting environmental  investigations or remediations at several current or former operating sites pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with state  environmental agencies. The separation and distribution agreement between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise includes provisions that provide for the allocation of  environmental liabilities including certain remediation obligations; responsibilities arising from the chemical and materials composition of their  respective products, their safe use and their energy consumption; obligations under product take back legislation that addresses the collection,  recycling, treatment and disposal of products; and other environmental matters. HP will generally be responsible for environmental liabilities  related to the properties and other assets, including products, allocated to HP under the separation and distribution agreement and other  ancillary agreements. Under these agreements, HP will indemnify Hewlett Packard Enterprise for liabilities for specified ongoing remediation  projects, subject to certain limitations, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise has a payment obligation for a specified portion of the cost of those  remediation projects. In addition, HP will share with Hewlett Packard Enterprise other environmental liabilities as set forth in the separation and  distribution agreement. HP is indemnified in whole or in part by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for liabilities arising from the assets assigned to  Hewlett Packard Enterprise and for certain environmental matters as detailed in the separation and distribution agreement. 116 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries In the ordinary course of business, HP may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers and other parties pursuant to which  HP has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety  bonds. In general, HP would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by  the guarantee. HP believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is remote. Under the separation and distribution agreement, HP agreed to indemnify Hewlett Packard Enterprise, each of its subsidiaries and each of their  respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters,  the liabilities allocated to HP as part of the Separation. Hewlett Packard Enterprise similarly agreed to indemnify HP, each of its subsidiaries and  each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other  matters, the liabilities allocated to Hewlett Packard Enterprise as part of the Separation. HP expects Hewlett Packard Enterprise to fully perform  under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement. For information on cross-indemnifications with Hewlett Packard Enterprise for litigation matters, see Note 14, “Litigation and Contingencies”. In connection with the Separation, HP entered into the Tax Matters Agreement (“TMA”) with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, effective on November 1,  2015. The TMA provided that HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise will share certain pre-Separation income tax liabilities. The TMA was terminated  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify a third party to such  arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined  within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. HP also provides indemnifications  to certain vendors and customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the vendors’ and  customers’ use of HP’s software products and services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss  clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial. HP records tax indemnification receivables from various third parties for certain tax liabilities that HP is jointly and severally liable for, but for  which it is indemnified by those same third parties under existing legal agreements. HP records a tax indemnification payable to various third  parties under these agreements when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be  reasonably estimated. The actual amount that the third parties pay or may be obligated to pay HP could vary depending on the outcome of  certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years. HP accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. HP engages in extensive product quality programs and  processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, contractual warranty terms, repair costs,  product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class  failures outside of HP’s baseline experience, affect the estimated warranty obligation. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries As of October 31, 2020, HP had unconditional purchase obligations of $499 million. These unconditional purchase obligations include  agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on HP and that specify all significant terms, including  fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction.  These unconditional purchase obligations are primarily related to inventory and service support. Unconditional purchase obligations exclude  agreements that are cancelable without penalty. HP determines, at lease inception, whether or not an arrangement contains a lease. A significant portion of the operating lease portfolio  includes real estate leases. Additionally, HP has identified embedded operating leases within certain outsourced supply chain contracts. Leasing  arrangements typically range in terms from 1 to 13 years with varying renewal and termination options. Substantially all of HP’s leases are  considered operating leases. Finance leases, short-term leases and sub-lease income were not material as of October 31, 2020 or for the fiscal  year ended October 31, 2020. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that HP will exercise such options. HP generally  considers the economic life of the ROU assets to be comparable to the useful life of similar owned assets. HP’s leases generally do not provide a  residual guarantee. 118 HP Inc. HP Inc. and Subsidiaries Note 17: Leases  (Continued) Operating leases are included in Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities. Finance leases are included in  Property, plant and equipment, net, Notes payable and short-term borrowings and Long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, HP uses the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the  commencement date of a lease in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the  rate of interest that HP would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. HP uses  the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjusts that rate to approximate a collateralized rate. HP has elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components as a single lease element for its real estate leases and certain  outsourced supply chain contracts in calculating the ROU assets and lease liabilities. Where HP chooses not to combine the lease and non-lease  components, HP allocates contract consideration to the lease and non-lease components based on relative standalone prices. HP reviews the impairment of the ROU assets consistent with the approach applied for other long-lived assets. The components of lease expense are as follows: (1)  Includes the impact of new leases as well as remeasurements and modifications to existing leases. Weighted-average information associated with the measurement of our remaining operating lease liabilities is as follows: All lease expenses, including variable lease costs, are primarily included in Cost of revenue and Selling, general and administrative expenses in the  Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the use of the facilities. Variable lease expense relates primarily to leased real estate utilized for office space and outsourced warehousing. These costs primarily include  adjustments for inflation, payments dependent on a rate or index or usage of asset and common area maintenance charges. These costs are not  included in the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred. The following table presents supplemental information relating to the cash flows arising from lease transactions. Cash payments made from  variable lease costs and short-term leases are not included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities, and, as such, are excluded from the  amounts below: Weighted-average remaining lease term in years 6 Weighted-average discount rate 3.1% HP Inc. and Subsidiaries (1)   Amounts represent the operating lease obligations, net of total sublease income of $130 million. There were no material operating leases that HP had entered into and that were yet to commence as of October 31, 2020. On November 1, 2018, HP completed the acquisition of the Apogee group. This acquisition furthers HP’s plan to disrupt the A3 copier market and  builds on its printing strategy to enhance its A3 and A4 product portfolio; build differentiated solutions and tools to expand its MPS, and invest in  its direct and indirect go-to-market capabilities. Apogee augments HP’s services portfolio in contractual office printing and MPS, where solutions  are increasingly important for SMBs. HP reports the financial results of the above business in the Printing segment. The table below presents the purchase price allocation. 120 HP Inc.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on  Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we  conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)  and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation,  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures  were effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported  within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to HP’s management, including our principal  executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we  conducted an evaluation of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)  under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer  and principal financial officer concluded that there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth  quarter of fiscal year 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We do not believe there has been any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting notwithstanding that most of our  employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor and assess the COVID-19 situation on our internal  controls to address any potential impact on their design and operating effectiveness.

HP has included non-GAAP financial measures in this document to supplement HP’s consolidated financial statements presented on a generally  accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) basis, including non-GAAP net earnings per share, free cash flow and net revenue on a constant currency  basis. Additional information relating to these measures is included in the press release announcing our fiscal 2020 full year and fourth quarter  results. These and the other non-GAAP financial measures that HP uses may have limitations as analytical tools, and these measures should not be  considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of HP’s results as reported under GAAP. The non-GAAP financial information that we provide  also may differ from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. We compensate for the limitations on our use of these non-GAAP  financial measures by relying primarily on our GAAP financial statements and using non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally. We also  provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure below and elsewhere in this document,  and we encourage investors to review those reconciliations carefully.

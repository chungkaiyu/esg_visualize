The company is currently specialized in CMO business operation which is focused  on manufacturing biopharmaceuticals on a contract basis. The company is also engaged in CDO  business by providing services from cell lines to initial clinical trials including cell line development,  processes development, and formulation/analysis methodology. The company’s CRO business  supports the exploration of drug candidate materials, biological stability/toxicity analysis in cell line  development, and homogeneity verification and cell storage. The company seeks to become a One- Stop, End-to-End Service Provider through these three business areas. In addition, the company’s  subsidiary, Samsung Bioepis is a biopharmaceuticals research & development firm that is working on  the development and commercialization of biosimilars, and the company has established a subsidiary  Samsung Biologics America, Inc. in the United States for stable CDO business orders and overseas  base expansion.    A. Industry status    (1) Characteristics of business    (A) Industry trends  The bio contract manufacturing organization (CMO) business is for global pharmaceutical companies  that either lack its own production capability or strategically outsource its production to mainly focus  on drug R&D and marketing. Bio-pharmaceutical products are expected to lead the growth in the  overall pharmaceutical market with its high growth rate of 10.5%(Evaluate Pharma, Jan 2021), and  the utilization of CMO by pharmaceutical companies is increasing along with the rapid growth of the  bio-pharmaceutical market. The CMO business operation requires competitive manufacturing cost,  speed in production and supply, and a stable capability to win contracts based on essential quality  control capabilities in the drug manufacturing processes.  Antibody medication, which is SBL’s field of focus, requires a large investment in commercial plant  construction and is characterized by a project that takes at least three years to prepare for  commercialization such as plant design, construction, and validation. In addition, antibody medication  requires a high level of quality control capability that conforms to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)  throughout the entire production processes including cell culture, purification, and filling which all use  animal cells. Additionally, it generally takes more than two years for pharmaceutical companies to  prepare for the production of commercial bio-pharmaceuticals through CMOs after technology transfer,  test production, diverse national pharmaceutical regulatory GMP, and others. Hence, CMO contracts  with pharmaceutical companies are usually based on 5 ~ 10-year long-term contracts. Business Overview (A) Growth factor of market  Growth factors of the biopharmaceutical CMO market are as follows:     1) Continued development of blockbuster biopharmaceuticals  Blockbuster biopharmaceuticals released around the year 2000 (immunosuppressant drugs, anticancer  drugs, antidiabetic drugs, etc.) still show a high level of sales growth, and new promising antibody drugs  for hyperlipidemia, Alzheimer’s disease, and atopic dermatitis along with immune checkpoint inhibitors  continue to be released.    2) Expansion of production outsourcing by global manufacturing companies  Pharmaceutical companies are expanding the areas of production outsourcing to specialized CMOs  where massive capital investments are required to minimize the uncertainty in marketing authorization  and sales forecasting of drugs. This market change gives a new opportunity to CMOs.    3) Increasing demand for dual sourcing to secure supply stability  Recently, regulatory authorities across the world have strongly recommended pharmaceutical  companies to secure a source for stable drug production. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  requested pharmaceutical companies to establish a contingency plan, believing that supply stability  cannot be guaranteed in case the drug is manufactured in a single site. Accordingly, pharmaceutical  companies are making use of CMOs to run multiple manufacturers for a single drug.      4) Drug patent expiration to boost biosimilars market  The biosimilars market is expected to continue enjoying massive growth as most blockbuster biosimilar  drugs such as Humira, Herceptin, Remicade, and Lantus are coming off patent. In this way, the  biosimilar market expansion is expected to further accelerate an increase in demand for overall  biopharmaceutical production.    (B) Market size and forecast  In 2020, the global biopharmaceutical market is valued at USD 285.1 billion, which accounts for 30.1%  of the entire pharmaceutical market. The market is expected to increase with an average growth rate of  10.5% and reach USD 481.3 billion by 2025, which accounts for 35.7% of the global pharmaceutical  market (EvaluatePharma, Jan 2021).  The global bio-CDMO market is valued at USD 13.3 billion in 2020 and is forecasted to reach USD 25.3  billion by 2025 at an average growth rate of 13.7% for the next five years. (Frost & Sullivan, Oct 2019) (3) Characteristics of economic fluctuation  - Not applicable    (4) Competition status  The Company runs a bio-CMO business specialized in manufacturing mammalian cell-based antibody  drugs, the major component of the biopharmaceutical market. The bio-CMO market is oligopolistic,  dominated by a few players with large-scale manufacturing facilities such as Samsung Biologics.  Switzerland-based Lonza has 250,000-liter mammalian cell culture facilities while Germany-based  Boehringer Ingelheim has 290,000-liter manufacturing plants in Germany and the United States.    Samsung Biologics runs 364,000 liter-production facilities as of the end of 2020 as it kicked off  production of 180,000 liters at Plant#3 in 2018 and became the world’s top CMO in terms of production  capacity by surpassing established vendors.    (5) Raw material sourcing  CMO production is designed to receive manufacturing technologies from customers and produce  products that meet the customers’ needs. In case a customer supplies raw materials free of charge or  a customer designates a supplier, CMOs like the Company separately sign long-term supply contracts  with suppliers, which is a system that allows for a stable supply of raw materials.     (6) Related laws or government regulations  Regulatory authorities from all over the world have separate laws on manufacturing license by item and  approve the license after verifying the overall system of manufacturing process and quality control of  drugs through on-site inspection of new manufacturing facilities. The Company successfully obtained a total of 7 manufacturing licenses for Plant #1 from the FDA and EMA as of the end of 2016, proving its  competitiveness in offering world-class quality.    B. Company Status    (1) Operation and Production  The Company has emerged as a global leader in biologics CMO services by securing a total of 364,000- liter capacity including 360,000-liter production facilities for commercial drugs (Plant#1: 30,000 liters,  Plant#2: 150,000 liters, and Plant#3: 180,000 liters) and 4,000-liter production facilities for clinical drugs  in the Incheon Free Economic Zone (Songdo). The Company will solidify its global top position after the  completion of ongoing Plant#4(256,000 liters) construction by 2023.    (A) Production activities  If the Company signs a CMO contract with a customer, the customer first transfers its manufacturing  technologies to the Company which is called ‘Tech Transfer.’ The most important thing in this process  is to minimize the difference between processes by applying the customer’s original process into the  Company’s process. Next, manufacturing stability tests through a series of pilot production such as  Engineering Run and Process Validation Run are carried out. If stability is believed to be secured, it is  needed to apply for a manufacturing approval for produced products and production process to  regulatory authorities (FDA, EMA, etc.).    The Company cultures high-quality cells using a titer appropriate for a customer’s product specification  through an upstream process and refines active pharmaceutical ingredients through a downstream  process. All manufacturing processes need to strictly conform to each country’s good manufacturing  practice and a customer has a right to request the Company for inspection and necessary measures  for the overall manufacturing process. The Company also has to document all procedures and results  and submit them to the customer and regulatory authorities. ※ Information on Plant#4 is based on the approval from the Board of Directors meeting, held on August 11, 2020. (C) Sales activities  The Company’s global contract sales division is in charge of new business operation and sales activities,  and supports the activities for winning new contracts utilizing local manpower in main strongholds in the  Eastern and Western states of the United States including San Francisco, Boston, and New Jersey.  The sales division regularly holds meetings with global pharmaceutical companies and provides them  with information on the Company’s CMO services and manufacturing facilities at the meetings.

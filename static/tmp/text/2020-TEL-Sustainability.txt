Climate change and inequality in human rights, in particular, are pressing issues for  the global community, and there are strong calls for further action, not just by international, organizations, and national  governments, but also by the private sector. While keeping an eye on trends in the United Nations Global Compact and  RBA, and taking recommendations from third-party organizations into consideration, TEL recognizes social issues that  may affect business along the value chain, and is striving to eliminate risks in its business activities and to create new  value. Risks and opportunities TEL examined the risks and opportunities closely related to sustainable business development in consideration of social  issues and social/business environments such as SDGs. Viewing social trends from a global perspective, Tokyo Electron (TEL) uses the following process to identify important and  priority material issues (key issues) to be addressed for the medium- to long-term enhancement of corporate value. Business issues With the spread of IoT, AI, the 5G next generation communication standard, and data science*, everything is becoming  networked, and we are transitioning to an era of big data at an accelerated pace. Applications are expanding for  semiconductors and flat panel displays that support social infrastructure, and the need for technological innovation  is also growing as demand increases. Amid such circumstances, given that our business is semiconductor and FPD  production equipment, we must, while maintaining an accurate grasp on technological trends and customer needs,  promote cutting-edge research and development, and turn this into products for the market. It is also becoming  increasingly important for us to provide high-value-added services that help improve the productivity of delivered  equipment, such as remote maintenance and predictive maintenance. Examination of validity With regard to the defined material issues, an examination of validity was conducted at the review council, which included external experts. Stakeholder engagement TEL learned about stakeholder opinions and requests through ongoing dialog, before sorting through them and reviewing  the important themes to be addressed. Analysis and selection TEL has ascertained the social and business environment, considered the risks and opportunities, and put in order the  opinions and requests of all stakeholders. We have deliberated material issues from the perspectives of their importance  to both the building of a sustainable society and importance to the business to lead to increasing TEL’s corporate value.  As a result, continuing on from last year, we have defined our material issues as people and workplaces, which are important  as a resource for creating value, and management foundation, which concerns corporate governance, compliance, the  environment, human rights, and other issues, in addition to product competitiveness, responsiveness to customers, and  higher productivity, which are items identified for enhancement in the medium-term management plan.

Research and development for the future As lifestyles and business models undergo dramatic changes in the era of IoT, it is anticipated that the use of semiconductors  will expand in all industries, and there will be demands for even more advanced technologies. In an age where electronics  are a more familiar part of people’s lives, and there is an ever-growing need for semiconductors, Tokyo Electron (TEL) is  continuously engaged in rigorous discussion regarding new, necessary technologies and TEL’s contribution. TEL Technology  Vision 2030 summarizes these discussions, and is distributed within our company in order to provide information and seek  feedback. In addition, our entire company is committed to research and development in the future. Development system With advances in the performance of semiconductors resulting from miniaturization technology, the emergence of  new devices due to manufacturing technologies capable of accommodating more flexible designs, and the growth of a  market requiring large volumes of devices in step with the development of IoT, the semiconductor market is becoming  increasingly diversified. Consequently, amid the need for diversification in manufacturing technologies, TEL promotes  technology development and technology innovation for the next generations, and has built a system in which its  Development & Production Divisions collaborate with Business Divisions to bring high-value-added products into the  market in a timely fashion. Led by our Corporate Innovation Division, which was established in 2018, we have also been implementing further  enhancements to our process integration capabilities, such as deposition and etching technologies, based on our wide  lineup of semiconductor production equipment. In January 2020, we established TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of  America to optimize manufacturing functions in the U.S. region and improve operational efficiency. We are currently working on utilizing AI to strengthen the development of control software further, and in the testing  phase of the manufacturing process, we have succeeded in reducing the number of wafers used from the usual five lots  to just one lot. AI technologies have also made it possible for us to cut liquid chemical use by about 20%, helping us to use  resources more efficiently. Shift Left TEL is focused on advancing the “Shift Left” approach, investing resources (including technology, personnel, and money)  into the early processes of product development. Together with customers who conduct research with a vision beyond  even the next generation and who aim to accelerate the speed of development further, we have created a technology  road map, and are engaged in developing the various technologies required for its realization.  In fiscal year 2020, responding to the growing customer need for production equipment to take up less space, we  succeeded in improving equipment efficiency per unit area by maximizing the use of clean rooms and providing more  productive equipment. Through proposals of unique technologies, we promote on-site collaboration for early delivery  of evaluation units at customers’ plants and research and development laboratories, shortening the period between  technology development and the conversion to mass production equipment and maximizing efficiency.  Product marketing TEL is promoting effective product development by having its sales departments and product marketing departments  appropriately play their respective roles. Our sales departments take the lead in making improvements and adding  functions to existing products that have already been delivered, and provide customer feedback to our development  divisions. Our product marketing departments, meanwhile, take the lead in the development of new products, and  share guidelines based on market trends and competitor analysis with the development divisions resulting in product  development that contributes to value creation for customers. They also consider the commercialization of plans and  the addition of functions proposed by our development divisions, and formulate strategies for collaborating with partner  companies and consortiums. Through their activities, our product marketing departments are helping to effectively  promote our important “Shift Left” approach. Intellectual property management In its intellectual property-related activities, TEL’s basic policy is to contribute to increased  corporate revenues by supporting business activities through appropriate protection  of intellectual property (IP). IP personnel assigned at R&D/manufacturing sites and  headquarters assess each project from various angles, including R&D and marketing  perspectives, building IP portfolios aligned with technology, and product strategies in an  effort to boost competitiveness. In 2018, in order to uphold our worldwide advantage in  the IP field, we maintained a global patent application rate2 of approximately 70% for the  ninth consecutive year, and achieved high patent approval rates (83% in Japan and 86% in  the United States). Furthermore, as we globally expand research and development and industry- academia collaborative initiatives related to our business, the number of joint patent applications in collaboration with partner  companies, universities, and other research institutes around the world has reached 51 applications with 20 companies and 10  organizations in the last two years. To increase IP awareness, we continuously educate our engineers, who are the foundation of our R&D strategy, and in  total, around 4,300 engineers have become inventors. Additionally, because we often handle highly confidential information,  including technological information of our customers and collaborative partners, we also focus on confidential information  management education. ■Initiatives in Japan Responding to societal demands regarding energy and labor, TEL is participating in a project that brings together a group  of advanced companies with the science, engineering, humanities, and social sciences departments of Tohoku University,  Kyoto University, and Yamagata University.  The project defines three specific non-competitive areas, namely: (1) edge computing devices for IoT with extremely low  power consumption, (2) hybrid integrated power devices for high-efficiency energy conversion, and (3) intelligent electronics  systems for highly efficient labor-intensive transportation systems, and carries out research activities designed to create  innovative technologies and build a joint industry-academia platform for the development of human resources. Tohoku  University, the lead organization in these research activities and projects, hopes to contribute to creating new, world-leading  industries by achieving synergies with its competitive project for a center for industry-academia collaboration. As for project outcomes, as a consequence of developing new processes and process integration technologies in  the manufacture of spin-transfer torque-magnetoresistive random access memory (STT-MRAM2), in a world first, we  succeeded in achieving both high performance and high rewrite tolerance3 in STT-MRAM, thereby contributing to the  practical implementation of STT-MRAM and helping to expand its areas of application. Collaborating with consortiums By collaborating with international and domestic consortiums, TEL is enhancing its own research and development  capabilities, and is working to further develop cutting-edge technologies. With three bases in Japan and additional bases  in the United States, Belgium, and Singapore, we collaborate with device manufacturers in Japan and abroad and with  global research institutes to promote research into next generation semiconductor production technology. In fiscal year  2019, we began participating in a global research hub developing next generation AI hardware, and in fiscal year 2020,  we have been promoting collaboration in technologies and applications that speed up evolution, from development to  market launch. One example has been our cooperation with BRIDG1, a not-for-profit, public-private partnership located in  the U.S. state of Florida.  Our engagement in these consortiums includes the development of cutting-edge processes for existing devices and  the development of manufacturing technology for chips designed for AI computing. ■AI chip development In cooperation with partner companies in the United States, TEL is participating in the development of AI chips. The  development system we have built is completely integrated, from the architecture stage examining semiconductor  design for AI systems through to incorporation into circuits and physical design, and from manufacturing through to  research on the materials development level. Besides developing software necessary for AI to work, we are engaged in  the development of materials, processes, and equipment geared for manufacturing, leveraging our partner companies’  knowledge of design and architecture. Japan TEL Technology Center, America U.S. 1  BRIDG: BRIDG is a  not-for-profit, public- private partnership  specializing in advanced  system integration,  microelectronics  fabrication, III-V  materials deposition for  sensors, optoelectronics,  and high-speed  transistors.

Research and development for next generation computing As use of the IoT, linking a multitude of devices to the Internet, expands rapidly in society, demand for semiconductors  processing massive amounts of information quickly and efficiently, such as in data collection and management, analysis, and  visualization, is continuing to grow. At the same time, progress is taking place in the development of neuromorphic devices,  inspired by human neural circuits. When processing information on computers that use conventional architecture, there  are considerable losses in energy consumption. Such computers used in data centers consume tens of kilowatts of power,  whereas the human brain uses only about 20 W. Similarly, while the operating frequency1 of today’s semiconductor devices  is 5 GHz, the human brain is believed to run at just several tens of hertz. Progress is being made in research and development  on neuromorphic devices modeled on these human brain movements. They utilize synaptic connections2 based on analog  devices to replace the processing and memory functions, which had previously been only divided between the digital  logic and memory of a conventional microprocessor. The aim is to achieve a higher degree of information processing with  low power consumption. These neuromorphic devices require an approach of integrating analog to digital. In addition to  conventional pursuit of circuit miniaturization, development is underway for functions that mimic human neural circuits,  including resistive analog neuro device3, and nonvolatile resistive random access memory4. Furthermore, with a focus on  the energy consumed calling memory from arithmetic circuits, much is being done for faster and more energy-efficient  processing capacity by devising a better arrangement of arithmetic circuits and memory.  Leveraging its strengths in deposition and patterning technologies, Tokyo Electron (TEL) has initiated research efforts  into new materials needed for semiconductors that will be the core of next generation computing, such as neuromorphic  devices, quantum computers, logic-memory integration mixing memory with logic (compute-in-memory, memory- driven computing), as well as innovative manufacturing processes for utilizing these materials. Addressing advancements in display As communication devices become more sophisticated and diverse  in the age of IoT and 5G, higher performance is required for displays  built into those devices. Displays are continuously evolving, in terms  of higher image quality, built-in sensors, flexibility of design, and lower  power consumption. In particular, Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) displays, which are used widely in smartphones  and televisions, are expected to expand to various applications including IT and automotive,  because of their high image quality and outstanding design flexibility. TEL has released EliusTM inkjet printing equipment designed for forming the emitting layer on OLED displays. Elius  can significantly reduce the consumption of materials in the manufacturing process compared with the conventional  evaporation process. It contributes greatly to cut manufacturing costs for medium and large OLED displays. In order  to make the displays compatible with the diverse organic OEL materials that determine their characteristics, TEL is  advancing development that allows swift deployment of cutting-edge knowledge into our device technology. For the manufacturing process of the thin film transistor (TFT) array, which drives liquid crystal displays (LCD)  and OLED displays, we also developed ImpressioTM and BetelexTM plasma etch systems, as well as the ExcelinerTM  coater/developer. Impressio and Betelex use PICPTM 6, a plasma reactor with higher energy efficiency, reduces power  consumption by up to 20%, and achieving precise processing and stability in mass production. Exceliner, equipped  with our original Air Floating Coater, permits higher throughput while maintaining excellent film uniformity and saving  chemical costs. TEL continues to reduce environmental impact by improving productivity and yield. Promoting digital transformation (DX5) As the environment for utilizing AI has developed and AI has become a more familiar part of people’s lives, TEL is  expanding the opportunities for AI application, and is continually striving to achieve highly stable equipment operation  and greater efficiency in development activities. By monitoring the operating status of semiconductor production  equipment in real-time, and using AI to analyze that data, we aim to improve equipment operation efficiency and to use  resources more efficiently, such as maintenance of equipment performance, achieving wafer process uniformity, cutting  down on test wafers, and avoiding unexpected downtime. TEL’s specialized AI department, launched in 2017, plays a  key role in the development of algorithms and other projects to use AI to analyze the vast volumes of data output from  equipment. Since 2018, we have also been promoting DX across our entire company, not just in development activities  but also in the education of personnel who can utilize digital technology. AI workshops, for instance, have been held to  share the latest technology trends and to boost internal collaboration. Of the total CO2 emissions from TEL’s value chain, emissions during  product use account for 90%. For this reason, TEL has made it a key  corporate objective to promote environmentally friendly product  design, and lower the energy consumption of its products. In fiscal  year 2020, we set a medium-term environmental goal for the key  models of each business unit (BU), namely, to reduce per-wafer  CO2 emissions by 30% by fiscal year 2031 (compared with fiscal year  2014). Furthermore, in order to achieve this medium-term goal, we  set an interim goal of reducing per-wafer CO2 emissions for the key  models of each BU by 20% by fiscal year 2025 (compared with fiscal  year 2014), and we have been promoting specific activities. In fiscal year 2020, we formulated a roadmap for achieving  this goal for our key models, and we established guidelines for calculating CO2 emissions, incorporating the usual  energy and water usage, as well as process gas and chemical substance usage, product footprint, volume, and weight,  reduced frequency of parts maintenance and increased lifespan, and shorter time to equipment launch. Based on these  guidelines, the reduction in CO2 emissions for equipment shipped in fiscal year 2020 in comparison to baseline equipment  was calculated as 16%. We also began examining environmental technology strategies for achieving our medium- and  long-term environmental goals. As we work to further raise environmental awareness, we will continue to incorporate  environmental technologies as an important added value in our technological strategies. We will continue to promote  further activities for achieving our medium- and long-term environmental goals. In order to comply with each country’s environmental laws and regulations pertaining to products, TEL proactively  collects information and takes appropriate action as required. An example of our efforts for EU REACH1 is that we  properly investigate and disclose information on the presence of any chemical substances in articles. In terms of the  format used for our investigations, we previously used the Article Information Sheet (AIS) format promoted by the Joint  Article Management Promotion-consortium (JAMP2), but since fiscal year 2021, in order to address chemical substance  regulations for concentrations in the parts per billion (ppb3), we have adopted the chemSHERPA4 format, which will  become widespread as the industry/international standard. As for efforts for GHS5 requirements, we provide safety  data sheets (SDS6) when selling chemical products, and we promote the local procurement of chemical products. In  explaining and addressing the frequently revised environmental laws and regulations, we continue to offer “web-based  training for Product Environment Compliance” to all employees, and we provide suppliers with information on the  relevant environmental laws and regulations. TEL will continue to rapidly monitor each country’s environmental laws and  regulations and strive to take appropriate action. Tokyo Electron (TEL) is working toward the conservation of the global environment by upholding the environment  related medium- to long-term goals detailed the below. As a leading corporation in environmental management, Tokyo Electron works actively to conserve the global environment.  We strive to contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring society by proactively promoting the reduction of  environmental burden of both our products and facilities, and at the same time, providing evolutionary manufacturing  technologies that effectively reduce the power consumption of electronic products. substances, to another  company.) Tokyo Electron (TEL) helps customers manufacture cutting-edge devices by maintaining an accurate and timely grasp on  customer needs and providing innovative technologies for future generations. As a production equipment company with a  diverse product range, we propose comprehensive solutions contributing to value creation for customers. Making full use of  state-of-the-art AI technologies and knowledge management tools, we also provide high-value-added maintenance services  that support the stable operation of various generations of equipment. TEL strives to further enhance customer satisfaction,  which is a key management theme it has tackled since our founding, aiming to be the best and sole strategic partner for  customers. The semiconductor market has been expanding rapidly in recent years, driven by IoT, 5G, automotive automation, and  other innovations. Tokyo Electron (TEL) is building an organization to realize more effective global operations, providing  the best technologies and services to meet customer needs as the market changes.  Since 2018, we have worked to strengthen our customer responsiveness through two divisions: our Account  Sales Division, which leads to new technology development based on the needs of traditional customers of major  semiconductor manufacturers for next generation cutting-edge technology such as memory, logic, and foundry; and our  Global Sales Division appropriately addresses the needs of more than 100 new customers in Japan and overseas in such  fields as electrical appliances, automobiles, medical treatment, and healthcare. By building stronger, close collaborative  relationships with each business unit and moreover with each overseas subsidiary, our respective sales divisions provide  customers with swift, high-quality support and solutions.  We are working to build globally unified systems and structures in order to further enhance and stabilize the quality  of our service and support activities. The Global Service Committee, a regular gathering of the service leaders of each  department and each overseas subsidiary, enhances information sharing and in-house coordination, including improving  the technical skills and interpersonal skills of our more than 4,000 field engineers worldwide, the localization of start- ups, and improving work efficiency using the work-time management system. Furthermore, through TELeMetricsTM 1,  a remote maintenance service offered through our Total Support Centers (TSCs2), we provide customers with higher- value-added services, by utilizing our wealth of knowledge and range of tools to enable us to propose customized  solutions services for the various challenges they face. Because semiconductors and FPDs are becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse, in order to meet the needs of  production sites, such as improved yield and improved equipment efficiency per-unit area through enhanced productivity  and smaller footprints, TEL’s product development is initiated from the customer perspective.  Two of our divisions work closely together in turning these perspectives into products. Specifically, our Account  Sales Division identifies customer demands for next-next generation technology and beyond, and based on these, our  Corporate Innovation Division reviews the requirements and converts them into actual, tangible products. In proposing solutions to customers, we leverage a broad portfolio of equipment, including those used in the series of  key patterning processes requiring advanced levels of technology, such as deposition, coating/development, etching, and  cleaning. Through total solutions that incorporate systems and software in addition to production equipment, we seek to  optimize the production process. We strive to develop products that help strengthen our customers' competitiveness by  achieving a balance between faster and better quality semiconductor production. 1 TELeMetricsTM: Refer  to p. 24. 2 Total Support Centers  (TSCs): Refer to p. 24. As progressive improvements are made in the performance of CPUs1 and semiconductor memory, as advances are made  in miniaturization for mass production, and as transistors used in autonomous driving systems and VR/AR2 become  increasingly integrated, there is a need for semiconductors across a wide range of fields, such as medical treatment,  finance, transportation, and manufacturing. Extending the life cycle of products is another challenge, evidenced by the  growing demand for the long-term stable operation of semiconductors for automobiles and industry. Tokyo Electron (TEL) is working to further strengthen its field solutions business to ensure that shipped equipment can  operate stably in the market over a long period. We are engaged in various initiatives to help maximize our customers’  business operations, including promoting knowledge management in field service, continuously improving our field  engineers' skills, strengthening our global support system through Total Support Centers (TSCs), and expanding upgraded  models. In order to meet the needs of customers producing IoT-related products, TEL has established a system for developing  and producing new upgraded models based on previous-generation equipment supporting 200 mm wafers. Upgraded  models help customers to improve productivity and reduce environmental impact by replacing old units and parts with  new ones while maintaining compatibility with existing processes and offering performance in terms of transfer speed  and so on at the same level as the latest equipment. In fiscal year 2021, we began selling upgraded models of ALPHA- 8SE™ 3 and UNITY™ Me4, systems for peripheral devices that we had previously sold as new equipment. We also began  developing upgraded models of coating/developing equipment and cleaning equipment for 200 mm wafers. To improve the work efficiency of field engineers worldwide, and to enhance service quality and streamlining personnel,  TEL uses globally common timesheets to conduct detailed work-time management and analysis for each location and  product. In addition, intent on further improving work efficiency, we have been particularly focused on reviewing work  where considerable improvement is likely based on the types of tasks undertaken by engineers and the time taken, such  as work involved in starting up equipment and repair work. Knowledge management TEL promotes group-wide knowledge management1 so that it can deliver high-quality service swiftly to its customers.  In the area of field service, we have been working on globally implementing Service CRM2 so that we can create a  database and centrally manage customers’ equipment records (support and incident history). Having started in Japan  in fiscal year 2020, Service CRM is being progressively expanded in Singapore and Europe in fiscal year 2021. Accessible  to field engineers around the world, it allows us to increase the volume of operational knowledge data. It enables us to  respond to calls from customers faster and more accurately efficiently. In addition, regarding our system that allows  engineers to perform natural language searches (Japanese, English, and Chinese) for information they require from the  vast amount of accumulated technical documentation, efforts have been made to improve the accuracy of searches  by utilizing AI in image recognition and natural language processing. As a result, knowledge relating to incidents can be  readily searched, and predictions concerning the cause of events can be made with greater accuracy.  Going forward, as we promote efforts to manage the various systems throughout the TEL group using One Platform3,  we remain committed to further improving the efficiency of our customer responsiveness. TEL has built a global support system, establishing Total Support Centers (TSCs) in Japan, the United States, and China.  At each TSC, dedicated representatives maintain and utilize a database of information about customers’ equipment  and examples of similar incidents. The TSCs also employ TELeMetricsTM to perform remote maintenance. These systems  facilitate collaboration between the TSCs, field engineers, and plants, helping us to respond promptly and appropriately to  customer inquiries and any problems that arise. 3 Efforts to manage  systems using One  Platform: Refer to p. 28  “Continuous  improvement of  business operations.” Tokyo Electron (TEL) is committed to providing sufficient information on its products to  ensure that customers can safely use the products. All products purchased by customers  come with a TEL Safety and Environmental Guidelines manual. The manual describes  potential risks associated with using our products together with the methods for averting  those risks, as well as safety measures applied to products and recommended methods for  product disposal. It is divided into such categories as chemical, electrical, mechanical, and  ergonomic. The manual is available in 12 languages1 to ensure that customers around the  world can understand the content accurately and safely use the products. Customers are also  provided product-specific manuals tailored to the relevant product specifications.  If new safety warnings become apparent after a product ships, we contact affected  customers individually and share that information with them.  We also pay close attention to safety when delivering products that involve the use of hazardous chemicals or high  voltage electricity. Furthermore, when delivering products to a customer’s new production line, in accordance with TEL  regulations, we thoroughly consider all safety aspects beforehand by checking the customer’s facilities, equipment, safe  work standards, and so on. Taking the entire product life cycle into consideration, TEL carries out product risk assessments as early as possible in the  development phase. Based on the assessment results, we implement safe equipment design2 to reduce the risks posed to  humans. We also examine and ensure compliance with increasingly strict laws and regulations around the globe, and have  a system in place for all safety regulations of the regions where our equipment is delivered. Equipment shipped from TEL is checked by a third-party inspection organization to ensure that it complies with  international safety standards such as SEMI S23 and CE marking4. We also obtain Certificates of Conformity (CoC) from  Notified Bodies in Europe in line with the Machinery Directive and EMC Directive5. In addition, we are actively working to  comply with KC Mark, KCs Mark, and other certifications as Korea, China, and elsewhere in the Asian region strengthen  their safety laws and regulations. TEL has established training centers all over the world, mainly at its development and production sites, and is providing  customers with training on equipment operation and maintenance to ensure they are able to use the products safely. In  July 2019, we opened a new training center at Tokyo Electron Korea. Using actual equipment, practical training is being  rolled out at training centers globally, delivered by about 50 dedicated instructors whose skills have been recognized  by our own internal certification system. In addition, we also implement online education as well as on-site training at  customer’s plants.  By conducting online surveys in order to respond more quickly to our customers’ needs, and by collecting and analyzing  customer feedback, we are working to improve the content of our training programs and the equipment used. Going  forward, we will continue to give priority to customer safety as we put effort into further developing our training  environment. In October 2019, we established a training operations center to enhance the skills management, training structure, and  globalization of field engineers. Having built a group-wide skills management system in accordance with SEMATECH (a  U.S. consortium for the joint development of semiconductors), we deploy the most suitable human resources to provide  customers with service, based on an objective understanding of the skills of our engineers. We are also committed to  continuously reviewing and improving our training curricula and content from a global perspective, including establishing  a system whereby field engineers can choose the training programs they need to attend in order to improve their skills. 2 Safe equipment design:  A design concept that  eliminates the cause of  the machine's harm to  humans through the  safety design of the  machine. 3 SEMI S2: This is a set of  environmental, health,  and safety guidelines  for semiconductor  production equipment.  It is used mainly by the  leading manufacturers  of semiconductor  equipment in the United  States and Europe, not  only for ICs but also  as safe procurement  guidelines for electric  and electronic device  manufacturing  equipment around the  world. 4 CE marking: When  exporting into the  European Union,  CE marking defines  rules for displaying  a CE mark as proof  that the equipment  is safe and complies  with EU-defined rules  (Directives). 5  EMC Directive: This  is one of the New  Approach Directives  that apply to the 27 EU  member states. This  directive applies to all  electric and electronic  devices that are at  risk of being disturbed  by electromagnetic  interference or that may  interfere with other  equipment. The current  directive is 2014/30/EU. Tokyo Electron (TEL) conducts a customer satisfaction survey (TEL CS Survey) every year with the goal of making  continual improvements based on customer feedback. The survey started in fiscal year 2004, aimed at just a limited  number of divisions. It was expanded to include all semiconductor production equipment divisions in fiscal year 2014, and  later the flat panel display production equipment division and overseas subsidiaries in fiscal year 2016, and currently, it is  implemented company-wide as the Customer Satisfaction Survey Program (CSSP). Under the CSSP, we survey customers once a year, at the same time each year, and ask specific questions that will lead  to improvements on a practical level. Results from the survey are analyzed by product, account (customer), and function  (software, development, etc.), and given as feedback to customers. We also share the results with relevant divisions, such  as sales, production, and support, and implement initiatives for improvement. Improvements are also made continuously  to all aspects of the survey method, including the questions asked, the analytical methods used, and the overall operation  of the survey activities. In the customer satisfaction survey for fiscal year 2020, responses were received from approximately 1,400 individual  customers, which is 69.5% of all customers. We received evaluations of three points or higher* on 93.3% of all questions asked. When we receive an evaluation of one point (Very Dissatisfied), we respond to the customer as quickly as possible as  part of a Shift Left approach to implementing early-stage improvements throughout the survey process. Going forward,  we will continue to aim for three points or higher for 100% of the questions asked, and the entire company will work as  one to implement customer-driven improvements. ■Improvement example As a result of the customer satisfaction survey, issues that would not normally be identified were brought to light,  and persons-in-charge and managers at TEL, who are in direct contact with customers, made improvements with the  cooperation of the relevant divisions. This led to improved evaluations of three points or higher for the question relating  to software support for problem-solving, which was one of three questions we focused on during fiscal year 2020.  We believe these improved evaluation scores from customers result from our efforts to enhance support for software  operating across multiple pieces of equipment, which we have been working on for some time. Percentage of responses  that indicated customer  satisfaction 93.3% Conduct survey of  customers CS Survey activity  preparation Tokyo Electron is striving to improve productivity along the entire value chain, promoting greater standardization, efficiency,  and automation of operations throughout the group, such as by integrating business systems in each division and unifying  databases. Recognizing the importance of quality management, we are enhancing the awareness and capabilities of each  employee regarding productivity by rolling out various educational programs. In addition, we are implementing continuous  quality improvement activities throughout the supply chain in collaboration with suppliers. We will strive to enhance corporate  value, constantly pursuing higher management efficiency by implementing more streamlined business operations and quality- focus operations. As part of its business innovation for productivity and quality improvement, Tokyo Electron (TEL) is tackling system and  data integration across the entire TEL group value chain, such as development and manufacturing divisions, as well as  sales and administration divisions. The primary objective of our project to introduce a new ERP1 system is to integrate  each of our division’s previously discrete business systems, and to aggregate previously disaggregated internal data,  enabling more centralized management. By freely utilizing the aggregated data in each business operation, we can quickly  collect data needed for business decisions, make production schedules more reasonable and more efficient, visualize  delivery dates for parts, and achieve stronger coordination between sales planning and production/procurement/ inventory planning. To make the system fully operational in fiscal year 2024, we are proceeding with introducing the  system in a way that does not disrupt existing production lines. Given that the system involves business operations  performed by a range of employees, as we seek to bring the system to fruition, we are building an internal framework  for cooperation, sharing the merits of migrating to the new system and updates on progress in a timely manner with all  employees, including the project members. Since 1995, Tokyo Electron (TEL) has incorporated platform software developed in-house in its semiconductor production  equipment, and has worked on streamlining operations and improving product quality. By standardizing platform  software, we have been able to reduce the hours spent on developing duplicate functions for each type of equipment,  leading to guaranteed real-time3 control and enhancement of our response to new demands and technologies. Having  adopted such concepts as object-oriented4, we are also working on more efficient development of new platform  software for the development of next generation equipment. In addition, we are engaged in global activities to promote digital transformation (DX) development. As well as sharing  information and various tools among responsible personnel in Japan and overseas, we are expanding a range of training  programs, such as drawing up a data analysis skills map designed to improve DX skills throughout the TEL group. Amid advances in manufacturing that make the most of innovative technologies  such as IoT and AI, our customers are forging ahead in improving productivity  by taking advantage of visual representations of data, and building smart fabs5  to improve consistency in quality. In this context, we are developing necessary  software and systems for sites producing equipment, such as automation, for  reducing work time. Our specialized development and manufacturing divisions,  and business units work in cooperation to develop various functions for smart  equipment, such as simple operation, presentation of the causes and resolutions of  troubles, and autonomous operation through prediction of results. Tokyo Electron (TEL) has a quality policy shared by all group companies which it has developed and is rolling out. Quality policy ■Example initiative The Software Engineering Department at Tokyo Electron Kyushu is involved in designing, developing, and the testing and  post-release maintenance of control software for coater/developer tailored to customer requests. In addition, it works to  develop competitive software by constantly improving the development process and environment and nurturing human  resources.  The department reviewed and redesigned the configuration and structure of software, mindful of any risk of bugs  that might corrupt a program when making a design change due to the problem of the complexity in upgrading them  as a result of years of software revisions. This eliminated complexity and improved maintainability, enabling the team to  respond rapidly to customer needs.  Furthermore, over the years, the department has engaged in PDCA activities to improve the development process.  After identifying that work quality had declined due to past operational practices and preconceptions, and that there  had been a deficiency in sharing information on improvement measures, it renewed its appreciation of the importance  of doing the simple things well. It consequently worked on re-learning the definitions, procedures, and measures in  each step of the development process. It succeeded in reducing the amount of work spent on following up on non- conformance.  In the past, setting the hundreds of thousands of parameters necessary for control software to work in mass  production design relied on veteran engineers' experience. In order to improve this individualized work and to generate  accurate parameters more swiftly, the department developed “HCube”—an auto-generation tool. HCube was put  into action in April 2019, and since then, the department has seen about a 50% reduction in time spent designing new  equipment and upgrading shipped equipment. Other outcomes include a decrease in non-conformance attributable to  human error. This achievement was also praised in a third-party audit as an endeavor worthy of note. Quality Focus Quality Design and Assurance Quality and Trust Continual Improvement Stakeholder Communication Focusing on quality to satisfy customers, meet production schedules, and reduce required maintenance even with temporary cost increases. Building quality into products, assure in-process quality control, from the design and development phase throughout every process. When a quality-related problem occurs, working as a team to perform thorough root cause analysis and resolve problems as quickly as  possible. Ensuring customer satisfaction and trust by establishing quality goals and performance indicators and by implementing continual improvement using  the PDCA cycle. Listening to stakeholder expectations, providing timely product quality information, and making adjustments as needed. Return for modiﬁcation afer shipment Equipment shipped TEL is striving to enhance the awareness of every employee toward quality  by conducting various education programs. In addition to the basic education  on quality that new employees receive, we have also globally rolled out PDCA  Education and other programs that target all TEL group employees. In PDCA  Education, employees learn about the need for continuous improvement  through the four processes of plan, do, check, and act. As of FY2020, 84% of  employees had completed this program.  We also implement our own education program, called TEL 6-Step, for employees closely involved in quality control,  such as developers, designers, quality managers, and service personnel, through which they acquire a problem-solving  model to handle important issues. The program is a modified version of the eight discipline (8D) problem-solving  method2, widely used in quality control, customized to replace our problem-solving process. The program cultivates  the ability to resolve problems quickly and to take measures preventing recurrence, by thoroughly investigating  the true nature of problems, and determining the technical factors and root causes. As of FY2020, approximately  5,800 employees had attended this program. We also conduct group training targeted at quality control leaders to  provide them exercise-based learning opportunities for resolving quality-related issues to further enhance their work  improvement skills at production and development sites.  Moreover, so that employees can tackle quality improvement autonomously, we advocate QC certification3 and  encourage them to acquire fundamental skills. Since fiscal year 2012, the number of QC certified employees has increased  yearly to approximately 2,400 as of FY2020. To provide consistent, high-quality products, TEL is building quality assurance systems under the leadership of the  Representative Director and President. We have been promoting ISO 9001 quality management system certification, and  all of our manufacturing companies have completed transition to ISO 9001: 2015. Tokyo Electron (TEL) believes that making ongoing improvements in all work processes contributes to improved quality  and productivity of products and services. We will continue working hard to promote quality management throughout  the value chain while keeping track of customer needs and strengthening internal and external collaboration. 1 The Billerica Office was  relocated in May 2020. Engineers. The total  number of certified TEL has systems in place to check and comply with the latest trends in laws, regulations, and guidelines for equipment  safety. Equipment is checked by a third-party inspection organization before shipment, to ensure that it complies with  safety requirements, such as international safety standards and SEMI S26. Also, in response to the Machinery Directive  and EMC Directive7, we obtain certificates of conformity from the Notified Bodies in Europe. Promotion of Shift Left (front-loading) and self-process assurance systems In order to improve the quality of products, it is important to prevent non-conformance from occurring in upstream  processes, and to ensure thorough quality control in each process so that non-conforming products are not allowed  to flow into later processes. From this perspective, TEL promotes “Shift Left” and self-process assurance systems. With  Shift Left, in order to raise the degree of product quality at an early stage, we implement thorough risk detection and  mitigation measures (FMEA1) from the initial stages of product design in an effort to suppress the occurrence or outflow  of non-conformance. As for self-process assurance  systems, we carry out thorough inspections in each  process and conduct verifications using simulation. In  conjunction with these promotion activities, we are  also focusing on the deployment of Product Lifecycle  Management (PLM). By deploying and promoting PLM,  we comprehensively manage and analyze all processes  from product planning, development, design, and  production through to service, in an effort to facilitate  the earlier release of products, enhance work efficiency,  improve quality, and reduce costs. Response to quality problems To comply with ISO and EN2 safety standards and to achieve higher levels of safety, TEL has established its own design  rules for each of its products. As an equipment manufacturer, we have developed systems for manufacturing products,  which include safety considerations. We have other systems in place for responding to equipment design and production  non-conformance and any occupational accidents. In the event of an accident, we use our TIRS3 accident reporting system to distribute information to safety and quality  personnel in each division, officers, and management, including senior management. An accident investigation is also  conducted immediately to identify the cause and plan preventive measures.  We also use a proprietary system called QA-BOX4 to share information on equipment quality and any major non- conformance across all quality departments within the TEL group. Measures obtained from the results of an accident  investigation are promptly applied, not only to the problem equipment, but also to relevant equipment operated by  other customers, and revisions are made to current design standards. In the case of an accident caused by the wrong  cable being connected, for instance, in addition to verifying the position and shape of the slot for inserting the cable and  analyzing the factors that led to the human error, we are working to prevent a recurrence of the accident, such as by  preparing procedures that are easier to understand.  Through QA-BOX, as well as getting relevant  departments collaborating to share data on  issues, remedies, and other accident-related  information, we also assign the right personnel  and work hard to prevent accidents from  recurring.  Accident-related data accumulated in QA- BOX is utilized for the cumulative analysis of  trends to visualize the types and frequency of  problems for individual equipment, whereby  we implement countermeasures that have  an immediate impact. As we strive to prevent  problems from recurring and their associated  ripple effects, this is leading to a reduction in the  number of accidents attributable to equipment. SEMI S2: Refer to Note 3  on p. 25. 7 EMC Directive: Refer to Note 5 on p. 25. 1 FMEA (failure mode  and effects analysis):  Method to identify,  prevent, and mitigate  risks in advance Continuously improving quality based on strong partnerships with suppliers is essential for providing high-quality  products quickly to the market. Since fiscal year 2001, TEL has conducted its unique Supplier Total Quality Assessments  (STQA) in an effort to ensure its suppliers properly understand the level of quality it expects from them. Before starting  business with new suppliers, an STQA is conducted via self-assessment to evaluate their product quality, costs, and  information security. The assessment also includes their CSR initiatives, including human rights, ethics, safety, and the  environment. If a risk is identified, we visit the supplier and confirm the area of non-conformance on site. Once our  approach to quality has been confirmed, we request that they plan and implement improvement measures, and we  provide continuous support until all of them have been completed. In addition, we also conduct on-site audits once  every three years for suppliers who handle important components and for suppliers where quality issues have been  found. Since STQA is a system shared by our whole group, STQA-L meetings are held regularly, gathering together leaders  selected from among manufacturing companies to share supplier information and to resolve any issues.  We are also focused on process improvement activities using SPC1. Invariably, our customers’ production sites require  limited variations in quality between equipment, accurate process repeatability, and high productivity. To meet these  requirements, we get our suppliers who handle specific important parts to understand the importance of SPC, and we  work on implementing SPC together with our suppliers to reduce variations in the quality of parts and to maintain and  improve processes manufacturing good-quality products. ■Example initiative In the event a flaw, defect, or other non-conformance is found  in a delivered part, time and money is spent in the production  process, working to replace the part, investigate the cause, change  production schedules due to process delays, and to implement other  changes as needed.  The Quality Assurance Division at Tokyo Electron Miyagi had  previously limited its quality improvement activities to those  suppliers with a large number of non-conforming parts. During the  process of confirming the overall percentage of non-conformance  and the associated causes, it came to the realization that these  activities needed to be conducted for all suppliers. For this reason,  since fiscal year 2019, it has issued its own Quality Report to all suppliers from which parts were found to be non- conforming, and by including statements on the supplier’s level of quality and the monthly number of non-conforming  parts, it has worked to reduce non-conforming parts and foster awareness for quality.  In fiscal year 2020, the division issued reports to 108 suppliers, and as a result, non-conforming parts decreased by  17%2. One supplier acknowledged, “Using the Quality Report as a guideline to clarify issues related to quality helped us  strengthen our overall capacity to supply parts.” In addition to achieving a concrete outcome, that is, a decrease in the  number of non-conforming parts, by sharing quality improvement activities based on qualitative data with suppliers, we  are also working to raise our level of active communication.  Going forward, we will enrich the content of the reports by incorporating the feedback of suppliers and we will further  accelerate our efforts to improve the quality of parts. While conducting sustainable operations, it is also important for companies to meet new demands of society from people and  workplaces' perspectives, such as responding to workstyle reforms and employing people with diverse values. Based on the  recognition that people are the source of a company’s growth, Tokyo Electron deeply appreciates the new value created by  individual employees exercising their capabilities, while respecting their individuality and values and encouraging work styles  in sync with their respective lifestyles. In addition to developing a common global human resource system, placing the right  personnel for the right job across countries and regions, and implementing employee performance evaluations that are fair and  highly transparent, by working to strengthen human resource development programs and to promote health and safety, we  strive to nurture employees full of vitality and develop inspiring workplaces. Global human resources system, Human resource development  concept at TEL UNIVERSITY, Human resource development system New work styles, Encouraging use of leave, Childcare and nursing  systems, Employee life support Health and productivity management promotion, Activities for  safety, Incident reporting system, etc. For Tokyo Electron (TEL), corporate growth is about people. Employees are a foundation for creating value. Our aim  is for both the company and employees to grow together by engaging each employee at work, and linking this to  increased productivity for the company as a whole. Specifically, we focused on: (1) improving employee development  and engagement, such as through promoting support for career development, encouraging them to stretch themselves,  and providing opportunities for skill and leadership development, (2) improving productivity through developing  the workplace environment, such as by using IT for better operational efficiency and promoting smart work, and (3)  attracting outstanding talent such as through employer branding, strengthening partnerships with universities and labs,  and promoting internships, including international ones. To expand these initiatives effectively, human resources function  has deployed a team supporting business on a global level. It is important for Tokyo Electron (TEL) to expand its business globally and  address social changes and diversifying needs by creating new value and  continuing to grow. To achieve this in situations where there is diversity, not  just in gender, disability, nationality, or other personal circumstances, but also  different work styles and stages of life, it is essential we have an environment  where personnel can exercise their capabilities and tackle challenges while  staying highly motivated. To provide all employees with a “pleasant workplace  where anyone can work with strong motivation,” we respect and promote D&I.  In July 2019, we launched the Global D&I Council, and at a meeting held  that December attended by members from Japan and overseas, we formulated a D&I vision and slogan for the entire TEL  group. At the meeting, the topic of D&I for the TEL group was again taken up for discussion, and we reaffirmed that it is  not just about gender, but is a more inclusive endeavor.  To realize a workplace where diverse employees have a better understanding of each other and can play an active role,  we have been implementing harassment prevention education and awareness activities globally. In January 2020, we  held a D&I Talk event at our headquarters in Akasaka. The event included guest speakers and a panel discussion, and was  well attended by employees. The event was streamed live to business sites in Japan and overseas in an effort to raise  awareness for D&I among all employees in the TEL group. The Employee Resource Group (ERG) has also been launched,  and is promoting initiatives whereby the company supports employees with interest in D&I, voluntarily planning and  administering activities designed to contribute to the community and reform the corporate culture. Looking ahead, we  will work to further promote D&I throughout the entire TEL group, by formulating a three-year plan ending in 2022, and  rolling out initiatives tailored to the actual circumstances at each of our business sites in Japan and overseas, such as  expanding our training programs and organizing events. The globally integrated human resources programs introduced in fiscal year 2018 clarify the roles and responsibilities of  each employee in order to effectively support talent management. In coordination with development programs, Tokyo  Electron (TEL) supports the career development and growth of our employees by presenting the skills required for a job in  the TEL group, the knowledge they should/can acquire, and a description of expected duties at higher levels. We are also  working to build workplaces where diverse individuals can flourish, by conducting talent assessments across countries  and regions, realizing fair total rewards for employees, and utilizing a performance management system and a global  common human resource system. TEL has established TEL UNIVERSITY as an in-house educational establishment, helping employees to independently  build their careers and realize their personal goals for their growth and development. Our aim is to stand shoulder to  shoulder with each employee, supporting their self-growth and fruitful career development throughout their working  life, and create a foundation that enables the organization and individuals to trust each other and grow. TEL UNIVERSITY  plays an important part in employees realizing TEL’s vision of being “a truly global company generating high added value  and profits in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries through innovative technologies and groundbreaking  proactive solutions that integrate diverse technologies.” Through the following four initiatives, we are focusing on  employee growth that leads to corporate growth.  First is the provision of personalized learning opportunities. Since each employee’s growth is different, we are putting  effort into the practice of on-demand education1 as a mechanism that allows individuals to learn as they want, when they  want and according to their own needs. In addition to group training, by proactively utilizing e-learning programs, we are  providing opportunities for employees to learn from any location.  Second is support for career development. We are expanding programs designed for employees to quickly acquire basic  skills according to their different levels and goals through our global human resources system. Effort is being put into  providing information and tools so that employees can gain a more concrete image of their own learning, experience, and  career development.  Third is leader programs. In nurturing the next generation of leaders to support TEL’s future, we are globally expanding  our succession programs to identify and systematically nurture staff to take on the role of realizing medium- to  long-term improvement of corporate value. Selected next generation management candidates are provided growth  opportunities with an eye to the future, through participating in external training, building networks outside the  company, and cultivating a broader perspective. Fourth is the provision of global learning opportunities. For employees to acquire skills related to their duties and to  gain a broader insight, we encourage them to actively participate in both internal and external seminars. Besides training,  we are also considering a study abroad program for fiscal year 2021. Furthermore, we are moving to standardize our  core programs on a global basis so that employees are able to learn using consistent TEL group content and guidelines  regardless of whether they are in Japan or overseas. TEL provides programs adapted to different levels and goals for employees to gain world-class knowledge and skills.  We are also providing opportunities for employees to improve their understanding and to acquire knowledge on the  latest trends in TEL’s core technologies by running ongoing skill enhancement training and holding technical workshops  for skills acquisition. Tokyo Electron (TEL) recommends work styles that incorporate work-life balance, and is continuously developing work  environments to enable this. We are promoting efficient ways of working suited to our employees' lifestyles, such as  reducing commuting time and making the most of work hours, by introducing a teleworking system in addition to a  flextime system. Based on the belief that taking appropriate leave and properly managing work  hours also contributes to better employee productivity, TEL strives to correct long  work hours, and aims to enhance the leave system and promote taking leave.  Since fiscal year 2019, we have set an annual target of 70% annual paid leave  use, and have promoted employee awareness for planned use of leave. We are  also promoting regular monitoring of leave use status and urging management to  improve leave use rates, ensuring that five days of compulsory annual leave are  taken as required by law since April 2019. As a result, leave use rates were 72.6% in  Japan and 81.2% overseas during fiscal year 2020.  Our goal is to provide refreshment for employees and thereby to boost their  motivation to work. The system grants special (paid) leave from two weeks to one month per five years of service to  employees who have worked for more than 10 years. In fiscal year 2020, 901 employees in Japan and 514 employees  overseas took refreshment leave. TEL respects the various lifestyles of its employees and is investing effort  into providing an environment where each employee can thrive. In addition,  to the system made available by existing laws, we are independently  building a substantial framework that allows employees to adopt a flexible  approach to work that accords with diverse life events such as raising  children or caring for family members.  With regard to the situation in Japan, we have acknowledged the maximum extension of the childcare leave period to  the day a child reaches three years of age, as well as expanding our provision of a reduced working hours program for  childcare to include employees rearing children as far as graduation from elementary school. In addition to leave to care  for a sick or injured child, we are enriching the provision of support through establishment of our own childcare leave,  etc. As a result, currently in Japan, 42% of female TEL employees are working mothers. To further our support for the  compatibility of work, and nursing care, nursing care leave on full pay is available for up to five days. We are advancing  improvement of the system, for instance, by allowing nursing care leave to be taken up to three times per person  requiring nursing care for a one year in total. TEL is enacting a diverse range of support toward achieving a workplace environment where employees can work  energetically while each making full use of their abilities. We present regular opportunities for employees aged 50 or over  to attend seminars providing necessary information and review of financial planning, encouraging them to consider their  way of working after retirement. Furthermore, we support employees’ everyday lives by offering assistance to all age  groups on familiar topics such as nursing care for family members and inheritance. Take-up rate of annual paid leave  (overseas) 81.2% Percentage of those who returned to work after   childcare leave (Japan) 94.1% Having every employee lead a fulfilling life’s work and achieve their maximum performance  is also important for the future advancement of Tokyo Electron (TEL). To create healthy and  comfortable workplaces for employees, we are working to further develop our systems.  Besides conducting various medical checkups in accordance with the law, we also offer  face-to-face consultations by designated occupational health physicians for employees  who work long hours. Health help desks supported by occupational health physicians can  also be accessed by workers’ families, and we also offer counseling opportunities supported  by external industrial counselors for those who ask. Furthermore, we are working on  strengthening health-related support, organizing regular “line-care1” seminars aimed at management, and, where necessary,  holding liaison meetings with the health officers and health professionals at each TEL group company. Based on the “collaborative health2” concept, in cooperation with the Tokyo Electron Health Insurance Society, we are  actively expanding data health3 initiatives, providing employees health guidance and effective prevention and health  promotion according to their individual circumstances by utilizing data from medical checkup tests. As a result, we helped  raise the health literacy of employees in fiscal year 2020, demonstrated, for instance, by an increase in the percentage of  employees receiving specific health guidance4. Furthermore, during fiscal year 2020, following a widening of the scope from the previous year, all TEL group  companies operating in Japan received recognition as a White 500 company under the 2020 Certified Health &  Productivity Management Outstanding Organization Recognition Program5. We will continue to promote various  initiatives at the global level to maintain and improve our employees' health. TEL has introduced the Pep Up personal healthcare platform as a means of health management. The platform helps  employees care for their own health by enabling them to easily check their blood pressure, weight, body fat ratio, and  health age7 using the results of their medical checkups. Through Pep Up, in addition to providing information related  to their own health condition, and holding walking events, we also distribute activity trackers so that employees can  manage their exercise and calorie consumption. Based on the wellness declaration announced in 2012, TEL has promoted a variety of initiatives addressing health issues  from the perspectives of Eat-Rest-Walk-Talk. Specifically, these include body composition measurement sessions6, health  counseling workshops, and walking events, healthy food choices offered at company cafeterias, and smoking cessation  advice. In addition to raising employee awareness for health promotion in their daily lives, we provide support leading to  implementation of the wellness declaration. In terms of mental health management, employees in Japan complete a stress  check once a year using a questionnaire recommended by the Ministry of  Health, Labour and Welfare. Occupational health physicians or public health  nurses meet and talk with employees who, as a result of the questionnaire,  are determined to be under high stress, as well as any other employees who  ask. We also strive to ensure thorough mental support for our employees, such as by utilizing organizational analysis and  promoting improvements in organizations which have a comparatively heavy burden. During fiscal year 2020, the stress  check was taken by 92.9% of employees. Stress check take-up rate  (Japan) 92.9% 4 Specific health guidance:  Health guidance provided  for reducing the number  of people with metabolic  syndrome (visceral fat  syndrome) or at risk of  metabolic syndrome, and  for the early detection  and early treatment of  lifestyle diseases and  cancer, etc. 7 Health age: An indicator  showing risk of lifestyle  diseases, calculated  based on the results  of an employee’s  medical checkup. The  difference in years with  the employee’s actual  age is displayed, helping  them understand  their equivalent age in  terms of their health  conditions. Based on a culture of “Safety First,” TEL carries out ongoing activities for safety promotion. In its effort to raise the  overall level of safety and occupational health, TEL uses a management system based on OHSMS1 to manage safety and  occupational health and follows the PDCA cycle, to reduce the potential risk of work-related incidents. Moreover, by  sharing information of any issues at internal meetings, such as those of the EHS Council and the Manufacturing Company  Presidents’ Council, the company promotes safety management as a company-wide initiative. At each factory and office, monthly safety and health committee meetings are held to discuss measures for any  workplace safety or employee health issues and to conduct safety inspections. TEL has also set up a system for  autonomous problem-solving at manufacturing sites, with safety inspections by representatives from appropriate  departments at least once per month. Before starting work at TEL manufacturing sites, the details of the job and the risks are shared with all workers involved,  and they each increase their awareness in an effort to prevent incidents. In addition, effort is also being directed to safety  managers giving advice on how to manage hazards, as well as to make workers stop work and take corrective action in  the event of an unforeseen incident while on the job. In addition, TEL is implementing two education programs globally for the  establishment of safe work environments. First is TEL’s program on basic safety  targeting all employees. This is provided as introductory training for new hires  as well as refresher training every third year of employment. More than 6,000  employees completed this program in fiscal year 2020. Our second program,  advanced safety, targets employees working in cleanrooms and on production  lines. Participants are required to complete the course every year. Some portions  of rules pertaining to safety are based on Japanese law, therefore when employees are transferred overseas, they  undertake additional necessary training in a language that they understand, with the aim of standardizing education. To eliminate incidents, TEL also provides online training and risk assessment training for employees in Japan and  overseas. Also, to expand the concept of safe equipment design2 to our design, manufacture, and service operations, in  addition to online training on equipment safety, we also hold a semiannual seminar at each factory and office, inviting  an external guest to speak. Finally, we also promote our initiatives to prevent accidents, by providing our suppliers and  customers with safety information as circumstances demand. As a result of having maintained a high priority on creating safe work environments, TCIR3 has been maintained at less  than the company’s target of 0.5, with 0.23 in fiscal year 2020. If a safety-related incident occurs, the information is shared with related parties and persons in charge through the  incident reporting system, creating a system which resolves issues and leads to the proposal of measures to prevent  reoccurrence. Since fiscal year 2019, we have been operating the TEL Incident Report System (TIRS), a newly developed incident  reporting system, to improve the accuracy of report content further. TCIR 0.23 2 Safe equipment design:  Refer to p. 25. In its pursuit of more highly effective governance, Tokyo Electron (TEL) is working to further improve its corporate governance  framework, strengthen its risk management, and ensure thorough compliance. Our aim is to enhance the supervisory and oversight  roles of management and improve corporate value in the short term, but also in the medium to long term. In terms of practical  initiatives for respecting human rights, based on our Human Rights Policy, which summarizes our group-wide guiding principles  on human rights, as well as implementing extensive education and awareness-raising efforts, we are expanding human rights  due diligence (impact assessment and remediation) and grievance processes. As for supply chains, we are promoting activities in  compliance with global standards to achieve sustainable operations together with customers and suppliers. Regarding problems  of climate change and abnormal weather, which have increased in severity in recent years, endeavoring to preserve the global  environment, we have been working hard to achieve the medium- and long-term environmental goals for our products, factories,  and offices in order to reduce environmental impact along our entire value chain. As we aim to further enhance corporate value, we  are endeavoring to build a strong and sound management foundation that supports our whole group's business activities. Supervision and evaluation of strategic decision-making, Process  for evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and  management issues, Investor relations activities, etc. Risk management system and initiatives, Auditing by the internal audit  department, etc. Initiatives in the supply chain, etc. Initiatives to prevent global warming and save energy, Initiatives to  reduce water consumption, Initiatives to reduce waste, Management of  chemical substances, etc. Tokyo Electron (TEL) upholds the vision of being “a truly global company generating high added value and profits in the  semiconductor and flat panel display industries through innovative technologies and groundbreaking proactive solutions  that integrate diverse technologies.” In an environment where over 80% of our sales come from overseas, we regard  building governance structure as essential in order to become a real global company that achieves success in global  competition and achieves sustainable growth. To that end, TEL has built a framework to maximize use of worldwide  resources, and has worked to incorporate a wide range of opinions to strengthen our management platform and  technology base, establishing a governance structure capable of ensuring that TEL attains global-level earnings power. TEL uses the Audit & Supervisory Board System, which consists of a Board of Directors and an Audit & Supervisory  Board, and has achieved effective governance based on the supervision of management by the Audit & Supervisory  Board. Furthermore, in addition to the Board of Directors, whose role is to make major operational decisions and play  a supervisory role in the execution of those, and support appropriate risk-taking by executive management, we have  established systems that will facilitate growth-oriented governance directed at sustainable growth for TEL, including  the following: (1) The Nomination Committee and Compensation Committee to ensure fair, effective, and transparent  management; (2) The Corporate Senior Staff (CSS) to formulate and advance company strategy; and (3) The Business  Execution Meeting, to play a role in deliberations of the executive management. Based on an effective governance structure that supports increasing corporate value over the medium- to long-term,  the Board of Directors is capable of properly supervising and evaluating (monitoring) the strategic decision making of  the management responsible for business execution. The CEO and Representative Directors will play the primary role in  continually anticipating candidates for succession, primarily from among executive officers, and working to develop such  candidates in order to develop human resources who will assume management of operations in the next generation to  support the sustainable growth of TEL. The CEO and Representative Directors continually evaluate the skills, character,  dignity, and insight of successor candidates from multiple perspectives in the course of performing day-to-day duties,  and continually support education of the candidates through assignment, training, and other opportunities. Meanwhile, to supervise the soundness of management by the Board of Directors, the Audit & Supervisory Board has  developed a structure that enables its board members to obtain sufficient information necessary for audits through  on-site surveys conducted by the full-time Audit & Supervisory Board members as well as appropriate coordination with  the internal audit department and independent auditors. In addition, as advisory bodies, the Nomination Committee  and the Compensation Committee make proposals to the Board of Directors regarding the election of candidates for the  management team and compensation, thereby ensuring fair, effective, and transparent management. We operate the Board of Directors under the system described above to maintain the sustainability of the Board of  Directors appropriate for resolving management issues. TEL’s basic approach is for appropriate allocation of company earnings to all stakeholders. Our basic policy of allocation to shareholders is to link dividend payments to business performance on an ongoing  basis and maintain a payout ratio of around 50% based on net income attributable to owners of the parent company.  Furthermore, in light of stable distribution of dividends, we also set the minimum full-year dividend at 150 yen per share. TEL effectively uses internal capital reserves to raise corporate value through earnings growth by concentrating  investment in high-growth areas and provide returns directly to shareholders by linking dividend payments to business  performance and earnings. Furthermore, TEL flexibly considers implementing share buybacks as part of shareholder  returns. In electing executive directors, the Nomination Committee places importance on, among others, superior execution  abilities underpinned by experience, insight, and a track record in management, high sensitivity to all possible risks, and  being able to properly analyze and judge matters and frankly state the opinion that they believe to be correct during  debates. At the same time, in order to ensure constructive debate in Board of Directors meetings born out of a broad  range of backgrounds and knowledge, the Committee proposes personnel with an in-depth knowledge of various  divisions as corporate director candidates to the Board of Directors, taking into consideration the balance between Sales  and Service, Manufacturing, R&D, and Corporate Administration. The role of Executive Directors does not end with referring and explaining proposals as the representative of each  division. They also contribute to active debate, proper decision-making, and supervision of execution through objective,  constructive opinions coming from different perspectives of each Corporate Director. Independent outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members state their unreserved opinions from an  independent perspective so that the debates do not follow the same line of discussion proposed by internal corporate  directors. By doing so, they play the role of guiding Board of Directors debates in the proper direction to win global  competition. In electing independent outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members, we place  importance on maintaining a good balance among human resources who have qualities such as knowledge of global  business; broad insight into related industries; an extensive network of personal contacts; social viewpoints; objectivity from  the perspective of the capital market and others; knowledge of finance and accounting; and broad legal knowledge. Setting the strategic direction of the TEL group is recognized as the main role of the Board of Directors. It engages in  constructive debate of management strategy, management plans, and other matters that have been debated by the  Corporate (CSS). It serves as the venue for supervising progress on the Medium-term Management Plan and other matters.  The Board of Directors also seeks reports and explanations on the status of deliberations at the Business Execution Meeting  to monitor whether decision making by executive management functions properly in relation to matters for which approval  authority has been delegated to executive management. At Board of Directors meetings, independent outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members actively provide  advice and ask questions to the explanations and statements made by executive directors well versed in business. The  combined perspectives of both parties have enabled the Board of Directors meetings to achieve an appropriate sense of  productive tension and constructive discussions that are essential for business execution decisions and supervision. To obtain appropriate advice and questions from independent outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members,  the administrative office provides them with explanations on proposals in advance of the Board of Directors meeting as  needed. For matters of particular importance, we establish a venue for dialog between independent outside directors and  Audit & Supervisory Board members and TEL executive management, striving to provide sufficient information to, and  engage dialog with, independent outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members. * Annual DPS of not less than 150 yen * Review dividend policy if the company does not generate net income for two consecutive fiscal years. 50.0% Fixed basic compensation Fixed basic compensation has been established in reference to the compensation standards of industry peers in Japan  and overseas, with the scale of job responsibilities based on the job grade framework provided by the external specialist  organization. Annual performance-linked compensation Annual performance-linked compensation consists of cash bonuses and stock compensation-based stock options. It  is profit-sharing compensation that is linked to the business performance in the relevant fiscal year. Actual net income  attributable to owners of parent and actual consolidated ROE performance are incorporated in the formula. Medium-term performance-linked compensation Medium-term performance-linked compensation is performance share (stock-based) compensation designed to  encourage corporate directors to share a shareholder perspective by holding TEL shares and raise their awareness toward  enhancing corporate value. The number of TEL shares awarded to each corporate director varies according to the payout  rate based on their respective responsibilities and performance goal achievement levels for the three-year coverage  period. Consolidated operating margin and consolidated ROE have been adopted as the indicators for measuring the  performance goal achievement levels that are linked to the Medium-term Management Plan. Non-performance-linked (share-based) compensation Non-performance-linked compensation is share-based compensation applicable to outside directors. It has been  introduced for the purpose of making the compensation system for outside directors more consistent with their  expected role of giving advice to the management from the perspective of increasing corporate value over the medium  to long term and in addition to their duties of supervising management. Under this share-based compensation system,  TEL shares are granted after the expiration of the period covering three fiscal years. As its basic policies on executive compensation, the TEL group emphasizes (1) Levels and plans for compensation  to secure highly competent management personnel with global competitiveness; (2) High linkage with business  performance in the short term and medium- and long-term increase of corporate value aimed at sustainable growth;  and (3) Securement of transparency and fairness in the decision process of compensation and appropriateness of  compensation. Compensation for internal corporate directors consists of fixed basic compensation, annual performance- linked compensation, and medium-term performance-linked compensation.  For outside directors, TEL introduced non-performance-linked stock-based compensation, starting for fiscal year 2020,  while abolishing the annual performance-linked compensation (cash bonuses). As a result, compensation for outside  directors now consists of fixed basic compensation and non-performance-linked compensation. Compensation for Audit  & Supervisory Board members consists solely of fixed basic compensation in consideration of their role being primarily  the audit and supervision of management.  In order to secure transparency and fairness in management and appropriateness of compensation, the Compensation  Committee, which is chaired by an independent outside director, utilizes advice from an external expert, performs an  analysis of wage levels and other compensation compared to industry peers in Japan and overseas. The Committee then  proposes to the Board of Directors a compensation system that is globally competitive and most appropriate for the TEL  group, and individual compensation amounts for the Representative Directors. TEL discusses and evaluates the effectiveness of the Board of Directors every year in accordance with the TEL Corporate  Governance Guidelines. In fiscal year 2020, we again conducted a questionnaire of all corporate directors and Audit  & Supervisory Board members regarding major items for evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, the  Nomination Committee, and the Compensation Committee. In addition to the results of this questionnaire, opinions  exchanged and deliberations held mainly by outside directors and outside Audit & Supervisory Board members  were shared with the whole Board of Directors. In this way, we deliberated on and comprehensively evaluated the  effectiveness of the Board of Directors. Regarding this questionnaire, in an effort to obtain highly objective supervisory  insight and evaluation, we seek perspective and input from external consultants, and analyze the results. Issues identified  through such analysis and evaluations are discussed in depth by the Board of Directors, and efforts are taken to make  improvements as appropriate.  In fiscal year 2020, gender diversity increased in the composition of the Board of Directors, and the appropriate ratio of  outside directors was also discussed by the Board of Directors. Moreover, we held off-site meetings, aside from Board of  Directors meetings, where matters that are important in the medium to long term were predominantly discussed, such as management strategy, risk management, group governance, and CSR. With regard to the Compensation Committee,  an outside director was appointed as chairman to improve its independence. Discussions at the Compensation  Committee regarding the topic of what executive compensation should be going forward, as well as discussions at the  Nomination Committee about succession plans, were both shared with the Board of Directors. We believe that, under the systems described above, our Board of Directors ensure, with a high level of effectiveness  in general, that they appropriately fulfill the major roles of the Board of Directors prescribed in the TEL Corporate  Governance Guidelines, such as “indicating the management strategy and vision” and “making major operational  decisions based on strategic direction.” We also recognize that other bodies, establishing the Nomination Committee and  the Compensation Committee, function effectively. Based on the results of the evaluation of effectiveness conducted this time, TEL’s Board of Directors strives to secure  sufficient opportunities and time to discuss our medium-to-long-term management strategies fully. It will also work on  further strengthening TEL’s risk management system and group governance. With regard to the Nomination Committee,  we will consider the relationship of the Committee and the Board of Directors, while conducting a review toward an  appropriate member composition in order to increase the objectivity of the Committee. Moreover, we will strengthen  dialog with our stakeholders, with ESG and SDGs in mind. At TEL, we understand that appropriate information disclosure and dialog with capital markets  improve management transparency and contribute to improved corporate value, so our  senior management is actively involved in IR activities. The Chairman of the Board of Directors  and president act as spokespeople when necessary at Japanese and overseas IR conferences  and individual interviews to ensure two-way communication with capital markets. The IR  Department, which was established under the direct control of the president, also regularly  reports capital market feedback to senior management to help inform management decisions. Reflecting changes in society and the business environment, the risks facing businesses are growing increasingly complex  and diverse. Tokyo Electron (TEL) considers understanding and appropriately addressing the risks that it may face in its  businesses, as well as their impacts, to be essential to its sustainable growth. Risk management system and initiatives In order to promote more effective risk management, TEL carries out enterprise risk management* through a body  established within the General Affairs Department at its headquarters. This body works with the respective departments  responsible for each operation to identify a wide range of risks arising in corporate activities (such as compliance risk,  human resource and labor risk, and business continuity risk). It then classifies risks with high impact and probability as  key risks within the TEL group. The body also formulates and executes measures to minimize these key risks, monitors  the effect of said measures, works to understand the status of risk control, and implements the PDCA cycle for risk  management. In fiscal year 2020, in addition to these activities, the body conducted interviews with the responsible  departments at the corporate headquarters, and Japanese and overseas subsidiaries to understand the status of  risk management. From fiscal year 2021 onward, it also plans to enhance the various functions and systems of risk  management and internal audits to further promote highly effective risk management activities. The status of these  activities is regularly reported to the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board. Auditing by the internal audit department The Global Audit Center serves as the internal audit department for the entire group and implements audits based on the  audit plan. Based on the results of these audits, it provides instructions for making improvements as needed, confirms the  progress of these improvements, and provides any necessary support. The group’s internal control over financial reporting  in fiscal year 2020 was also evaluated as effective by the independent auditors. ■Environment With climate change and abnormal weather becoming an urgent issue on a global scale, it is becoming increasingly  important for companies to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and industry codes of conduct, and to  reduce environmental impacts throughout the value chain. In addition to initiatives to reduce the environmental impacts  of its products, factories, and offices, to help achieve its medium- to long-term environmental goals, TEL is working to  reduce operating costs and create business opportunities related to the environment, including the provision of production  technologies for developing more energy-efficient devices. We are also promoting environmental management across  the entire company. We have also declared our support of the TCFD2 recommendations and analyzing and disclosing the  impacts and opportunities of climate change on our businesses in line with the international framework. ■Human rights In our global society, human rights issues such as inequalities, discrimination, and forced labor are becoming increasingly  serious. At the same time, it is becoming more important for companies to conduct sustainable operations by eliminating  human rights-related business risks and respecting the rights of the people behind their business activities. While  clarifying its approach to human rights, identifying human rights risks, and implementing corrective actions in accordance  with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, TEL is making further improvements to its  reporting systems and other grievance mechanisms. We are working to ensure such human rights as freedom, equality,  non-discrimination, freely chosen employment, health and safety, and working hours. We are incorporating respect  for human rights in every aspect of our business activities. In this way, we are striving to further improve employee  engagement and create new value. ■Research and development To maintain a competitive advantage and continue growing in markets where technological innovation is rapid, it is  important for businesses to continuously create innovation and to provide high value-added products and services.  While actively investing in research and development of leading-edge technologies to enhance its own research and  development capabilities, TEL is also focusing on collaboration with Japanese and international consortiums. In addition,  we are sharing technology roadmap with our customers and collaborating with them in the early stages of development  to ensure our research and development activities properly reflect future needs. Going forward, we will continue to drive  technological development for the next generation through a group-wide development structure for collaboration  between the Development & Production Divisions and Business Divisions. ■Supply chain management For manufacturers of semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment, implementation of sustainable supply  chain management is an essential part of such activities as development, production, and providing services. To prepare  for disruptions to the procurement of important parts or production due to earthquakes or other natural disasters, TEL  works, on an ongoing basis, to establish alternative production structures within its network and to develop a multi- source system for important parts. Furthermore, in addition to formulating business continuity plans (BCPs) and holding  regular drills, we are building seismically isolated production buildings, adopting appropriate inventory controls, and  taking other steps to establish stable product supply systems. ■Information security With information security becoming increasingly important as more and more of society is data-driven, it is equally  important that companies work to improve their information literacy and build robust information infrastructure.  TEL is focusing on information security risk from the two perspectives of cybersecurity and confidential information  management. To improve cybersecurity, we use a combination of industry-leading security systems, providing security  training for employees, and work to protect our information from the sabotage of our servers or computers as well  as data theft, data manipulation and other forms of cyberattacks. The information security environment, including  cyberattack methods, is continually changing. TEL is always working to stay ahead of these changes and formulating and  implementing the necessary countermeasures on a global basis. To improve confidential information management, our  Human Resources Department and Intellectual Property Department work in close collaboration to strengthen measures  to prevent leaks of confidential information, particularly targeting employees who retire or resign to ensure proper  management of confidential information, including the return and destruction of data. Risk management initiatives Each year, TEL identifies key risks for the group and steadily works to reduce those risks. In fiscal year 2020, we reinforced  measures in the following areas1. 1 Refer to p. 45 for  information on  reinforced measures for  compliance risk. 2 TCFD: Refer to p. 8 for  TCFD. Stakeholder trust is essential to business activities. In order to maintain this trust, it is essential to continuously ensure  compliance and enhance corporate ethics. The Code of Ethics of the Tokyo Electron group establishes the “appropriate  actions to be taken” in conducting business operations in an honest and fair manner in accordance with the laws and  regulations of the countries and regions in which the Tokyo Electron (TEL) group operates as well as with internal  regulations and rules, and stipulates that all executives and employees must understand and apply the Code of Ethics. In order to strengthen our compliance system and to ensure efficacy, people responsible for compliance (Regional  Compliance Controllers) have been appointed at key overseas sites, creating a system for direct reporting to the newly  established Chief Compliance Officer and Compliance Department. The primary role of the Compliance Department is to  formulate and review practical compliance programs for the TEL group, establish and implement corporate ethics, plan  and implement education and training, and establish and operate internal reporting systems. Corporate ethics In addition to establishing the Code of Ethics as common and minimum standards of conduct  by which all executives and employees should abide, we have also established a Business Ethics  Committee for the purpose of promoting and raising awareness of compliance and corporate  ethics more effectively within the TEL group. We have also set up the Disciplinary Committee as  a subordinate organization of the Business Ethics Committee for the purpose of ensuring that  reasonable and appropriate punishments are imposed, and proper procedures followed when taking  disciplinary action.  To ensure awareness of the Code of Ethics, we arrange to translate it into five languages for local  use, including Japanese, and distribute it in the form of a booklet to all executives and employees.  In May 2020, the Code of Ethics was revised. In addition to reflecting standards required as a  global company, we added a number of new provisions on such important issues as personal  data protection, information security, and money laundering. The revisions, including changes to the booklet design  and adoption of a bullet point format, were made in pursuit of clarity and usability. We strive to further strengthen  compliance and corporate ethics by annually obtaining confirmation from all executives and employees that they  understand and comply with the Code of Ethics. Global policies on anti-bribery and competition laws In fiscal year 2021, we will establish common global policies on anti-bribery and competition laws. Under our anti-bribery  policy, we reviewed our standards concerning gifts, entertainment, and donations, and we thoroughly enforce a process  requiring preapproval if undertaking conduct outside these standards. As for our policy on competition laws, we have  compiled different types of violations in an easy-to-understand format, based on applicable laws and regulations in the  countries and regions in which we operate. In the event of a report or request for advice, the TEL group undertakes an investigation in accordance with internal  regulations. If, as a result, a compliance violation is found, a disciplinary action is imposed in accordance with the Rules of  Employment2. Preventive measures and corrective measures, such as improvements to the workplace environment, are  also implemented as necessary.  In fiscal year 2020, a total of 64 cases were received via internal reporting mechanisms (excluding overseas  subsidiaries), primarily concerning harassment, attendance management, and work environment. Among these, there  were no reports or cases of non-compliance with laws, regulations, or the Code of Ethics that could have had a material  impact on the TEL group’s business or local communities. Compliance training We conduct online and face-to-face training adapted to different levels for all employees1. In fiscal year 2021, we will  deploy a more comprehensive and systematic training program and advance multilingual support to reinforce efforts to  foster compliance awareness and behavior-oriented awareness-building activities in the TEL group. Internal reporting system As a means for employees to provide information and seek redress outside the chain of command about behavior that is,  or may be, in violation of laws, regulations, or corporate ethics, we have established internal reporting mechanisms that  ensure confidentiality, anonymity, and the prohibition of retribution. Apart from an internal point of contact that can also be  accessed by suppliers, our reporting mechanisms include an external point of contact at a law firm that can be contacted  directly. In March 2020, we enhanced the internal reporting system, and  renamed TEL group Ethics & Compliance Hotline—a global common point  of contact that uses a third-party system—thereby ensuring a greater level  of confidentiality and anonymity. This hotline can be accessed via phone or  a dedicated website 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and accommodates all  languages used by employees. Conscious of its corporate social responsibility, Tokyo Electron (TEL) recognizes that it is important to conduct itself with  a strong sense of integrity. Based on this recognition, TEL has firmly upheld human rights since its founding, as reflected  in the spirit of its Corporate Philosophy and Management Policies. For TEL, respecting human rights means a significant  undertaking, not only to fulfill its responsibility for eliminating adverse impacts on people caused through business  activities, but to respect those people who support the company’s business activities, and contribute to the realization of  a sustainable, dream-inspiring society. TEL incorporates the concept of respect into every aspect of its business activities,  and strives to nurture a dynamic corporate culture where each person can realize his or her full potential. www.tel.com/csr/employee/diversity/ URL Relevant  divisions,  etc. 1 Training and seminar  topics include basics  of corporate ethics  and compliance, anti- corruption, export  compliance, insider  trading prevention, the  Act for Subcontracting,  and the prevention  of harassment. Some  training is limited to  certain employees. has made a report or  sought advice on his/her  own volition. In fiscal year 2018, TEL formulated its Human Rights Policy, summarizing its approach to human rights. TEL has specified the  human rights it believes are particularly important in business activities as Freedom; Equality & Non-Discrimination; Freely  Chosen Employment; Product Safety & Workplace Health and Safety; Freedom of Association; and Appropriate Working Hours  & Breaks/Holidays/Vacations. In preparing the Human Rights Policy, we referred to the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights and the International Bill of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and  Rights at Work referred to therein, the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and the RBA Code of Conduct1. TEL is focusing on ensuring awareness and implementation of the Human Rights Policy internally and by suppliers.  In fiscal year 2019, we published the policy on our website and made it available for everyone inside and outside the  company, and implemented an online human rights education program targeting all TEL executives and employees. In fiscal year 2020, we also conducted due diligence on human rights, conducted human rights risk surveys, and  identified and assessed impacts. As part of the surveys, we utilized a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) for internal use  based on the RBA Code of Conduct, and a CSR survey2 for suppliers of materials, staffing, and logistics, to understand the  current situation throughout the value chain. We are using the results of these surveys to identify and assess impacts, and  to clarify and implement corrective action. TEL recognizes the importance of having highly effective grievance mechanisms and it is working to establish and operate  those mechanisms. In fiscal year 2020, we further strengthened our internal and external reporting systems in Japan and  overseas for employees and suppliers, and started operation. By continuing to conduct due diligence on human rights going forward, we will assess and correct any human rights  issues we identify in our business activities, and further improve the grievance mechanisms we provide. From the internal assessment results, we identified potential human rights risks in  the areas of labor, and health and safety. In the area of labor, we will continue efforts  to ensure working hours are in compliance with laws and regulations while further  streamlining operations. In the area of health and safety, we will work to reduce  human rights risks by improving relevant equipment. From the supplier assessment  results, we identified potential human rights risks in labor, health and safety.  Therefore, we have  requested they reconfirm working hour requirements according  to laws and regulations, industry codes of conduct, and take other actions, including  preparing for emergencies. 2 CSR survey: Refer  to Supply Chain  Management on p. 48. 1 RBA Code of Conduct:  The RBA establishes a set  of standards for supply  chains in the electronics  industry for a safe labor  environment, to ensure  that workers are treated  with respect and dignity,  and that companies  take responsibility for  environmental impact  in the manufacturing  process. Responsible procurement of minerals (conflict minerals) TEL regards taking action against conflict minerals (3TG4) obtained through illegal exploitation, including sources with  human rights violations or poor working conditions, an important part of corporate social responsibility. The company’s  resolute goal is to eliminate the use of raw materials made from these conflict minerals, as well as any parts or  components containing them. In fiscal year 2020, TEL conducted its sixth annual survey on potential conflict minerals, using the reporting template  (CMRT5) developed by the RMI6. As a result, TEL identified 261 RMAP7 conformant smelters, providing the company  confidence that 3TG sourced from these smelters were conflict-free. None of the materials procured were found to  contain conflict-affected 3TG. CSR operations To keep track of its suppliers’ engagement in CSR activities, TEL has conducted a CSR Survey since fiscal year 2014.  The survey is in accordance with the RBA Code of Conduct. We analyze the responses from suppliers and use them as  feedback to assist with further improvement activities. In accordance with auditing standards stipulated by the RBA,  the survey targets materials suppliers1 from which we procure parts and raw materials. In the fiscal year 2020 survey,  improvements in overall rating level were observed at 36% of suppliers and improvements in the overall raw score  were seen at 56%. Also, no suppliers were engaged in any of the practices given particular emphasis in the RBA Code of  Conduct, namely, child labor, forced labor, bonded labor, inhumane treatment, false reports, falsification of records, or  bribery. Neither were any suppliers of a sufficient size2 to be considered high risk in terms of compliance. From fiscal year 2019, we also began surveying staffing suppliers who provide temporary employees, contractors, and  other workers, and logistics suppliers3 with a focus on major logistics/customs clearance operators. Procurement principles and system The high-value manufacturing that Tokyo Electron (TEL) strives for is based on the functions of all materials and  components that make up the products and the pursuit of high quality. TEL values communications with suppliers and  seeks to grow manufacturing on a global scale with its suppliers based on ongoing trusting relationships. We engage in procurement activities in line with our own procurement policy, which we formulated based on the  laws, regulations, and social norms of each country, as well as the RBA Code of Conduct. We then disseminated it within  the TEL group to suppliers. Under the leadership of the TEL Representative Director, President & CEO, as the top of  the procurement system, issues identified during procurement activities are shared with the manufacturing company  presidents’ council and the purchasing department manager council for consideration of specific improvements. Procurement BCP As part of its Business continuity plans (BCP), TEL collaborates with the  suppliers for disaster preparation. The company maintains a database of  suppliers’ production sites so that if a crisis arises, it can promptly identify  impacted suppliers and quickly collaborate in recovery efforts. During fiscal  year 2020, about 18,000 supplier sites were registered, and post-disaster  impact surveys were conducted eight times. In addition, for key suppliers accounting for more than 80% of the  TEL’s procurement spend, it conducts a BCP survey8, analyzes their  responses, and gives the results to suppliers as feedback to promote further improvement. In the fiscal year 2020 survey,  improvements in overall rating level were observed at 16% of suppliers, and improvements in the overall raw score were  seen at 40%. U.S. 2.2% China 3.2% Percentage of supplier sites by country (FY2020) Taiwan 1.0% Other 4.7% Japan 88.9% 1  Surveys have been conducted since fiscal  year 2014 for suppliers  accounting for more  than 80% of TEL’s  procurement spend. Tokyo Electron (TEL) has established two new bodies, the Council of Environmental General Managers and the TEL  Corporate Environmental Council, to promote activities in the medium to long term, responding to the rising importance  of environmental issues, such as climate change, and meeting the environmental/ESG needs of its customers and other  stakeholders. The councils are composed of TEL representatives in charge of the environment as well as members from  related division. They are responsible for reviewing our overall environmental direction and our progress in achieving our  medium- and long-term environmental goals. Furthermore, to continuously improve our environmental activities, we  have operated an environmental management system based on ISO 14001 since 1997, primarily at our manufacturing  subsidiaries. In March 2017, we acquired multi-site ISO 14001 certification for our factories and offices in Japan that  had previously acquired certification separately. Coinciding with this multi-site certification, we have developed  a standardized group format for environmental impact assessments, the identification of useful environmental  aspects, environmental management programs, and internal audit checklists. During fiscal year 2020, we established  approximately 100 environmental goals for different levels across the entire group and carried out these improvement  activities. Progress of activities and compliance with laws and regulations are confirmed through internal audits and  third-party audits. Any issues identified through these activities are reviewed by the EHS Council, reported to the  Manufacturing Company Presidents’ Council, and reflected in environmental activities across our entire group. Under such an environment management system, fiscal year 2020 was again free from environmental incidents,  accidents, violations, and associated legal proceedings. The various issues related to the environment impact on our daily lives and the business activities of companies. Physical  risks, such as rising average global temperatures, strong winds, disasters, and water shortages caused by climate  change and abnormal weather, heighten the risks in business, such as damage to assets, increased operating costs, and  impacts on the supply chain. In terms of legal risks, we recognize that stronger environmental laws and regulations,  more stringent regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, the introduction of carbon taxes, and so on will lead to higher  costs for associated measures. At the same time, promoting environmental initiatives leads to more opportunities  to sell outstanding, environmentally friendly products, reduce operating costs, and further improve corporate value.  As a participant in the semiconductor and flat panel display (FPD) industry, by leveraging our advanced technological  prowess to create added value, we can contribute to the creation of semiconductor and FPD products with low power  consumption and the building of an energy-saving society that makes the most of information technology. Based on the requirements of ISO 14001, we identified and analyzed internal and external issues in relation to the  environment, namely, our relationship with the climate, air quality, and water quality. We also clarified the environmental  needs and expectations of customers, suppliers, governments, and employees, and identified the compliance obligations  of our group. From this information, TEL has set the following as its risks and opportunities to address: (1) environmental  management by reducing the environmental impact of its business activities, (2) compliance with applicable laws, and (3)  enhancing product competitiveness with the environmental contribution of products. * The Billerica Office was  relocated in May 2020. The total of Scope 1 and Scope 2 of the TEL group is 171 kilotons, while Scope 3 accounts for a total of 5,874 kilotons,  which is approximately 97% of the total. TEL believes that it is particularly important to develop products with low  CO2 emissions during operation, as CO2 emissions from the use of products sold amount to 5,229 kilotons, which is  approximately 87% of the overall total. ■Example initiative 1 Tokyo Electron Technology Solutions (Tohoku Office) is using energy more efficiently, having put heat-insulating  materials around steam pipes in boiler rooms to prevent heat from discharging. As a result, we expect to reduce our use  of heavy oil by 31,000 liters a year, which will also reduce emissions of 84 t-CO2. By recognizing environmental impact throughout the value chain, TEL develops business activities that are conscious  of reducing this impact. Based on its environmental slogan “Technology for Eco Life,” it aims to resolve environmental  problems through leading technology and reliable services. Each TEL plant and office has an established goal of reducing energy consumption by at least 1% year-over-year.  Initiatives to achieve this goal include energy-saving cleanroom operation, appropriate temperature settings for office  cooling and heating, the introduction of highly energy-efficient equipment, and the adoption of renewable energies. As a result of these initiatives, in fiscal year 2020, we increased energy consumption per unit sales at our factories and  offices by 20% year-over-year. However, an increase in its volume of production and an increase in energy consumption  associated with product development and evaluation resulted in power consumption of 318 GWh in fiscal year 2020,  up 4% year-over-year; and energy-derived CO2 emissions* of  144 kilotons, down 2% year-over-year. Based on the correlation  between business operations and energy use, we changed to a  more appropriate metric in fiscal year 2019, and have since applied  it as standard at factories and offices across Japan. Specifically, we  adopted a metric calculated using a complex weighting of data from  each area on the number of evaluation units used in development,  the number of units produced, total floor area, and staff-hours. As  a result, goals were achieved at 6 out of 11 factories and offices in  Japan and overseas. ■Example initiative 2 Tokyo Electron Miyagi is reusing waste oil from the staff cafeteria to produce biofuel. In fiscal year 2020, it began using  this biofuel in generators and forklifts at the same site. consumption. Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions  from use of fuel and gas  owned or controlled  by TEL upstream activities,  which include emissions  associated with  purchased or procured  products and services,  and downstream  activities, which include  emissions associated  with sold products and  services. To curb the amount of waste generated and to recycle it wherever possible, the TEL  group promotes initiatives to reduce waste. In addition to participating in the electronic  manifest system3 to ensure proper waste management, we are engaged in maintaining  an appropriate amount of parts inventory and in reusing cushioning material. We are  also achieving lower waste processing costs by promoting waste sorting activities, and  by modifying space used for storing waste to increase storage capacity and reduce the  frequency of collection. In fiscal year 2020, we surveyed waste disposal operators in Japan  using a unified on-site checklist, and we shared the results. In fiscal year 2020, we generated  142 tons of incinerated and landfill waste in Japan. As a result of our waste-reduction  initiatives, the recycling rate4 at sites in Japan in fiscal year 2020 was 98.9%, achieving our single-year goal of maintaining  a recycling rate of 97% or higher for the 14th consecutive year since fiscal year 2007. We have also maintained a high level  of recycling at its overseas factories and offices of 90.3%. ■Example initiative At Tokyo Electron Miyagi, we have promoted a reduction in blow-off water1 by installing a system in the cooling tower  to prevent scale2 from building up. In addition to achieving a reduction in water consumption, it is expected that  introducing this system will also eliminate the need for liquid chemicals that were previously used for preventing scale  build-up, and will result in less power being consumed because of an improvement in heat exchange efficiency. Other  added benefits of the system are that it lengthens the life of pipes by preventing corrosion, and it reduces cleaning  time by controlling algae. TEL promotes the use of renewable energies. At the Tokyo Electron Miyagi (Taiwa Office) and Tokyo Electron Technology  Solutions (Fujii Office, Hosaka Office), renewable energy generated from solar panels is used to power the factories, and  monitors displaying their energy profile have been set up at the entrances to the factories. At its Tokyo Electron Kyushu  (Koshi Office), generated energy is sold, helping to prevent global warming. In fiscal year 2020, TEL generated a total of  3,804 MWh of renewable energy in Japan. In addition, Tokyo Electron U.S. Holdings has continued to purchase green power, 3,334 MWh, in fiscal year 2020. With the growing importance of water resource preservation in global environmental initiatives, the TEL group has  established a goal of keeping water consumption at the same level or below that of the baseline year (fiscal year 2012  for factories and offices in Japan and a fiscal year of their choosing for each overseas operation). TEL’s ongoing efforts  to achieve these goals include reusing pure water from its manufacturing operations, installing water-saving devices,  watering lawns with rainwater, and implementing the intermittent operation of cafeteria faucets. During fiscal year 2020, as a consequence of new buildings coming online and an increase in water consumption  associated with product development and evaluation, water consumption amounted to 1,305,000 m3, up 5% year-over- year. Moreover, we achieved 9 of the 13 goals in our factories and offices worldwide. It also discharged an estimated  1,078,000 m3 of wastewater. Recycling rate  98.9% 2 Scale: An inorganic salt  compound (calcium,  magnesium, etc.)  contained in water,  which hardens on the  surface of equipment  and pipes paper-based manifests  (i.e. paper forms for  tracking industrial waste). The system  uses a communications  network of data TEL has been promoting activities designed to reduce the environmental impact of its logistics. We have been  implementing a modal shift2 from air to ocean transportation for the overseas shipping of our semiconductor and FPD  production equipment, and at the same time, we have been working hard to reduce production lead times. We have also  been endeavoring to reduce CO2 emissions and costs by adopting the shelved trolleys used in shipping FPD production  equipment to semiconductor production equipment, thereby improving the load factor of trucks. We are also pushing for  fewer resources to be used in packaging when shipping products. TEL constantly monitors and manages its use and release of any chemical substances used in product development and  manufacturing subject to the Japanese PRTR1 law. Whenever TEL introduces a new chemical substance or changes the  way an existing substance is used, we check for environmental, health, and safety risks beforehand. In response to the  Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbons, we conduct simple checks, regular inspections, and so on  based on law in an effort to monitor the amounts of fluorocarbons filled and recovered. In fiscal year 2020, none of our  factories or offices had fluorocarbon leakages requiring notification. In carrying out its business activities, the TEL group has a not insignificant impact on biodiversity, and yet without the  benefits yielded from biodiversity, we could not sustain its activities. In recognition of this, the group will develop a  framework for promoting initiatives to conserve biodiversity. In fiscal year 2020, we set a goal of conducting at least two  ecosystem tours or conservation activities at our factories and offices in Japan. A total of 18 events were held, attracting a  total of 368 participants. TEL began implementing its Green Procurement Guidelines in January 2001, and has since promoted green procurement,  prioritizing the purchase of environmentally friendly parts, products, and materials. Through these guidelines, we strive to  gain the understanding and cooperation of our suppliers with respect to building environmental management systems,  monitoring, reducing, and disclosing information on the environmental impacts of business activities; and developing  environmentally friendly products. In promoting initiatives for the environment, TEL maintains close communication with all its stakeholders. Our  environmental policy requires that we promote cooperative partnerships with our stakeholders, and respond  appropriately as a company to their expectations and wishes.  In fiscal year 2020, we revamped our online environmental education programs to better promote environmental  communication within us. Our online programs consist of an environmental program for new employees and mid-career  recruits, plus a refresher program for existing employees. In fiscal year 2020, more than 11,000 employees attended these  programs in Japan. In fiscal year 2021 and beyond, we plan to expand these education programs overseas. www.tel.com/csr/environment/green-procurement/ URL www.tel.com/csr/environment/product/ URL www.tel.com/csr/environment/office/ URL www.tel.com/csr/environment/office/ URL 1 PRTR (Pollutant Release  and Transfer Register): A  framework for tracking,  tabulating, and disclosing  quantitative data on  chemical substances  that may be hazardous  to human health and  the ecosystem, including  the amounts used and  discharged into the  environment and the  amounts transferred (as  part of waste) off the  original business’s premises The social contribution activities of Tokyo Electron (TEL) aim to contribute to the development of local communities and the resolution of  social issues through various initiatives while deepening relationships of trust with all stakeholders.

The Physics Challenge is a contest  offering a variety of programs that also  demonstrate the appeal of physics.  About 1,200 students took part in Round  1, with the top 100 going on to Round  2. Finally, five students were selected  to represent Japan in the International  Physics Olympiad 2020 in Lithuania. Tokyo Electron (Shanghai) participates in a public fun run hosted by the  Shanghai Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park. The event is held to promote health among  employees of companies in the area to build a mutually supportive community  through human connections. On  the day of the event, donations are  collected for the Giving Tree Community  Center Shanghai as well. In fiscal year  2020, 41 employees helped run the  event and also collected 8,000 yuan in  donations. In April 2019, as part of Earth Month, employees of Tokyo Electron America  held a cleanup of Rock Creek Park, located close to the Portland Branch Office,  and picked up rubbish along roads leading to the office. With park visitors also  participating on the day, about 30 people  collected 200 kg of waste and helped  maintain the beauty of the area. The event  offers a great opportunity to consider our  own communities and the environment. The Tohoku Forum for Creativity (TFC) is an  international visitor research institute located  within Tohoku University. TEL has been providing  comprehensive support to the TFC ever since the  House of Creativity was established in fiscal year  2014. The program theme adopted for fiscal year  2021 is “Designing the Human-Centric IoT Society,”  which was jointly proposed with the university.  Through this industry-academia cooperation,  research is being conducted to overcome challenges  expected in an Internet of Things (IoT) society,  and realize a future society centered on human well-being. The Kick-off  Symposium for this program was held in October 2019. Keep Portland Beautiful Companies Creating Forests—Afforestation activity U.S. Japan Tohoku Forum for Creativity: 2020 program activities TEL Robot Combat is a robot contest that has been held every year since  fiscal year 2017 for university students and graduate students specializing in  science and technology. One of the event sessions assesses each robot on  characteristics such as maneuverability,  stability, precision, and creativity, with  the design being assessed along with  performance. Through industry-academia  cooperation, TEL creates opportunities for  students to develop their skills and abilities  and provides opportunities for companies  and associations to exchange ideas. TEL’s domestic manufacturing facilities offer work experience programs every  year to help foster human resources and contribute to local communities.  These activities offer opportunities for participants to get a deeper  understanding of the roles of industry  and companies, and the significance of  work done there. The program focuses  specifically on actual business, including  factory tours and training on exchanging  business cards and other Japanese customs,  3D CAD design and wafer inspections, and  onsite lessons about logistics processes. Tokyo Electron Europe participates in Children in Need, a charity event held in  November every year to help improve the lives of sick children and children  with disabilities. Employees bake and  sell cakes within the company, and the  company adds a matching amount to the  money they raise, which is then donated  together. During fiscal year 2020, a Funny  Hats Competition was also held to build  excitement for the event. As part of an agreement with Oshu City in Iwate Prefecture to participate in its  Companies Creating Forests program, Tokyo Electron Technology Solutions plants  trees around its office in Iwate Prefecture. Participating in this activity for the ninth  time in fiscal year 2020, employees and family members cooperate each year  to plant about 700 seedlings. Conducted as part of environment conservation  and greening efforts in the surrounding area, pictures of these activities are also  published as an example  of CSR activities in the  social studies textbooks  of some junior high  schools.

Calculations for categories 8, 10, 13, 14, and 15 were not made as they are either not  included in TEL’s activities, or have already been included in other categories. 4 Scope 1: Non-energy-derived CO2 and greenhouse gases other than CO2.  Calculation method: Emissions = Σ (consumption × emission per unit consumption – amount recovered and properly treated) × global warming factor   Global warming factor is based on Japan’s Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures denotes data with third-party assurance.

Masahiko Sugiyama  Representative Director  Deloitte Tohmatsu Sustainability Co., Ltd.  3-2-3, Marunouchi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo      We have undertaken a limited assurance engagement of the CO2 Emissions from energy consumption in Japan, the  Water consumption in Japan, Female managers percentage in Japan and Annual paid leave take-up rate in Japan  indicated with for the year ended March 31, 2020 (the “Sustainability Information”) included in the “TOKYO  ELECTRON SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020” (the “Report”) of Tokyo Electron Ltd. (the “Company”).    The Company’s Responsibility  The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Information in accordance with the calculation  and reporting standard adopted by the Company (indicated with the Sustainability Information included in the  Report). CO2 quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty for reasons such as incomplete scientific knowledge  used to determine emissions factors and numerical data.    Our Independence and Quality Control  We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional  Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental  principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.  We apply International Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of  Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements, and accordingly maintain a  comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with  ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.    Our Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Sustainability Information based on the  procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement  in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (“ISAE”) 3000, Assurance Engagements  Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance  Standards Board (“IAASB”), ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the  IAASB and the Practical Guideline for the Assurance of Sustainability Information, issued by the Japanese  Association of Assurance Organizations for Sustainability Information.  The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of  processes performed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification  methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. These procedures also included  the following:   ・ Evaluating whether the Company’s methods for estimates are appropriate and had been consistently applied.  However, our procedures did not include testing the data on which the estimates are based or reperforming the  estimates.  ・ Performing interviews of responsible persons and inspecting documentary evidence to assess the completeness  of the data, data collection methods, source data and relevant assumptions applicable to the sites.    The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent  than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance  engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable  assurance engagement.    Limited Assurance Conclusion  Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention  that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with  the calculation and reporting standard adopted by the Company.

In the foundry  segment of the semiconductor industry, total revenue rose to  US$80 billion in 2020, a robust growth of 20% over 2019. 2.2.3 Industry Outlook, Opportunities and Threats Foundry Industry Demand and Supply Outlook For 2020, TSMC’s strong growth in the foundry segment  was driven by increased market demand for 5G smartphones  and high-performance computing (HPC) products such as  PCs, tablets, game consoles, servers, and 5G base station,  which were further boosted by increasing “shelter at home”  and “work from home” during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Meanwhile, to cope with high market demand and supply  uncertainties, the electronics supply chain took on higher  inventory levels, which also contributed to foundry and  TSMC growth. For 2021, TSMC forecasts further increases in  demand for overall electronics device, driven by the ongoing  5G smartphone ramp-up and continued strength in HPCs,  supporting the acceleration of digital transformation, resulting  in the total semiconductor market excluding memory to have  a low-teens growth. Over the longer term, fueled by increasing  semiconductor content in electronic devices, continued market  share gains by fabless companies, increases in integrated device  manufacturer (IDM) outsourcing, and expanding in-house  application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) from systems  companies, the Company expects foundry segment revenue  to outpace the mid-single-digit compound annual growth rate projected for the overall semiconductor market excluding  memory from 2020 through 2025. As an upstream supplier in the semiconductor supply chain, the  foundry segment is tightly correlated with the market health of  the major platforms, including smartphone, HPCs, Internet of  Things, automotive, and digital consumer electronics (DCE). ● Smartphones Smartphone unit shipments, which were down a modest  2% in 2019, declined again in 2020 by 9%, reflecting their  already high penetration in many developed countries and  China, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on  consumer purchasing power. With 5G commercialization  continuing to accelerate, new 5G smartphones will likely  shorten the overall replacement cycle. As a result, TSMC  projects a high-single-digit growth for the smartphone market  in 2021. Over the longer term, the migration to 5G, together  with improved performance, longer battery life, biosensors and  more AI features, will all continue to propel smartphone sales  going forward. ● High Performance Computing (HPC) The HPC platform includes PCs, tablets, game consoles, servers,  and base stations, etc. Major HPC unit shipments grew by  11% in 2020, mainly driven by the COVID-19 “stay at home  economy” and rapid 5G base station deployment. Low-power integrated circuit (IC) technology is an  essential requirement among handset manufacturers, and  system-on-chip (SoC) design is the preferred solution given  its optimized cost, power, and form factor (IC footprint  and thickness) potential. TSMC is the acknowledged leader  in process technology for manufacturing system-on-chip.  Spurred by the appetite for higher performance to run artificial  intelligence (AI) applications, various complex software  computation and higher resolution video, the migration to  advanced process technologies will continue to accelerate. The HPC market is projected to have a high-single-digit  unit growth in 2021, following its strong growth in 2020.  Several factors are expected to drive demand in the HPC  platform, including ongoing 5G base station deployment,  rising data center AI server demand, and next generation  game console ramping. All these require higher performance  and power-efficient CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, AI accelerators, and  related-ASICs, which will drive the overall HPC platform  towards richer silicon content and more advanced process  technologies. ● Internet of Things (IoT) The Internet of Things platform includes various types of  connected devices, such as smart wearables, smart speakers,  and surveillance systems. Boosted by pandemic-driven demand,  IoT unit shipments grew 17% in 2020, with Bluetooth  earphones, smart wearables, and smart health devices as the  major growth drivers. ● Automotive Worldwide car unit sales fell 14% in 2020 as global economies  were softened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Car unit sales are  projected to rebound, however, in 2021 with growth in the  low-teens driven by expected recovery in global economies and  the automotive market in particular.   Moving forward, TSMC expects semiconductor content  requirement, driven by electric vehicles (EVs), advanced driver  assistance systems (ADAS) and infotainment systems, to fuel  the demand for processors, sensors, analog and power ICs.  TSMC offers a wide variety of process technologies to help  customers compete and succeed in the automotive market. ● Digital Consumer Electronics (DCE) DCE unit shipments fell 7% in 2020. Sales of TVs and set-top  boxes exceeded expectation thanks to the “stay at home  economy”, but other consumer products such as digital  cameras continued to decline due to stagnant demand and  cannibalization by smartphones. Looking ahead to 2021, IoT unit shipments will grow about  30%, thanks to the continued momentum of Bluetooth  earphones, smart watches and smart speakers. In addition,  the pandemic is changing consumers’ life and working styles,  further triggering more applications for disease management  and prevention. By adding more AI functions, IoT devices will  drive demand for more powerful yet lower power-consuming  controllers, connectivity ICs and sensors. TSMC offers  high-performance yet low-power process technologies to meet  industry trends and help customers succeed in the marketplace. A slight rebound in the overall DCE market is expected in 2021  as certain sub-segments such as 4K and smart TVs continue  to show positive growth. In addition, AI functions such as  picture quality improvement and voice control are increasingly  incorporated in TVs. With a broad array of advanced  technology offerings, TSMC expects to take advantage of these  market trends.

We believe that the  basis for successful corporate governance is a sound and effective Board of Directors. In line with this principle, the TSMC Board  delegates various responsibilities and authority to two Board Committees, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. Each  Committee has a written charter approved by the Board. Each Committee’s chairperson regularly reports to the Board on the  activities and actions of the relevant committee. 3.2 Board of Directors Board Structure TSMC’s Board of Directors consists of ten distinguished members with a great breadth of experience as world-class business leaders  or professionals. We deeply rely on them for their diverse knowledge, personal perspectives, and solid business judgment. Six of  those ten members are Independent Directors: former British Telecommunications Chief Executive Officer, Sir Peter L. Bonfield;  Co-Founder, Chairman Emeritus of the Acer Group, Mr. Stan Shih; former Chairman of National Performing Arts Center and former  Advisor of Executive Yuan, R.O.C., Ms. Kok-Choo Chen; former Chairman of Applied Materials, Inc., Mr. Michael R. Splinter; former  Chief Executive Officer of Xilinx, Inc., Mr. Moshe N. Gavrielov; and currently Chairman of Delta Electronics Inc., Mr. Yancey Hai.  Independent Directors constitute 60% of the Board. TSMC’s Board is comprised of a diverse group of professionals from different backgrounds in industries, academia, law, etc. These  professionals include citizens from Taiwan, Europe and the U.S. with world-class business operating experience, one of whom is  female. Board Responsibilities Inheriting the spirit of TSMC’s Founder, Dr. Morris Chang’s  philosophy on corporate governance, under the leadership  of Chairman Dr. Mark Liu and CEO & Vice Chairman Dr. C.C.  Wei, TSMC’s Board of Directors takes a serious and forthright  approach to its duties and is a dedicated, competent and  independent Board. The Board’s primary duty is to supervise the Company’s  compliance with relevant laws and regulations, financial  transparency, timely disclosure of material information, and  maintaining of the highest integrity. TSMC’s Board of Directors  strives to perform these responsibilities through its Audit  Committee and the Compensation Committee, the hiring of  a financial expert consultant for the Audit Committee, and  coordination with our Internal Audit department. The second duty of the Board of Directors is to evaluate the  management’s performance and to appoint and dismiss  officers of the Company when necessary. TSMC’s management  has maintained a healthy and functional communication  with the Board of Directors, has been devoted in executing  guidance of the Board, and is dedicated in running the  business operations, all to achieve the best interests for TSMC  shareholders. The third duty of the Board of Directors is to resolve important,  concrete matters, such as capital appropriations, investment  activities, dividends, etc. The fourth duty of the Board of Directors is to provide  guidance to the management team of the Company. Quarterly,  TSMC’s management reports to the Board on a variety of  subjects (including CSR/ESG programs). The management also  reviews the Company’s business strategies with the Board and  updates TSMC’s Board on the progress of those strategies,  obtaining Board guidance as appropriate. Nomination and Election of Directors TSMC envisions the membership of its esteemed Board of  Directors to be composed of highly ethical professionals with  the necessary knowledge, experience and understanding  from diverse backgrounds. TSMC established “Guidelines for  Nomination of Directors”, which describes the procedures and  criteria for the nomination, qualification and evaluation of  candidates for Directors. In addition, TSMC envisions its Board  to be composed of a majority of independent directors, with  the independence of each independent director candidate  considered and assessed under relevant laws. TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation also state that not more  than 0.3 percent of our annual profits may be distributed  as compensation to our directors. In addition, directors  who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not  entitled to receive any director compensation. According to  TSMC’s Compensation Committee Charter, the distribution  of compensation to directors shall be made in accordance  with TSMC’s “Rules for Distribution of Compensation to  Directors” based on the following principles: (1) directors  who also serve as executive officers of the Company are not  entitled to receive compensation; (2) the compensation for  independent directors may be higher than other directors, as  all independent directors also serve as members of the Audit  Committee and Compensation Committee and thus participate  in the discussions as well as resolutions of related committee  meetings in accordance with the charter of each committee;  and (3) the compensation for overseas independent directors  may be higher than domestic independent directors, as they  require additional time to attend quarterly meetings in Taiwan. Directors shall be elected pursuant to the candidate nomination  system specified in Article 192-1 of the R.O.C. Company Law.  The tenure of office for Directors shall be three years. The  independence of each independent director candidate is also  considered and assessed under relevant law such as the Taiwan  “Regulations Governing Appointment of Independent Directors  and Compliance Matters for Public Companies”. Under R.O.C.  law, in which TSMC was incorporated, any shareholders  holding one percent or more of our total outstanding  common shares may nominate their own candidate to stand  for election as a Board member. This democratic mechanism  allows our shareholders to become involved in the selection  and nomination process of Board candidates. The final slate of  candidates is put to the shareholders for voting at the relevant  annual shareholders’ meeting. There are no limits on the number of terms that a director may  serve. We believe the Company benefits from the contributions  of directors who have over their years of dedicated service  acquired unique insights into the operations and financial  developments of the Company. The Company reviews the  appropriateness of each director’s continued service to ensure  there are new viewpoints available to the Board. Directors’ Compensation According to TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation, the Board  of Directors is authorized to determine the salary for the  Chairman, Vice Chairman and Directors, taking into account  the extent and value of the services provided for the  management of the Corporation and the standards of the  industry within the R.O.C. and overseas.

TSMC strictly  adheres to the highest standards of integrity and promotes  good ethical behavior to sustain the hard-earned trust and  confidence of its shareholders, customers, suppliers, employees  and the general public – constantly and vigilantly promoting  integrity, fairness, and transparency in all that we say and do.  We have zero tolerance for corruption, refrain from bribery,  fraud, waste of corporate assets, and prohibit the advancement  of personal interests at the expense of or in conflict with  TSMC. At the heart of our corporate governance culture is the  “TSMC Ethics and Business Conduct Policy” (Ethics Code). The  Ethics Code requires that each employee bear a heavy personal  responsibility to preserve and to protect TSMC’s ethical values  and reputation. At the same time, we have formulated the  “TSMC’s Supplier Code of Conduct” as well to ensure our  suppliers understand and follow the Ethics Code and together  fulfill our corporate social responsibilities. ● Do not undertake any practices detrimental to TSMC, to the  environment, or to society; ● Procure all of our raw materials from socially responsible  sources; ● Protect proprietary information of TSMC, our customers and  suppliers; and ● Abide by the letter of all applicable laws, rules and  regulations. Intellectual Property Protection: In order to build and sustain  an environment of innovation, technology leadership, and  sustainable profitable growth, the Ethics Code requires  that TSMC promotes business relationships founded upon  an unwavering respect for the intellectual property rights,  proprietary information and trade secrets of TSMC, our  customers, and others. are responsible for the full, fair, accurate, timely, and  understandable financial accounting and financial disclosure  in reports and documents filed by the Company with securities  authorities and in all TSMC public communications and  disclosures. TSMC has a variety of measures in place to ensure  compliance with these disclosure obligations. Any modification to the Ethics Code requires the approval of  our Audit Committee to ensure our ethics compliance program  is independently reviewed against corporate best practices. Ethics Code Implementation High Standard Ethical Culture: Our ethics program is  implemented in four ways by all of TSMC’s employees, officers  and Board members. First, TSMC’s management sets the “tone  from the top” by acting in accordance with the Ethics Code  so that they may be an example to all stakeholders. Second,  working-level managers are responsible for ensuring their  staff’s understanding of and compliance with applicable rules  and regulations. Third, TSMC encourages an environment of  open communications in discussing any questions related to  the Ethics Code. Any employee may consult his or her direct  supervisors, Human Resources or Legal to obtain timely advice.  Lastly, TSMC requires all employees to stay vigilant and report  any noncompliance by anyone to their supervisors, the function  head of Human Resources, the responsible corporate senior  management appointed by CEO that oversees the Ombudsman  system, or to the Chairman of the Company’s Audit Committee  directly. Self-Assessment of All Departments and Employees:  Self-assessment of all departments and employees is an  important part of our ethics compliance program. All  departments and subsidiaries of TSMC are required to conduct  Control Self-Assessment (CSA) tests annually to review  employees’ awareness of the Ethics Code. The CSA results are  reviewed to track the results of our compliance program. In  addition, all employees must disclose any matters that cause,  or may cause, actual or potential conflict of interest. In addition  to this proactive disclosure requirement, employees with  specific job grades or job responsibilities must annually declare  any relationships that may constitute a conflict of interest,  which enables TSMC to take necessary arrangements and  report the results to the Audit Committee. Internal Auditing: The Internal Auditor of TSMC plays a critical  role in ensuring the Company’s compliance with the Ethics  Code and relevant rules and regulations. To ensure that our financial, managerial, and operating information is accurate, reliable, and timely and that our employees’ actions are in compliance  with applicable policies, standards, procedures, laws and regulations, our Internal Auditor conducts audits of various control points  within the Company in accordance with its annual audit plan approved by the Board of Directors and subsequently reports its audit  findings and remedial issues to the Board and management on a regular basis. Training and Promotion: To promote awareness to our employees of their responsibilities under the Ethics Code, we publish  our Ethics Code and related policies and documents on our intranet and, provide training courses, posters, and emails. In terms  of training courses, TSMC not only provides annual online course on the Ethics Code and requires all employees to complete the  training, as well as face-to-face training courses delving into more specific ethics-related topics for targeted employees. In 2020,  there were about 50,482 attendances that completed ethics-related training courses at TSMC and its subsidiaries. TSMC not only  provides annual online courses on professional ethics and requires colleagues to complete the training. In addition to our internal compliance efforts, we expect and assist our business partners such as customers and suppliers, and any  other entities with whom we deal (include consultants or third party agents who act for or on behalf of TSMC) to recognize and  understand TSMC’s ethical standards to fulfill our responsibilities as a corporate citizen. For instance, we require all of our suppliers  to declare in writing that they will respect and comply with TSMC’s ethical standards and culture. TSMC is a full member of the  Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”, formerly the (Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, EICC)), dedicated to electronics supply  chain sustainability. In addition to adopting the RBA Code of Conduct at all of its facilities, TSMC applied the RBA’s standards to  enhance our audit program of our suppliers and relevant business partners. We provide training and communicate our ethical  culture to our suppliers through live seminars to prevent any unethical conduct and detect any sign of Ethics Code violations. In  2020, we held both a sustainable supply chain experience exchange and our annual Responsible Supply Chain Forum to share/ exchange practical experiences on topics such as the Ethics Code, labor rights, environmental protection, and occupational safety.  In total, 518 attendees from 337 suppliers participated in these activities. We also exchange views on appropriate business conduct  and TSMC’s ethical standards and implementation status with our customers as part of customer audit programs. Reporting Channels and Whistleblower Protection To ensure that our conduct meets relevant legal requirements and the highest ethical standards under the Ethics Code, TSMC  provides multiple channels for reporting business conduct concerns. First of all, our Audit Committee approved and we have  implemented the “Complaint Policy and Procedures for Certain Accounting and Legal Matters” and “Procedures for Ombudsman  System” that allow employees or any whistleblowers with relevant evidence to report any financial, legal, or ethical irregularities  anonymously through either the Ombudsman or directly to the Audit Committee. TSMC maintains additional internal reporting  channels for our employees. To foster an open culture of ethics compliance, we encourage our employees and the third parties we  do business with to report any suspected noncompliance with law or relevant TSMC policy. TSMC treats any complaint and the investigation thereof in a confidential and sensitive manner, and strictly prohibits any form of  retaliation against any individual who in good faith reports or helps with the investigation of any complaint. Due to the open reporting channels, TSMC receives reports on various issues from employees and external parties such as our  customers and suppliers from time to time.

Note 2: Others mainly include revenue associated with packaging and testing services, mask making, design services, and royalties. 5.1.4 Production in 2020 and 2019 5.2 Technology Leadership 5.2.1 R&D Organization and Investment In 2020, TSMC continued to invest in research and  development, with total R&D expenditures amounting to 8.2%  of revenue, a level that equals or exceeds the R&D investment  of many other leading high-tech companies. Faced with the increasingly difficult challenge to continue  extending Moore’s Law, which calls for the doubling of  semiconductor computing power every two years, TSMC has  focused its R&D efforts on offering customers first-to-market,  leading-edge technologies and design solutions that contribute  to their product success. In 2020, following the transfer to  manufacturing of 5nm technology, the Company’s R&D  organization continued to fuel the pipeline of technological  innovation needed to maintain industry leadership. While  TSMC’s 3nm technology, the sixth generation platform to  make use of 3D transistors, continues full development with  major customers completed IP design and started silicon  validation, the Company has proceeded into full development  of 2nm technology, which is the leading edge technology  in the semiconductor industry today. At the same time, the  Company’s research and pathfinding pushed forward with  exploratory studies for nodes beyond 2nm. In addition to complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor  (CMOS) logic, TSMC conducts R&D on a wide range of other  semiconductor technologies that provide the functionalities  required by customers for mobile SoC and other applications.  Highlights in 2020 include: substrate (CoWoS®) with record-breaking Si interposer area  up to 2,400mm2, which is equivalent to the size of three full  reticles. Qualification completion is targeted in the first half  of 2021 package-on-package (InFO-PoP) Gen-5 packaging for mobile  application processors and successfully qualified InFO-PoP  Gen-6 for mobile applications with enhanced thermal  performance In 2020, TSMC maintained strong partnerships with many  world-class research institutions, including SRC in the U.S.  and IMEC in Belgium. The Company also continued to expand  research collaboration with leading universities throughout  the world for two grand purposes: the advancement of  semiconductor technologies and the nurturing of human talent  for the future. ● 3nm Technology In 2020, TSMC focused on the manufacturing baseline  process setup, yield learning, transistor and interconnect R/C  performance improvement, and reliability evaluation of 3nm  technology, which offers significant density improvement  with better performance at same power or lower power  consumption at comparable performance compared to 5nm  technology. During the year, major customers completed IP  design and started silicon validation. TSMC plans to complete  3nm technology qualification for risk production in 2021. ● 2nm Technology In 2020, following initial research and pathfinding,  TSMC proceeded into the development stage of 2nm  technology, focusing on testkey and test vehicle design and  implementation, mask making and Si pilot runs. ● Lithography Technology The focus for R&D lithography in 2020 was on 3nm and  2nm technology development and preparation of technology  development of next-generation nodes and beyond. In 3nm  technology development, EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography  showed good imaging capability with expected wafer yield.  TSMC R&D is working on reduction of mask defects in EUV  scanner and overlay errors while lowering overall cost. In  2021, TSMC will focus intensely on improving EUV quality and  reducing costs in 2nm technology and beyond. In 2020, the Company’s EUV program made continuous  improvement in light-source power and stability, enabling  faster learning rates and process development for advanced  nodes. Additional progress was made with resist process,  pellicle, and related mask blanks.

In  2020, the R&D organization successfully completed 3nm node  mask technology development, which largely implemented  complicated and advanced EUV mask technology. Continuous  advancement of EUV mask technology was made to meet  mask requirements for 2nm node lithography. 5.2.2 R&D Accomplishments in 2020 Highlights Integrated Interconnect and Packaging Wafer level system integration (WLSI) technologies have  evolved quickly with various platforms mixed and matched  in increasingly complex application scenarios. All such TSMC-SoICTM is an innovative wafer-level frontend 3DIC  chip stacking platform with outstanding bonding density,  interconnect bandwidth, power efficiency, and thin profile.  It extends Moore’s Law through system-level scaling with  sustainable performance gains and cost benefits. A SoIC  integrated chip can be subsequently assembled using  conventional packages or using TSMC’s new 3DFabricTM  technologies, such as CoWoS or InFO, for next generation  HPC, AI and mobile applications. Currently, TSMC has  achieved process validation for both CoW and WoW stacking  using micron-level bonding-pitch processes with promising  electrical yield and reliability results. TSMC will keep pursuing  the scaling of SoIC technologies to align with the Company’s  other advanced Si technologies for further improved transistor  density, system power, performance, and area (PPA), and cost  competitiveness. technologies come under the umbrella of wafer level  integration, which TSMC has named 3DFabricTM for its  enablement of fine pitch chip-to-chip connection and a unified  fabrication philosophy leveraging existing wafer processes.  Under 3DFabricTM, all processes with chips that are embedded  before interconnection are called Integrated Fan-Out (InFO),  while all processes that start with making re-distribution  interconnection (RDL) followed by chip placement onto  pre-made RDL are called CoWoS®. This new nomenclature  more accurately reflects the nature of the processes involved  and points to their future technology paths. Along with  their siblings, SoIC, system-on-wafer (SoW), and system- on-integrated-substrate (SoIS), they form a universal WLSI  technology family that will lead the industry in meeting the  future scaling needs as required by increasingly challenging  and more diversified computing systems integration. ● Chip-Last CoWoS®  CoWoS® with Si interposer is the leading 2.5D technology for  high-end HPC and AI product applications. The technology  features a large Si interposer with sub-micron routing layers  and iCap (integrated capacitors), so that various chiplets such  as SoC and high bandwidth memory (HBM) can be placed on  it. The CoWoS® Gen-5 now under development has displayed  a record-breaking Si interposer area up to 2,400mm2, which is  equivalent in size to three full reticles. Qualification completion  is targeted in the first half of 2021. Corporate Research Innovation in devices and materials continues to drive higher  performance and reduced power consumption in advanced  logic technologies. In 2020, TSMC stayed at the forefront  of 2D and carbon nanotube (CNT) transistor research.  TSMC successfully demonstrated a process to synthesize  one-atomic-layer thick, single-crystal, hexagonal boron nitride  (hBN) on full 2-inch wafers, a significant achievement as hBN  has been shown to be an ideal passivation layer for 2D device  channels. This outstanding fundamental research result was  published in the March 2020 issue of Nature, one of the  world’s leading science journals. At the 2020 Symposia on VLSI Technology, TSMC  demonstrated the highest nFET current for 2D-FETs at a drain  voltage of 1V, with CVD MoS2 monolayer channel. And at  the 2020 International Electron Device Meeting, the Company  introduced a novel interfacial layer dielectric (ILX), which could  nucleate on CNT a continuous sub-0.5nm thickness film, which  allows growth of high-k gate dielectric (hafnium oxide) on CNT mobile applications and InFO-oS Gen-2 for HPC chip-partition  applications. InFO-PoP Gen-6 was also successfully qualified  for mobile applications and displayed enhanced thermal  performance. InFO-oS Gen-3, which provides more  chip-partition integration with larger package size and higher  bandwidth, was developed on schedule. To meet demand of  HPC applications, TSMC developed ultra-high bandwidth InFO  Local Silicon Interconnect (InFO_LSI) technology, in which  SoC chiplets are integrated into a 3D InFO package through  ultra-high density local Si interconnects (LSI). InFO without  substrate, which uses multi-die heterogeneous integration  and finer-pitch die-to-die interconnection, was successfully  qualified for consumer applications. The newest generation IPD  (integrated passive device) technology, which provides higher  density capacitors and low ESL (effective series inductance)  for improved electrical performance, passed qualification on  InFO-PoP. This enhanced InFO-PoP will benefit both AI and 5G  mobile applications. High volume manufacturing of the newest  IPD is scheduled to begin in 2021. ● Advanced Interconnect TSMC provides innovative technologies to enable  small-dimensional interconnect and boost chip performance.   In 2020, a brand-new hybrid interconnect was proposed as a  future interconnect architecture.

Developing innovative solutions such as these  helps TSMC maintain its global technology leadership. by conventional ALD. Enabled by this novel ILX, top-gate CNT  transistors with gate length down to 15nm were demonstrated  with nearly ideal gate control. TSMC continues to search and explore emerging high-density,  non-volatile memory hardware accelerators for AI and HPC  applications. The Company’s corporate research is well  positioned to pave the way for continued node-to-node density  scaling, performance enhancement, and power reduction as it  has done in the past. ● Mixed Signal/Radio Frequency (MS/RF)  In 2020, TSMC developed a 3nm silicon proof and EM  simulation-based LC tank design to facilitate high-speed SerDes  (serializer/deserializer) circuit design with various metal scheme  options and layout specifications with shortened design  turnaround time. 2020 marked the first year that the end-users  began enjoying the benefit of high speed, low latency and  massive IoT in the 5G network roadmap. To improve the  cost–benefit ratio of 5G, TSMC provided various 7nm and  6nm RF devices for customer transceiver designs. To boost  performance in RF switching, TSMC developed a 40nm special  process for 5G RF FEM (frontend module) design in sub-6 GHz  applications. To accommodate higher frequencies, TSMC also  developed a N28HPC+ process for enhancing power amplifier  performance in 5G mmWave FEM designs. ● Power IC/Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD)  TSMC expanded the 12-inch BCD technology portfolio on  90nm, 55nm and 22nm in 2020, targeting a variety of  fast-growing applications for mobile power management  ICs with various levels of integration. This included dedicated  optimized 5V power switches to handle increasing power  demands driven by Li-ion batteries. 90nm BCD technology  covers wide spectrum of applications from 5V to 35V and will  be continuously expanded in 2021. ● Panel Drivers  In 2020, TSMC developed wafer-on-wafer stacking (WoW  28HPC/40HV) with stable product yield comparable to  28HPC+ with 60% active power reduction. In addition, 28HV  monolithic technology completed customer IP verification,  qualification and 128Mb SRAM yield verification. These  technologies are leading-edge for small panel 4K resolution,  OLED (organic light-emitting diode) and 120Hz display driver  ICs. Furthermore, TSMC completed OLED on Si product qualification and moved to mass production for AR/VR  applications with excellent yield and illumination uniformity.   In 2021, TSMC plans to offer an improved version of this  technology and deploy 8V transistors for WoW stacking  efficiency that will mean enhanced performance and cost  reduction for OLED TDDI (touch with display driver integration)  applications on 28HV. ● Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS)  TSMC’s modular MEMS technology was qualified for  mass production of high-resolution accelerometers and  gyroscopes in 2020.

To continuously reduce product defects, enhance process controls, make early detection of abnormalities and prevent quality  problems that affect customers, Q&R collaborates with other operational entities to establish real-time defense systems using  advanced statistical methods and quality tools. Since 2017, the Company’s Q&R and fabs have worked together on enhancements  for automotive product quality improvement, including design rule implementation and migration to Automotive Quality System  2.0. This covers process capability requirement tightening for in-line and wafer acceptance testing in fabs and the handling of  maverick wafers and lots. Q&R also provides dedicated resources for field/line return analysis and timely physical failure analysis (PFA)  for process improvement to meet automotive customers’ stringent DPPM (defective parts per million) requirements. To stimulate employee problem-solving and develop related quality systems and methodologies, Q&R held several company-wide  symposia and training programs on total quality excellence (TQE), design of experiment (DOE), statistical process control (SPC),  metrology and deep machine learning, and quality audit in 2020. These included the promotion and training of deep machine  learning, which was successfully applied to automatic classification of wafer defects and advanced spectral analysis to detect  differences among processes and equipment so that corrective actions could be initiated. Furthermore, deep machine learning was  also used to analyze the correlation between raw materials and TSMC process parameters for the first time and to successfully block problematic raw materials. In 2021, Q&R will continue the  development of employee capabilities by promoting quality  methods and professional trainings and applying deep machine  learning to enhance TSMC competitiveness. For raw material and supplier management, Q&R and the  material management organization collaborate to enhance the  inspection capability for incoming material quality and supplier  management. A raw material quality improvement task force  works with suppliers, and raw material quality checks have  been added to critical control points of the production line.  Q&R has also required suppliers to apply statistical process  methods to strictly control the stability of their own process  quality and enhance upstream raw material analysis. Q&R  requests that supply chain factories seek ISO 9001 certification,  implement process change management and evaluation,  and undertake quality audits. In 2020, Q&R set up a new  laboratory dedicated to advanced material analysis to enhance  the capability of raw material inspection and speed up the  root cause investigation for abnormal material events. In the  meantime, Q&R is developing a raw materials’ fingerprinting  database to further enhance TSMC’s control and analysis  capability for any raw material’s basic characteristics. Q&R is committed to “green manufacturing” and “responsible  supply chain” practices and collaborates with the corporate  ESH organization to ask suppliers to document that their  materials comply with international regulation for carcinogenic,  mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR) substances and to classify all  risky materials and carry out sampling tests. In 2020, Q&R had  100% inspection capability for CMR substances and shared  the inspection methods and skills with major material suppliers  to enhance monitoring of hazardous substances and control  capability in supply chain. Furthermore, Q&R also works with  operational entities for the recycling and reuse of chemical  acids and successfully achieved several impurity reductions  in recycling chemical acids during 2020. In 2021, Q&R will  continue sharing its technical knowledge to assist chemical  suppliers for developing further recycling and reuse projects  to achieve TSMC’s quality requirements and the sustainable  goal of friendly environment. Q&R is also committed to  the continual improvement of local supply chains and  developing local talents.

The risk management  organization periodically briefs the Audit Committee on the  ever-changing risk environment facing TSMC, the key points  of the Company’s enterprise risk management, and risk  assessment and mitigation efforts. The Audit Committee’s  Chairperson also reports to the Board of Directors on the risk  environment and risk mitigation actions to be taken. TSMC and its subsidiaries are committed to proactively  and cost effectively integrating and managing strategic,  operational, financial and hazardous risks that represent  potential negative consequences to operations and financial  results. TSMC operates an enterprise risk management (ERM)  program based on both its corporate vision and its long-term,  sustainable responsibility to both industry and society. ERM  seeks to provide the appropriate management of risks on  behalf of all stakeholders. The Company maintains a risk map  that assesses likelihood and impact severity of risk events on  the Company’s operation, and is used to identify and prioritize  risk controls and implement various controls and treatment  strategies in response to risks as they are identified. ● Sales and purchasing concentration ● Information security ● Intellectual property rights Operational Perspective 6.2.5 Long-term Equity Investment Policy and Results TSMC’s long-term equity investments accounted for using  equity method were all made for strategic purposes. In 2020,  the gains from these investments amounted to NT$3,592,818  thousand on a consolidated basis, increasing from the previous  year mainly due to increases in product demand and the mass  production of new products. In the future, TSMC’s long-term  equity investments accounted for using equity method will  continue to focus on strategic purposes through prudent  assessments. To mitigate the operational impacts of crisis events, ERM  conducts pre-crisis risk assessment and identifies feasible  strategies for crisis prevention. Response procedures and  recovery plans are established corresponding to different  scenarios. For specific severe crisis events involving multiple  TSMC manufacturing sites, the cross-functional central crisis  command center composed of operations and support functions is responsible for giving directions and internal  coordination to speed up response time and proactively  communicate with stakeholders. To raise risk awareness and  strengthen risk management culture in TSMC, RM task forces  have been formed to enhance risk assessment and conduct  crisis response exercises for potential critical events such as fire,  earthquake, IT service disruption, IT security breach, supply  chain disruption, major yield loss, and utility supply disruption.  In order to continuously mitigate corporate risks, crisis response  exercises are used to test the integrity of ERM and effectiveness  of risk controls. To mitigate supply chain disruption risks, TSMC has created  a task force comprised of members from fab operations,  materials management, risk management and quality systems  management to work with suppliers to develop business  continuity plans and enhance supply chain resilience. Partly as  a result of these efforts, there were no interruptions in TSMC’s  supply chain in 2020. As production capacity continues to expand with more  advanced technology, TSMC has initiated and implemented  seismic protection engineering design, risk treatment practices  and green manufacturing projects during the design phase of  all new fabs. 6.3.1 Risk Management Organization Chart TSMC’s risk management organization reports annually to the  Audit Committee on the risk environment TSMC faces, the key  points of enterprise risk management, and risk assessment  and mitigation efforts. The Audit Committee Chairperson also  reports to the Board on these discussions and actions. ● Industry Developments   The electronics industries and semiconductor market  are cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid  fluctuations in product demand, which could impact TSMC’s  semiconductor foundry business. Variations in order levels from  customers may result in volatility in the Company’s revenue and  earnings. 6.3.2 Strategic Risks From time to time, the electronics and semiconductor  industries have experienced significant, and occasionally  prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because  TSMC is, and will continue to be, dependent on the  requirements of electronics and semiconductor companies  for its services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the  general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to  reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services,  including TSMC’s services. If TSMC cannot take appropriate  actions such as reducing its costs to sufficiently offset declines  in demand, the Company’s revenue, margin, and earnings will  likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity. ● Changes in Technology The semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly  changing. TSMC competes by developing process technologies  using increasingly advanced nodes and on manufacturing  products with more functions. The Company also competes  by developing new derivative technologies. If TSMC does  not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly  develop new and innovative technologies, or the Company’s  competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional  technologies, TSMC may not be able to provide foundry  services on competitive terms. In addition, TSMC’s customers  have significantly decreased the time in which their products  or services are launched into the market. If TSMC is unable  to meet these shorter product time-to-market, it risks losing  these customers. These factors have also been intensified by  the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven  products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition  and concentration of customers (all further discussed among  these risk factors). Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced  technologies also impose challenges for achieving expected  product quality and product yield. If TSMC fails to maintain  quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost,  as well as loss of business or customer trust. For example,  in January 2019, the Company discovered yield problems in  12-nanometer and 16-nanometer wafers caused by a batch of  photoresist, which resulted in delayed delivery of products and  had a negative effect on TSMC’s gross margin and operating  margin in the first quarter of 2019. To reduce future risks of  such incidences, the Company has since strengthened inline  wafer inspection and tightened control of incoming material  to deal with the increasing complexity of leading-edge  technologies. If TSMC is unable to innovate new technologies  that meet the demand of its customers or overcome the above  factors, it may become less competitive and its revenue may  decline significantly. Regarding the response measures for the above-mentioned  risks, please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and  Strategy” on pages 15-17 of this annual report. Risks Associated with Decrease in Demand and Average  Selling Price A vast majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from  customers who use TSMC products in smartphones, high  performance computing (HPC), Internet of Things (IoT),  automotive electronics, and digital consumer electronics  (DCE). Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of  such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the  demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC products and services, could adversely affect  the Company’s revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing  facilities require substantial investment to construct and are  largely fixed-cost assets once they are in operation. Because  the Company owns most of its manufacturing capacities, a  significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general,  these costs do not decline when customer demand or our  capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer  demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease our  margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory  utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased  output, which can improve our margins. In addition, the  historical and current trend of declining average selling  prices (or “ASP”) of end use applications places downward  pressure on the prices of the components that go into such  applications. If the ASP of end use applications continues  decreasing, the pricing pressure on components produced  by TSMC may lead to a reduction of its revenue, margin and  earnings. Risks Associated with Competition The markets for TSMC’s foundry services are highly competitive.  The Company competes with other foundry service providers,  as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers.  Some of these companies may have access to more advanced  technologies than TSMC. Other companies may have greater  financial and other resources than TSMC, such as the possibility  of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic  stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable  to TSMC. For example, Chinese companies are expected to be  key players for new semiconductor fab development and fab  equipment spending in part due to various incentives provided  by the Chinese government. Furthermore, the Company’s competitors may, from time to  time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in  one or several technology nodes. These competitive activities  may decrease TSMC’s customer base, or its ASP, or both. If  TSMC is unable to compete effectively with these new and  aggressive competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity,  product quality and customer satisfaction, it risks losing  customers to these new contenders. Risks Associated with Changes in the Government  Policies and Regulatory Environment TSMC management closely monitors all domestic and foreign  government policies and regulations that might impact its  business and financial condition. During 2020 and as of  the date of this Annual Report, there were no government  policies or regulatory changes would materially impact TSMC’s  operations or financial condition. 114 115 6.3.3 Operational Risks Risks Associated with Capacity Expansion TSMC performs long-term market demand forecast for its  products and services to manage its overall capacity. Based  on market demand forecasts, TSMC has continued to add  capacity to meet market needs for its products and services.  Currently, TSMC’s capacity expansion plans include installing  and increasing production capacity, mainly for 5-nanometer  and 3-nanometer nodes, expanding its production facilities  in the Southern Taiwan Science Park and building a 300mm  wafer fab in Arizona. Implementing these capacity expansion plans will increase  its costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example,  the Company would need to build new facilities, purchase  additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate  the new equipment. If TSMC does not increase its net revenue  accordingly, its financial performance may be adversely  affected by these increased costs. In addition, market conditions are dynamic and TSMC’s market  demand forecast may change significantly at any time. During  periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines  or tools in some of the Company’s manufacturing facilities  may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if  subsequent demand increases rapidly over a short period  of time, TSMC may not be able to restore the capacity in  a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such  circumstances, its financial performance and competitiveness  may be adversely affected. In order to mitigate the risk associated with capacity expansion,  TSMC continuously watches for changes in market conditions  and works closely with its customers. When market demand  is not as expected, the Company tries to adjust its capacity  plans in a timely manner to reduce the impact on its financial  performance. Risks Associated with Sales Concentration Over the years, TSMC’s customer profile and the nature of the  Company’s customers’ business have changed dramatically.  While the Company generates revenue from hundreds of  customers worldwide, TSMC’s ten largest customers in 2018,  2019 and 2020 accounted for approximately 68%, 71% and  74% of TSMC’s net revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s  largest customer in 2018, 2019 and 2020 accounted for  approximately 22%, 23% and 25% of the Company’s net  revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s second largest customer for each particular year accounted for less than 10% of its net  revenue in 2018, 14% and 12% of its net revenue in 2019 and  2020, respectively. A more concentrated customer base will subject TSMC’s  revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from the Company’s  large customers and cause different seasonal patterns of the  Company’s business. This customer concentration results in  part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry  with the structural shift to mobile devices and applications  and software that provide the content for such devices. There  are only a limited number of customers who are successfully  exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, TSMC has seen the changes of nature in the Company’s  customers’ business models in response to this new business  model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend toward  the system companies developing their own designs and  working directly with semiconductor foundries, which makes  their products and services more marketable in a changing  consumer market. Also, since the global semiconductor  industry is becoming increasingly competitive, some of TSMC’s  customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order  to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the  form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of TSMC’s major  customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall  number of the Company’s customer pool. In addition,  regulatory restrictions such as export control directed at  TSMC’s major customers could impact the Company’s ability to  supply products to those customers, reduce those customers’  demand for TSMC’s products and services and impact their  business operations. The loss of, or significant curtailment of  purchases by, one or more of the Company’s top customers,  including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures,  industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory  restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing policies  or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer  or distributor inventory adjustments, or change in its major  customers’ business models may adversely affect TSMC’s results  of operations and financial condition. ● Raw Materials TSMC’s production operations require that it obtain  adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers,  gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis and at  commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in  the supply of some materials, whether by specific vendors  or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in Given that qualified backup suppliers are hard to find, TSMC  engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on  managing quality and capacity issues to be prepared for any  unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production when  the Company lacks sufficient time to re-tune its production  process. For leading technology nodes, TSMC not only adopts  world-class processes and facilities but also requires world-class  materials. To streamline supply chain risk management, the  Company has increased supplier site audits and meetings to  extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers.  In addition, in response to the rapid increase or decrease in  production capacity of new products, TSMC has continued  to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more  accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain  maintains sufficient inventory levels. The Company has  established a supply chain risk assessment to ensure critical  suppliers meet standards in labor, ethics, ESH (Environmental,  Safety and Health) and BCP (Business Continuity Plan). Onsite  audits are conducted regularly to empower these suppliers  to take responsibility for their supply chain as any regulatory  violations or adverse environmental impact event, or failure  to meet sustainability requirements could result in business  reduction or termination. occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays.  Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political  or economic turmoil occurring within the country of origin of  such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability  of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since TSMC  procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers,  there is a risk that the Company’s needs for such raw materials  may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily  available. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in  increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due  to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. TSMC’s  revenue and earnings could decline if the Company is unable  to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials  in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the  costs of raw materials. To reduce the supply chain risk and to  manage the cost effectively, TSMC commits resources toward  developing new supply sources. In addition, the Company  continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply  chain risk by decentralizing production plants and to improve  their cost competitiveness by moving their production facilities  to Taiwan from higher-cost areas. equipment and related services from a limited number of  suppliers in a market that is characterized from time to time  by limited supply and long delivery cycles. During such times,  supplier-specific or industry-wide lead times for delivery can  be as long as six months or more. To better manage its supply  chain, the Company has implemented various business models  and risk management contingencies with suppliers to shorten  the procurement lead time. Further, growing complexities,  especially in advanced lithographic technologies, may delay  the timely availability of the equipment and parts needed to  exploit time-sensitive business opportunities and also increase  the market price for such equipment and parts. Additionally,  ongoing trade tensions or protectionist measures could result  in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment,  including as a result of necessary export licenses being delayed  or denied, additional export control measures, and other tariff  or non-tariff barriers. If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in  a timely manner to fulfill its customers’ demand on technology  and production capacity, or at a reasonable cost, its financial  condition and results of operations could be negatively  impacted. Risks Associated with IT Security Even though TSMC has established a comprehensive internet  and computing security network, it cannot guarantee  that its computing systems which control or maintain vital  corporate functions, such as its manufacturing operations  and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune  to crippling cyberattacks by any third party attempting to  gain unauthorized access to its internal network systems, to  sabotage its operations and goodwill or otherwise. In the event  of a serious cyberattack, TSMC’s systems may lose important  corporate data or its production lines may be shut down  pending the resolution of such attack. While TSMC seeks to  continuously review and assess its cybersecurity policies and  procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, the  Company cannot guarantee that it will not be susceptible to  new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape  of cybersecurity threats. Hackers behind these cyberattacks may  also attempt to steal TSMC trade secrets and other sensitive  information, such as proprietary information of its customers  and other stakeholders and personal information of its  employees. Malicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses,  corrupted software or ransomware into TSMC’s network  systems to disrupt our operations, blackmail the Company  to regain control of our computing systems, or spy on it  for sensitive information. These attacks may result in TSMC having to pay damages for its delayed or disrupted orders  or incur significant expenses in implementing remedial and  improvement measures to enhance its cybersecurity network,  and may also expose the Company to significant legal liabilities  arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory  investigations associated with, among other things, leakage  of employee, customer or third-party information which the  company has an obligation to keep confidential. In the past, TSMC experienced and may in the future be subject  to attack by malicious software contained in the equipment the  Company purchases and installs. TSMC has implemented and  continually updated rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent  and minimize harm caused by such attacks. These measures  include advanced virus scanning tools to prevent a fab from  installing virus-infected tools, strengthening firewall and  network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading  among tools and fabs, and the installation of anti-virus and  advanced malware detection solutions across our computer  devices. In addition, TSMC has deployed secure PCs and  laptops, developed a public cloud security policy, introduced  new technology for data protection, and improved email  phishing detection. TSMC also established an integrated and  automatic security operation platform, and it regularly perform  employee awareness testing and conduct external security  risk assessments. While these ongoing enhancements further  improve Company’s cybersecurity defense solutions, there can  be no assurance that the Company is immune to cyberattacks. In addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers  for the Company and its affiliates worldwide with whom it  needs to share highly sensitive and confidential information to  enable them to provide the relevant services. Despite that the  Company requires the third-party service providers to comply  with the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements  in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that  each of them will strictly fulfill such obligations, or at all. The  on-site network systems of and the off-site cloud computing  networks such as servers maintained by such service providers  and/or its contractors are also subject to risks associated with  cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to  timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by  such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of  its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third  parties) or control of its or its service providers’ computing  systems, the Company’s commitments to its customers and  other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of  operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may  also be materially and adversely affected as a result. Risks Associated with Intellectual Property Rights The Company’s ability to compete successfully and to achieve  future growth depends in part on the continued strength of  its intellectual property portfolio. While we actively enforce  and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be  no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent  the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary  technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the  Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business  models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop  independently the technologies, patents, software, trade  secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that  it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual  property rights of others. As a result, TSMC may have to rely  on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent  licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies  on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will  be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the  future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of  necessary licenses could expose TSMC to claims for damages  and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for  indemnification by its customers in instances where it has  contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against  damages resulting from infringement claims. TSMC has received, from time to time, communications  from third parties, including non-practicing entities  and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC’s  technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs  of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those  semiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents  or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature  of the industry, its market position, and the expansion  of its manufacturing operations in foreign jurisdictions,  the Company may receive an increased number of such  communications in the future. The assertions made and  lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing  entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand  and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and  assertions may increase TSMC’s cost of doing business and may  potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities  succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services  offered by TSMC. Also, with the Company’s expansion of its  manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C. jurisdictions,  it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of  intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts  to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual  property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot  guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others,  or at all. If TSMC fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or  intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual  property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating  to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (1)  prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products  or selling particular services or applying particular technologies;  and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities  benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property,  which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue. TSMC has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of  shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and  litigation filed against the Company. These measures include:  strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor  and other technology companies as needed; timely securing  intellectual property rights originating within and outside  of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC  technology and business; and aggressively defending against  baseless litigation. Risks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious Matters As is the case with many companies in the semiconductor  industry, we have received from time to time communications  from third parties asserting that its technologies, its  manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors  made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its  customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual  property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in  litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments  by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims,  TSMC could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or  could suffer adverse effects on its operations. TSMC is also  subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by  governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse  results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that  may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC’s business  and distract its management, and thereby have a material  adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and  subject TSMC to potential significant legal liability. On September 28, 2017, TSMC was contacted by the  European Commission (the “Commission”), which asked  us for information and documents concerning alleged  anti-competitive practices in relation to semiconductor sales. We cooperated continuously with the Commission to provide  the requested information and documents. The Commission  subsequently decided to close the investigation in May 2020. Other than the matters described above, as of the date of  this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any other  material legal proceedings. Risks Associated with Mergers and Acquisitions In 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC did not  conduct any merger or acquisition. Risks Associated with Recruiting Quality Personnel TSMC relies on the continued services and contributions of its  management team skilled technical and professional personnel.  The Company’s business could suffer from the inability to fulfill  personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely  fashion caused by the loss of personnel, illegal talent poaching,  or related changes in market demand for its products and  services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment,  the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel  demand. In order to reduce the risk of talent recruitment, TSMC  encourages job rotation and implements on-the-job training  and certification system. In this way, employees can learn  and enhance their work efficiency in the actual work field.  Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment channels and  continues to hire top-notch talents from Taiwan and overseas.  TSMC recruits diversified and various special professional  talents, and at the same time strengthen industry-academic  cooperation. Grasp outstanding talents earlier can help TSMC  recruit them in the future. Future R&D Plans and Expected R&D Spending For additional details, see “5.2.7 Future R&D Plans” on page  86-87 of this annual report. Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on  Company’s Crisis Management TSMC has established an excellent corporate reputation around  the world based on its core values of integrity, commitment,  innovation and customer trust. The Company’s positive image  also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate  governance and dedication to social responsibility by serving as  a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation  in the economic, environmental and social dimensions of CSR. In 2020, TSMC was honored with numerous awards for  achievements in operations, corporate governance, patents,  profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection,  corporate sustainability and other fields. These included: the  Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy 2020 Taiwan Corporate  Sustainability Awards’ Most Prestigious Sustainability Award,  Platinum Medal For Sustainability Report, Sustainable Water  Management Award, Climate Leader Award, and Supply  Chain Management Award; First Place in CommonWealth  Magazine’s Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility  Award for Large-Cap companies; ranked top 5% in the Taiwan  Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation; member of  Fortune Magazine’s 2020 World’s Most Admired Companies  and the 2020 Global 500; the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic  Affairs Industrial Development Bureau’s Green Factory Label  and Energy Conservation Benchmark Award; the R.O.C.  Environmental Protection Administration’s Enterprise Green  Procurement Award; Membership in the Corporate Knights  100 Most Sustainable Corporations for 2020; ranked No.1 in  the 2020 Carbon Clean 200 list by Corporate Knights and As  You Sow; Membership in the Wall Street Journal’s 100 Most  Sustainably Managed Companies; and named Most Impactful  Pioneer in the 2020 RE100 Leadership Awards. In addition,  TSMC was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability  Indices for the 20th consecutive year. TSMC adheres to its vision of uplifting society, and applies  technology and innovation to help humanity overcome  many challenges. As TSMC strives to excel in corporate social  responsibility, the Company also encourages employees to  make innovative breakthroughs in how they think about things  and do things, as well as nurture their empathy and broaden  their horizons. In 2020, the Corporate Social Responsibility  Executive Committee, led by Chairman Dr. Mark Liu, held the  first “TSMC CSR AWARD,” taking tangible action to encourage  all employees to propose ideas for sustainability in the five  strategic directions of corporate social responsibility, including  green manufacturing, building a responsible supply chain,  creating an inclusive workplace, talent development, and  caring for the underprivileged. The award further motivates  TSMC colleagues to think innovatively about their work,  implement corporate social responsibility, and build further on  the Company’s positive corporate reputation. events, and utility supply disruption. TSMC sets crisis response  and recovery measures according to possible crisis events and  maintains a “TSMC crisis command center control instruction”  as well as a “TSMC emergency response procedure” to  establish its emergency response command structure. TSMC  also holds regular exercises for crisis scenarios to ensure that  crisis response procedures are comprehensive. TSMC holds regular monthly meetings of the Environment,  Safety and Health Committee, which coordinates relevant  departments in each fab to conduct regular emergency  response drills and continuously improve their notification  and operational procedures to ensure clear channels of  communication to stakeholders in crisis management, with the  public relations department serving as the designated gateway  for external communications. In the event of an emergency, all departments immediately  deploy emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize  impact on personnel safety, the surrounding environment,  company property and manufacturing operations. Responders  also alert the public relations department at the earliest  stages of response to ensure timely, clear and consistent  communication regarding the situation. Risks Associated with Change in Management During 2020 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there  were no such risks for TSMC. 6.3.4 Financial Risks Economic Risks ● Interest Rate Fluctuation TSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily related to its  investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest  rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and  cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of  those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt. The objective of TSMC’s investment policy is to achieve a  return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and  support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires  the Company to invest in securities with investment grade and  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. TSMC’s  cash and cash equivalents as well as fixed income investments  in both fixed- and floating-rate securities carry a degree  of interest rate risk. The majority of TSMC’s fixed income  investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as  financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive ● Foreign Exchange Volatility Substantially all of TSMC’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars  and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in  currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros,  and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to  its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against  such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar  against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the  Company’s revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT  dollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S.  dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately  0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company’s operating  margin based on its 2020 results. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus  other major currencies, the demand for the products and  services of TSMC’s customers and for TSMC’s goods and  services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the  Company’s revenue. income, and may have their fair value adversely affected due  to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall,  cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may  generate less interest income than expected. TSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest  rate futures to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed  income investments. However, these hedges can offset only  a small portion of the financial impact from movements in  interest rates. All of the Company’s short-term debt is floating-rate, hence a  rise in interest rates may result in higher interest expense than  expected. The majority of its long-term debt is fixed-rate and  measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest  rates would not affect the future cash flows and the carrying  amount. Certain of TSMC’s fixed income investments and short-term  debt are primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate  (LIBOR), which is expected to be replaced by other benchmark  rates after 2021. TSMC cannot predict the consequences and  timing of these developments, or whether such a transition  might cause a reduction in its interest income and/or an  increase in its interest expense. denominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted  transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely  eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate  movements on its assets and liabilities. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and  the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s  common shares and the market price of the Company’s  American Depositary Shares (ADSs) and of any cash dividends  paid in NT dollar on TSMC’s common shares represented by  ADSs. ● Inflation In 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, inflation had  no material impact on TSMC’s operations, or the business  operations of its customers and suppliers. Any amendments to existing tax regulations or the  implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in  which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect  on its net income. While the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations  in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts  business, TSMC’s principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it  is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government.  Any unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in this  jurisdiction could increase TSMC’s effective tax rate and have  an adverse effect on its operating results. In order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors  all domestic and foreign governmental policies and  regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC  has established risk management procedures to collect  information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop  countermeasures. Risks Associated with External Financing In times of market instability, sufficient external financing  may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, on  commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If  sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs  such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company  may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay  the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains  such financing. Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged  Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees  for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative Transactions In 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC made  no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments. In 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC  has provided guarantees to TSMC Global, a wholly-owned  subsidiary of TSMC, for its issuances of US dollar-denominated  senior unsecured bonds in amounts not to exceed US$7.5  billion in total. Among which, US$3 billion senior unsecured  bonds were already issued in September 2020. Since 2014,  TSMC has provided a guarantee of no more than US$83.21  million to TSMC North America, a wholly owned subsidiary  of TSMC, for its obligation to an office leasing contract. Since  2020, TSMC Japan Limited has provided a guarantee of no  more than JPY1,320 million to TSMC Design Technology Japan,  Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSMC, for its obligation to  an office leasing contract. As of February 28, 2021, there were RMB 4.8 billion  outstanding intercompany loans between TSMC’s subsidiaries,  and US$3.1 billion outstanding intercompany loans between  TSMC and its subsidiary. All intercompany loans were in  compliance with relevant rules and regulations. All derivative financial transactions entered in 2020 by TSMC  were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative  purposes. For more transaction information and risk  assessment, please refer to Note 7, Note 10, and Note 32 of  the annual report section (II), Financial Statements. To manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has  established internal control policies and procedures based  on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance  with the relevant rules and regulations issued by the Taiwan  Securities and Futures Bureau. TSMC’s policies and procedures  include “Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions,”  “Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties,” “Procedures  for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets,” and “Procedures for  Endorsement and Guarantee”. Risks Associated with Impairment Charges Under Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible  assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment  whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are  met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. is not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment  charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may  have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net income. The determination of an impairment charge at any given  time is mainly based on the projected results of operations  over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an  impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period  when the Company’s operating results are otherwise already  depressed. See “Note 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS  AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY” in  Annual Report section (II), Financial Statements for a discussion  of how TSMC assesses if an impairment charge is required and,  if so, how the amount is determined. 6.3.5  Hazardous Risks and Utility Supply Interruption or The frequency and severity of disruptive events, including  damaging earthquakes, other natural disasters and severe  weather, have been increasing in part due to climate change or  systemic regional geological changes. TSMC has manufacturing  and other operations in locations subject to natural disasters  such as flooding, earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons and  droughts that may cause interruptions or shortages in the  supply of utilities, such as water and electricity, which in turn  could disrupt operations. For example, in 2021, Taiwan has  faced one of the worst droughts in decades. Government  restrictions on supply and usage of water by industrial  companies such as TSMC in response to such severe weather  events could also disrupt our operations. In addition, TSMC’s  suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations.  For example, most of TSMC’s production facilities, as well as  those of many of its suppliers and customers and upstream  providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing  services, are located in Taiwan and Japan, areas susceptible to  earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, and droughts from  time to time that may cause shortages in electricity or water, or  interruptions to the Company’s operations. Thus, if one or more natural disasters that result in a prolonged  disruption to TSMC’s operations or those of its customers or  suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be  damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion or  fire, it could reduce the Company’s manufacturing capacity  and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have  an adverse and material impact on its operational and financial  performance. TSMC has occasionally suffered power outages or surges in  Taiwan caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity  supplier, the Taiwan Power Company, or other power  consumers on the same power grid. Some of these have  resulted in interruptions to TSMC operations. Such shortages or  interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated  by changes in the energy policy of the government, which  intends to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country by 2025. If the  Company is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply  of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs within Taiwan, its  ability to fill customers’ orders would be severely jeopardized. If such events were to occur over prolonged periods of  time, TSMC’s operations and financial performance may be  materially adversely affected. Future expansions of TSMC’s operations in the R.O.C. could be  limited by shortages in water and electricity, and the limited  availability of commercial-use land. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may materially adversely  affect TSMC business and results of operations in several  ways, including but not limited to: (1) interruption of the  operations of TSMC’s supply chains for equipment, parts and  materials in terms of manufacturing, logistics, and manpower  arrangements for tool installation; (2) significant fluctuation  in TSMC customers’ demands for certain products, leading  to uncertainties for TSMC’s capacity planning and also for  meeting customers’ demand, which may harm TSMC’s  business with customers and subject TSMC to risks of legal  disputes; and (3) potential production delays for TSMC’s  products due to forced factory or office closures or partial  operation. The Company has implemented various measures to address  the abovementioned risks, including but not limited to,  health management of TSMC’s employees, management  of production inventory, supply chain risk management,  and capacity management for demand changes. TSMC has  formed an “Epidemic Prevention Committee” to identify,  implement and monitor such actions as required by the  dynamic exigencies arising from the pandemic. As of the date  of this annual report, TSMC’s current business and results of  operations have not been materially affected by the pandemic,  partially due to such trends as work-from-home and distance  learning emerged to help accelerate the digital transformation.  However, there is no certainty that the measures the Company  has taken will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by  COVID-19, and TSMC’s ability to perform critical functions and to meet customers’ needs could be materially adversely  affected. TSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system  dedicated to the safety of people, the conservation of  natural resources and the protection of property. In order  to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters,  management at each facility has developed comprehensive  plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency  response, crisis management and business continuity. All  TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified  (environmental management system) and ISO 45001 certified  (occupational health and safety management system). All  manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan  Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified.  New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18  months after acquiring factory registration certification. TSMC has further strengthened its business continuity plans,  which include periodic risk assessment, risk mitigation, and  implementation through the establishment of emergency  taskforces when necessary, combined with the preparation of  a thorough analysis of an emergency, its impact, alternative  actions, and solutions for each possible scenario together with  appropriate precautionary and/or recovery measures. Each  taskforce is given the responsibility of ensuring TSMC’s ability  to minimize personal injury, business disruption and financial  impact under the circumstances. TSMC periodically reviews its  business continuity plans and revise it according to exercise  results and implementation. In response to the impact of the earthquake that occurred in  Taiwan, TSMC continued to improve its earthquake emergency  response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and  readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These  improvements have also been integrated into new fab design.  TSMC business continuity procedures were further enhanced  through the compliance with ISO 22301. TSMC and many of its suppliers use combustible and toxic  materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore  subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising  from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although  the Company maintains many overlapping risk prevention  and protection systems, as well as fire and casualty insurance,  TSMC’s risk management and insurance coverage may not  always be sufficient to cover all of the Company’s potential  losses. If any of TSMC’s fabs or vendor facilities were to be  damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the Company’s  manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important  sales and customers and as a negative impact on TSMC’s  financial performance. In addition to periodic fire-protection  inspections and firefighting drills, the Company has also carried  out a corporate-wide fire risk mitigation project focused on  managerial and hardware improvements. 6.3.6  Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export ● damages to TSMC’s goodwill and reputation. Because TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple  jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers  located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of  governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing,  assembling and testing of TSMC’s products require the  use of metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject  to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and  humanitarian conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and  guidelines issued worldwide. Complying with applicable laws and regulations, such as  environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could  also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following:  (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement  remedial programs such as climate change mitigation  programs; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing  processes, or incur other significant expenses such as obtaining  substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be  less available for the Company’s operations. TSMC’s inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for  the conduct of its business could impair its operational and  financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to  timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to  undertake the development and construction of a new fab  or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or  increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn  adversely affect its business and operational results. In light  of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC’s  operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or  delayed responding to public concern and social environmental  pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable  laws and regulations. TSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a  significant corporate risk that must be controlled to improve  competitiveness. For TSMC’s climate change related risks  and control measures, see the Climate Change and Energy  Management section under “7.2.1 Environmental Protection“  on page 131-132 of this annual report. 6.3.7 Other Risks Potential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of  Significant Numbers of Shares by TSMC’s Directors,  and/or Major Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of  TSMC’s Total Outstanding Shares The value of TSMC shareholders’ investment may be reduced  by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major  shareholders. As of the date of this annual report, no single shareholder  owned 10% or more of TSMC’s total outstanding shares. Risks of Trade Policies As TSMC’s revenue is primarily derived from sales to major  economies in the world (please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position,  Differentiation and Strategy” on page 15-17 of this annual  report), any changes in the trade policies (such as the increase  of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import  and export controls, and the adoption of other trade barriers)  of such major economies can affect the sales of TSMC or  its customers and thereby affect TSMC’s operating results.  TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies  and measures among the relevant major economies and will  take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with  subsequent developments. In May 2020 and again in August 2020, the U.S. tightened its  export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd.  and its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”), including an expanded  license requirement for providing Huawei with items subject  to the U.S. export control jurisdiction. To comply with relevant  laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of  products to Huawei since September 15, 2020. On the other  hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract  impacts of another country’s actions or regulations could  lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations  including our own. For example, in January 2021, China  adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles  Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational’s  compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies. As of the date of this annual report, our current results of  operations have not been materially affected. Nevertheless,  depending on future developments of global trade tensions,  such relevant regulations, rules, or measures may have an  adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may  incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result. TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies  and measures among the relevant major economies and will  take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with  subsequent developments. Other Material Risks In 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC’s  management was not aware of any other risk that could have  a potentially material impact on the financial status of the  Company. 126 127 7.1 Overview The Company’s four core values of integrity, commitment, innovation, and customer trust remain as the core values of TSMC’s  culture. As the world’s leading semiconductor foundry and a trusted technology and capacity provider, TSMC seeks, in addition  to continued success in its business endeavors, to fulfill its ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) management. For TSMC  these responsibilities fall into three primary missions: acting with integrity, strengthening environmental protection and caring  for the disadvantaged. For each of these missions the Company has established concrete, measurable long-term goals, as well as  corresponding action plans to review and correct periodically, consistently creating value for all stakeholders. Guidance for the Implementation of ESG TSMC’s “ESG Policy” is the overarching guiding principle for sustainable development. The “ESG Matrix” set by the Company’s  founder Dr. Morris Chang, clearly defines the scope of TSMC’s ESG responsibility. The horizontal axis shows the seven areas where  TSMC strives to demonstrate its ESG commitment: morality, business ethics, economy, rule of law, sustainability, work/life balance  and happiness, and philanthropy. On the vertical axis are actions that TSMC has taken to fulfill these responsibilities. ESG Management In compliance with the vision and missions of TSMC’s ESG Policy, the ESG Steering Committee serves as the highest-level ESG  decision-making center within the Company and is committed to aligning TSMC more closely with international sustainability  trends. TSMC’s Chairman chairs the ESG Steering Committee, and the Chairperson of the ESG Committee serves as Executive  Secretary. Together with senior executives from a wide variety of functions, they survey the Company’s core operating capabilities,  set the medium- to long-term strategic direction for ESG, and draft the blueprint to link the Company’s core competencies with the  UN sustainable development goals (SDGs). The Company’s ESG Committee serves as a cross-departmental communication platform. Through quarterly meetings and  issue-based discussions by cross-organizational teams, the committee members jointly set the Company’s ESG strategies, identify  key issues for the year, draft ESG-related budgets for their organizations and coordinate resource deployment, as well as plan and  carry out annual projects. The Committee pursues sustainability objectives of interest to all stakeholders and ensures ESG strategies  are implemented effectively in the Company’s daily operations. The Chairperson of the ESG Committee reports quarterly to the Board of Directors on implementation results and the work planned  in the future. In 2020, TSMC focused on strengthening renewable energy adoption, driving in-house reuse rate of resources to  realize circular economics, applying circular economy, and launching the TSMC Urban Greenery Project. To build a sustainable  supply chain, the Company implemented a signed supplier code of conduct, performed supplier risk assessments and launched  Supply Online 360, a Global responsible supply chain management platform, to extend TSMC’s high operational standards. The  Company also created an inclusive workplace by piloting a “Psychological Safety” program to enable open communication and  develop semiconductor talent and support through STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education. To have  a positive social impact, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation and the TSMC Charity Foundation also actively support and  promote youth development, culture and art, and care for the disadvantaged. Stakeholder Engagement TSMC respects all stakeholder rights. To understand the level of interest in sustainability issues, TSMC uses multiple systematic channels  to communicate with stakeholders, including the “Contact Us” section of the corporate website, the ESG website and the ESG  mailbox, the Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System, as well as the new Supply Chain Worker Grievance Channel, established in  2020. TSMC has conducted three studies focused on identification, prioritization and validation with regard to these issues. In 2020, the TSMC ESG mailbox received 445 valid emails on subjects ranging from corporate governance, innovation and services,  to supply chain management, green manufacturing, inclusive workplace, and social investments. Submissions were primarily  regarding requests for inquiries on operations, proposals for donations and collaborations, opinion and feedback from the public  and visits. TSMC responded through direct action from related departments and timely replies from the public relations department,  supporting communication with the public as well as positive development in society. ● Regular and ad-hoc communication meetings, such as Manager Development Consulting Committee, Operations Engineer Training Committee, Manufacturing  Department Technical Committee, Proprietary Information Protection (PIP) Committee, etc. ● Employee voice channels, such as Immediate Response System, Employee Opinion Box, Wellness Center, wellness website, Employee PIP Opinion Dedicated Line, etc. ● Ombudsman System ● Audit Committee Whistleblower System ● EWC event questionnaire survey ● The biennial “Employee Opinion Survey on Company Core Values” Note: Society includes community, non-governmental organizations, non-profit organizations and the public. TSMC believes that companies exist to bring positive change to the world. The Company knows that the future is filled with  challenges but it will always stay true to its cornerstones of – integrity and responsible operations. TSMC has chosen nine major  United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), drafted 2030 long-term goals, and implemented sustainable approaches  accordingly. With Goal 17 of the SDG – global partnerships – at the core, TSMC collaborates with stakeholders inside and outside  the Company as well as with business partners along the value chain. Through participation, cooperation, and dialogue, TSMC  actively creates sustainable values in the governance/economy, the environment and society for its stakeholders, and has become  the only semiconductor company chosen for the Dow Jones Sustainability World Indices over the past 20 consecutive years. ● Regular visits to National Museum of Science, Hsinchu Veterans Home, St. Teresa Children Center, Jacana Ecology Education Park, remote schools and TSMC  ecological parks to provide volunteer services R.O.C.

The Company’s  ESH policies aim to achieve “zero incident” and “environmental  sustainability” and to make TSMC a world-class organization in  environmental, safety and health management. The Company’s  strategies for attaining these goals are to comply with  regulations, promote safety and health, strengthen recycling  and pollution prevention, manage ESH risks, instill an ESH  culture, establish a green supply chain, and fulfill its related  corporate social responsibilities. All TSMC manufacturing facilities have received ISO 14001:  2015 certification for environmental management systems  and ISO 45001: 2018 certification for occupational safety  and health management systems. All fabs in Taiwan have  been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health  Management System) certified since 2009. The International  Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the latest  version of ISO 45001: 2018 to replace OHSAS 18001 in March  2018. All TSMC fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001: 2018  certification in August 2019. All TSMC subsidiaries obtained  certification in 2020. TSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks  to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention  and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction  and recycling, safety and health management, fire and  explosion prevention as well as to minimize the impact of  earthquake damage, so as to reduce overall environmental,  safety and health risks. In order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the  management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the  IECQ QC 080000 Hazardous Substance Process Management  (HSPM) System. All TSMC manufacturing facilities have been  QC 080000 certified since 2007. Through the establishment  of QC 080000, TSMC ensures that its products comply with  international regulatory and customer requirements, including  the European Union’s “Restriction of Hazardous Substances  (RoHS) Directive,” the EU’s “Registration, Evaluation,  Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),” the  “Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone  Layer,” the “halogen-free in electronic products” initiative,  Perfluorooctane Sulfonates (PFOS), Perfluorooctanoic Acid  (PFOA) and its related substances restriction standards. In addition, TSMC started a project for reducing usage of  hazardous substance N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) in 2016.  NMP unit product usage has been reduced 59% by 2020  comparing to 2016, and the project will continue promoting  for further reduction. Since 2011, TSMC has adopted the ISO 50001 Energy  Management System for the continuous improvement  in energy conservation. In 2019, all TSMC fabs in Taiwan  received ISO 50001 Energy Management System certification,  and all TSMC overseas subsidiaries scheduled to receive the  certification in 2019 have had their certifications postponed to  2021 due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Aiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017  TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee  led by managers at the vice president level. The committee  members include site directors, managers of safety and health  department, and representatives from wellness, HR and legal  affairs divisions. External experts have also been invited to  discuss the potential risks of occupational diseases in the  semiconductor manufacturing process and prevention plans for  such diseases. To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers  and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous  safety and health control measures focused on preventing  occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee  safety, physical and mental health. To mitigate the supply chain risk and fulfill corporate social  responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices  internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its  suppliers and contractors through audits and counseling. TSMC uses priority work management and self-management  to govern services provided by contractors. The Company  requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations  to complete certification for technicians and to establish their  own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The  promotion of self-management aims at improving sense of  responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and  technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For  onsite contractor personnel, TSMC has standardized courses on  safety and health and increased the frequency of such courses  to improve training effectiveness and safety awareness. To  ensure the Company’s safety protocols are accurately delivered  to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital  platform for mutual communication so that onsite operational  risks can be mitigated. ● Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Given that climate change could potentially affect operations and pose financial risk, in 2018 TSMC adopted recommendations  of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to identify risk and  opportunities, and further established metrics and target management based on the identification results. TSMC collaborates with suppliers to improve the sustainability of the Company’s supply chain regarding ESH-related issues, such  as environmental protection, compliance of safety and hygiene codes, hazardous substance management, fire protection, and  mitigation of natural disaster. The Company not only performs ESH audits at its suppliers’ manufacturing sites, but also proactively  assists them to improve ESH performance. In addition, TSMC monitors potential climate-change related risks in the supply chain. The Company requests that suppliers conduct  carbon emissions inventory and encourages them to implement measures to save energy, reduce carbon emissions, conserve water  and reduce waste. In recent years, TSMC suppliers have made excellent progress in procedure establishment and implementation for pollution control  and safety management. To take it a step further, the Company has given greater attention to occupational hygiene issues directly  related to labor health. In 2017, TSMC and the Ministry of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) jointly  launched the “Semiconductor Supply Chain Safety and Health Promotion Project”. TSMC also invited suppliers to participate in the  project. As engaged by OSHA, a professional team has taken on the responsibility of providing consultation through document  review and onsite inspection to participating suppliers on management procedures and hardware setup in order to improve the  working environment and labor health management. 7.2.1 Environmental Protection Climate Change and Energy Management ● ESG Steering Committee led by Chairman is the Company’s top organization that deals with climate change management. The chairperson of ESG Committee serves as the  Executive Secretary. ESG Steering Committee reviews TSMC’s climate change strategies and goals every six months and reports to the Board of Directors. (The Corporate  Social Responsibility Executive Committee has been renamed as ESG Steering Committee in 2021. The frequency of regular meetings has been increased from semi-annual to  quarterly.) ● The Energy and Carbon Reduction Committee led by the senior vice presidents of Fab operations is the organization that deals with action implementation of climate change  risk and opportunity in TSMC. This committee develops management plans, reviews the execution status and discusses future plans on a quarterly basis. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Reduction and Energy Management TSMC actively participates in the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) in its efforts to establish a global voluntary PFC (perfluorinated  compounds) emissions reduction goal for the decade of 2011 to 2020, and has incorporated past experience to develop best  practices. The implementation of best practices has been adopted by the WSC as a major element of the 2020 goal. In 2013,  in accordance with the “EPA Early Actions for Carbon Credit of Greenhouse Gases Reduction” regulation, TSMC applied for the  recognition of greenhouse gas reduction from 2005 to 2011, and received 5.28 million tons of carbon dioxide credits in 2015.  Those carbon credits can be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental  Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company’s sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk. Since 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG  emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely  used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the  inventory data is not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for TSMC’s  strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Since 2005, TSMC participated the international organization “Carbon Disclosure Program, CDP”  to publicly disclose climate change related information every year. In 2020, TSMC was recognized by CDP as A- and A leadership  level for climate change and water security respectively. In response to the commitment of global climate summit “Paris Agreement” and the Republic of China’s “Greenhouse Gas  Reduction and Management Act” promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for corporate carbon  management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, carbon emission reduction, and carbon  credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, TSMC also sets  short, medium and long-term reduction targets through the energy and carbon reduction committee led by senior vice presidents  which are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 75% of TSMC’s GHG emissions ● TSMC’s power purchasing agreements for  renewable energy totaled 1.3 GW (Gigawatts) ● Purchased 1,230 GWh in renewable energy,  renewable energy certificates (REC), and carbon  credit to offset 100% of the electricity carbon  emissions of our overseas subsidiaries, global  offices and offices. come from electricity consumption, TSMC always emphasizes  energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC  has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its  manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously  improved the energy efficiency of its facilities during operation.  These efforts simultaneously reduce both carbon dioxide gas  emissions and costs. TSMC has accumulated 1.7 billion kilowatt  hours (kWh) power conservation since 2016. From 2015 to 2017, TSMC voluntarily participated in the  Republic of China Ministry of Economic Affairs’ green power  purchasing program for three consecutive years and became  the largest buyer in Taiwan, purchasing 400 million kilowatt  hours of green power. Although the Taiwan Power Company  stopped selling green power in 2018, TSMC still aggressively  negotiates the purchase of renewable energy with renewable  energy suppliers in Taiwan. Targeting a long-term commitment  of 100% renewable energy for the Company, TSMC is first  committed to achieving a target of 25% renewable energy  for fabs and 100% renewable energy for non-fab facilities  by 2030. Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and  offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon  credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power  consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved zero carbon  emission of electricity consumption in 2020 again. TSMC also  used carbon credits to offset Carbon emissions of natural gas  consumption in kitchens, achieving the milestone of net zero  emission for TSMC global offices. Although development  of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC  established a renewable energy task force and continued to  communicate closely with government through the Association  of Science Park Industries and Taiwan Semiconductor  Industry Association. The Company made recommendations  to the government in the hope that the collaboration could  speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan. The  recommendations included expanding the development of  offshore wind power and increasing supply of renewable  energy trading platform. TSMC also continued to find  renewable energy. By the end of 2020, the total installation  capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 1.3GW  (Gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC  gradually after related business process being completed. This  is a clear manifestation of the Company’s active support of the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). TSMC became the first semiconductor company to join RE100  (Global Renewable Energy Initiative) in July 2020 and pledged  that power consumption of all the Company’s manufacturing  plants and offices will be 100% supplied from renewable  energy by 2050. TSMC was further awarded the first RE100  Leadership Award - the Most Impactful Pioneer in September 2020 for being the first to purchase large amounts of  renewable electricity in Taiwan and taking practical action to  support green energy. Air and Water Pollution Control The Company has installed effective air and water pollution  control equipment in each wafer fab to meet regulatory  emissions standards. In addition, TSMC maintains backup  pollution control systems, including emergency power  supplies, to lower the risk of pollutant emissions in the event  of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the  operations of its air and water pollution control equipment  around the clock and treats system effectiveness as an  important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air  and discharged water. To make the most effective use of Taiwan’s limited water  resources, all TSMC fabs strive to increase water reclamation  rates by adjusting the water usage of manufacturing  equipment and improving wastewater reclamation systems.  All fabs meet or exceed the process water reclamation  rate standard of the Science Park Administration. Some  fabs are able to reclaim more than 90% of process water,  outperforming most semiconductor fabs around the world.  TSMC also makes every effort to reduce non-manufacturing- related water consumption, including water used in air  conditioning systems, sanitary facilities, wall cleaning and  landscaping activities and kitchens. TSMC uses an intranet  website to collect and measure water recycling volumes  company-wide. Since water resources are inherently local, TSMC shares its  water saving experiences with other semiconductor companies  through the Association of Science-Based Industrial Park to  promote water conservation in order to achieve the Science  Park’s goals and ensure a long-term balance of supply and  demand. In addition, TSMC has committed to using partially  reclaimed water in newly constructed fabs in the future in  order to further reuse water resources and support government  policy and promotion for reclaimed water. To continue enhancing water resources management, TSMC  has adopted and followed the AWS Standard, the world’s  only sustainable water management standard. Early in 2019,  Fab 6 and Fab 14 Phase 5/6/7 began serving as demonstration  factories and received AWS certification by the end of the year,  making TSMC the first semiconductor enterprise to receive  AWS platinum level certification in the world. In 2020, Fab 15A  and Fab 15B, located in Central Taiwan Science Park, passed  third party verification audit and obtained AWS platinum level  certification simultaneously. Waste Management and Recycling The Company has a designated unit responsible for waste recycling and disposal. To meet the goal of sustainable resource  utilization, TSMC’s priorities are: process waste reduction, onsite regeneration and reuse, and offsite recycling. The last option  consists of treatment or disposal. To achieve raw material reduction, resource recycling and the goal of zero waste, for example, the  Company built an in-house waste sulfuric acid pre-treatment system, as electronic grade sulfuric acid can be used as a waste water  treatment agent after the wafer fabrication process. In order to track waste flow and ensure that all waste is treated or recycled  legally and properly, TSMC carefully selects waste disposal and recycling contractors. All recycling contractors must report their  recycled product sales monthly. The Company performs regular onsite audits to check factory status and review the reported data  with actual reuse and recycling data to assure that the recycled product is flowing downstream properly. TSMC checks their licenses  and on-site operational statuses, and also takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing effectiveness. For example, all waste  transportation contractors have been asked and agreed to join the GPS Satellite Fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and  abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. In addition, all waste recycling and treatment vendors have installed closed-circuit TV  systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. Meanwhile, TSMC also conducts an ongoing survey of recycled  product tracking, actions taken to ensure lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment. In 2020, TSMC’s fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the sixth consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1%  for the eleventh consecutive year. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical  materials to ensure waste flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. TSMC also set up onsite  resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced from processing activities into products to be used onsite or to  sell to other factories. In 2020, the Company not only achieved zero outsourcing treatment of copper-containing liquid waste  and cobalt-containing liquid waste, and zero purchasing of 50% concentration industrial-grade sulfuric acid but also extended its  ammonium sulfate drying system, which converts biologically toxic ammonia wastewater into industrial grade ammonium sulfate as  valuable recycled products for sale. As a result, TSMC has become a leader in waste resources regeneration. Environmental Accounting The purpose of TSMC’s environmental accounting system is to identify and calculate environmental costs for internal management.  At the same time, the Company can also evaluate the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as  to promote economically-effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue growing, environmental  accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC’s environmental accounting measures various environmental  costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting. The  Company’s economic benefit evaluation calculates cost savings for reduction of energy, water or waste and benefits from waste  recycling in accordance with its environmental protection programs. The environmental benefits disclosed in this report include real income from projects such as waste recycling and savings from major  environmental projects. In 2020, the total benefits of environmental protection programs of TSMC fabs including waste recycling  exceeded NT$2,430 million.

TSMC has also continued to upgrade existing office buildings to comply with the LEED standard  each year. From 2008 to 2020, 34 of TSMC’s fabs and office buildings achieved LEED certifications – 3 platinum and 31 gold.  Meanwhile, TSMC also received 5 Taiwan Intelligent Building diamond-class certifications and 23 Taiwan EEWH (ecology, energy  saving, waste reduction and health) certifications – 20 diamond, 2 gold and 1 silver. TSMC believes that more manufacturing companies should convert their facilities into green factories to improve the environment  and lower construction costs. Therefore, the Company freely shares its practical experience with industry, government and  academia. As of the end of 2020, 15,250 visitors from more than 370 different industrial, government, academic and general  community groups had contacted TSMC to learn about the Company’s green building technology and practical experience. Since  2009, TSMC has been a leading supporter of the Taiwan government’s Green Factory Label standard, which includes the Clean  Production and Factory Green Building evaluation systems. TSMC received Taiwan’s first Green Factory Label and 13 labels in total as  of the end of 2020, and is the most awarded company in Taiwan. Environmental Audit Results in Violation of Environmental Regulations During 2020 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC has no incurred any environmental pollution related losses. However,  the Company was given two fines totaling NT$127,000 for violating environmental regulations: NT$100,000 issued on 01/06/2021  for failing to take effective air pollutant control measures at our construction site (Section 2 of Article 23 of the Air Pollution  Control Act) – the Company took immediate corrective action after the audit by the competent authority; NT$27,000 issued on  01/28/2021for construction site work failing to conform with the Run-off Wastewater Reduction Plan approved by competent  authority (Article 18 of the Water Pollution Control Act; Article 10 of Water Pollution Control Measures and Test Reporting  Management Regulations) – the Company updated the Run-off Wastewater Reduction Plan after the audit by the competent  authority and enhanced related management measures. 7.2.2 Sustainable Products TSMC collaborates with its upstream material and equipment suppliers, design ecosystem partners and downstream assembly  and testing service providers to minimize environmental impact.

These mobile devices offer  remarkable convenience in daily living, and TSMC contributes  significant value to these devices in the following ways: (1)  new TSMC process technologies help chips achieve faster  computing speeds in smaller sizes, leading to smaller form  factors for these electronic devices. In addition, TSMC  SoC technology integrates more functions into one chip,  reducing the total number of chips in electronic devices,  again resulting in a smaller system form factor; (2) new  TSMC process technologies also help chips reduce power and various smart appliances. TSMC’s industry-leading  offerings include FinFET-based 12-nanometer technology -  N12eTM featuring energy efficiency with high performance  that results in more computing power and AI inferencing,  22nm ULP/Ultra-low leakage (ULL), 28nm ULP, 40nm  ULP, and 55nm ULP, which have been widely adopted by  various edge AI system-on-a-chip (SoC), battery-powered  applications. TSMC has also extended its low Vdd offerings  with wide-range operating voltage SPICE (simulation program  with integrated circuit emphasis) models for extreme  low-power applications. that Enhance Mobility and Convenience 2.  Unleash Customers’ Innovations in CIS and MEMS ● To make machines smarter, safer and more user and  environmentally friendly, sensors are a must. Optical, acoustic,  motion, and environment sensors are mostly made with either  CIS or MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) technologies.  TSMC continues to put substantial effort into developing  more advanced CIS and MEMS technologies to enable  customers to create new products for new applications.  For CIS, TSMC and customers have extended applications  from traditional RGB (red, green, blue) sensing to 3D depth  sensing, optical fingerprint, and NIR machine vision, etc. For  MEMS, TSMC and customers have extended applications  from traditional motion sensing to microphone, bio-sensing,  microspeaker, medical ultrasound actuators and more. TSMC  customers’ sensing devices are used in consumer electronics,  mobile communication, automotive electronics, industrial,  and medical devices, and so on. They are increasingly smaller,  faster, more accurate and more energy efficient, greatly  enhancing human convenience, health and safety, and  contributing to sustainability. For instance, TSMC customers’  CIS and MEMS products are used in a number of advanced  medical treatments as well as in preventative health care  applications. Examples include early warning systems to  minimize the injury from falls for the elderly, systems to  detect physiological changes, car safety systems and other  applications that significantly improve human health and  safety. One remarkable example is that TSMC helps our  customer deliver an innovative handheld, single-probe,  whole-body ultrasound system in 2020. This product is a  particularly useful tool during the global COVID-19 pandemic  due to its fast and sharp lung imaging capabilities, portability  and ease of cleaning, as infection control has become  increasingly important. Moreover, advanced sensors can make  equipment smarter by monitoring the working environment  and conditions so that it can operate in a more energy  efficient way. consumption, allowing mobile devices to be used for a longer  period of time; and (3) TSMC helps spread the growth of  more convenient wireless connectivity such as 3G/4G/5G  and WLAN/Bluetooth, meaning people can communicate  more efficiently and “work anytime and anywhere,”  significantly increasing the mobility of modern society. In  2020, smartphone products represented about 48% of TSMC  revenue. 138 139 7.2.3 Safety and Health Safety and Health Management TSMC’s safety and health management is compliant with local  and international standards and adheres to the management  approach of “Plan, Do, Check, Act” to prevent accidents,  promote employee safety and health, and protect Company  assets. All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received TOSHMS  (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management  System) certification since 2009. In 2018, the International  Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018,  replacing OHSAS 18001, with major changes in the expansion  of the scope, support and participation of the leadership,  collection and planning of internal and external issues,  expectation and demand of stakeholders, evaluation of risk  inspection, communication and consultation of non-managers,  application of performance indicator, and evaluation of  corrective and preventive action. Meanwhile, ISO 45001  ensures the spirit of the system can be effectively implemented  at the management level through management review,  internal audit, automatic check, and security patrol to find  safety concerns and opportunities for improvement. All fabs in  Taiwan received ISO 45001 certification for occupational health  and safety in 2019 and all TSMC subsidiaries obtained the  certification in 2020. Besides accident prevention, TSMC has established emergency  response procedures to protect employees and contractors if  a disaster should occur, as well as to prevent and/or reduce  the negative impact on the community and the environment.  TSMC communicates regularly with suppliers to ensure that  potential risk in the operation of production equipment is  minimized and that safety control procedures are followed  rigorously during installation. The Company places stringent  controls on high-risk operations and also evaluates the seismic  tolerance of its facilities and equipment to reduce the risk of  earthquake damage. For epidemics, TSMC has established corporate-level prevention  committees and procedures for emergency response to  outbreaks of infectious diseases. awareness and sense of accountability to ESH, and building an  ESH culture. TSMC safety and health management operations  apply to the following: ● Equipment Safety and Health Management  In addition to meeting regulatory requirements and internal  standards, as well as mitigating ESH-related risks when building  or expanding facilities, TSMC also maintains procedures  governing new equipment and raw materials, requires safety  approvals for bringing new tools online, updates safety rules,  and implements seismic protection and other safety measures. ● General Safety Management, Training and Audit All TSMC manufacturing facilities hold environmental, safety  and health committee meetings on a monthly basis. TSMC  has adopted multiple preventive measures such as controls  on high-risk work, contractor management, chemical safety  management, personal protective equipment requirements,  and safety audit management. In addition, the Company  maintains detailed disaster response procedures and performs  regular drills designed to minimize damage to employees and  property, as well as the impact on society and the environment  in the event of a disaster. TSMC requires that all new tools meet SEMI-S8 requirements  and that appropriate supplementary control measures be taken  to reduce ergonomic risk. Moreover, the Company endeavors  to automate 300mm front-opening unified pod (FOUP)  transportation to prevent accumulative physical damage  caused by repetitive manual handling of 300mm FOUPs. TSMC  300mm fabs have completed automatic transportation control. As a technology leader in the global semiconductor industry,  TSMC operates increasingly diversified process tools and  introduces new chemicals in the R&D stage. Before using new  tools or new chemicals, they are reviewed carefully by the new  tools and new chemical review committee. The purpose is to  ensure that new tools are compliant with the semiconductor  industry’s safety standards (such as SEMI-S2) and that new  chemicals’ environmental, safety and health concerns can be  well controlled, including engineering controls, application of  personal protection equipment, and operational safety training  during storage, transportation, usage and disposal. ● Working Environment Hazardous Factors Management  TSMC conducts workplace hazard assessments to provide a  comfortable, safe workplace to employees. The Company also  educates and requires employees to use personal protective  equipment (PPE) to prevent hazardous exposures. ● Health Promotion Program In order to establish the healthiest possible workplace and  reduce the incidence of occupational disease, TSMC formed  a corporate-level committee to execute health promotion  programs covering three key areas: (1)  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure  assessment system to identify high health risk employees. (2)   Hazardous training and notification: use standardized  training materials for employees and contractors in all  TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention  measures at the workplace before working or providing any  services there. (3)  Strengthen management of chemicals with significant  health risks: inform suppliers that all materials they provide  to TSMC must comply with applicable laws including clear  disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling  of raw materials used in the manufacturing process  to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic,  mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed in  supplier’s safety data sheet (SDS).  ● Emergency Response The planning and execution of an effective emergency response  should identify potential high-risk events via risk assessment  and be prepared for various scenarios. It should focus on  continuous improvement and drills covering all potentially  serious events. TSMC’s emergency response plans include  procedures for rapid-response crisis management and disaster  recovery for all potential incidents. The Company performs semi-annual workplace environment  assessments of physical and chemical hazards, including CO2  concentration, illumination, noise, and hazardous chemical  substances regulated by local laws. In addition, TSMC has  performed exposure assessments and has used hierarchy  management control for chemicals with potential health  hazards. If abnormal measurements occur, events happen, or  an exposure assessment indicates there is an adverse health  effect for employees, ESH professionals immediately conduct  onsite observation and intervention to reduce the exposure to  acceptable levels. All TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response  exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC’s onsite service  contractors are also required to participate in emergency  response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in  handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage  caused by disasters. At least every two years, each fab director  invites fab management and support functions to participate  in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such  as earthquake, fire and flood (Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC  has conducted complex accident emergency response drills,  which include simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and  chemical spills. In 2019, the Company completed 108 scenarios  to ensure rapid response to emergencies so that losses can be  minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took  lead in the industry to introduce the “All-Hazard” approach  recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop  exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to  minimize the risks of group infections that may arise as a  result of full-scale exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises  also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to  make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively  mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business  continuity in the future. As of October 2020, 75 sessions of  tabletop exercises had been completed in addition to 195  full-scale exercises. In addition to the regular emergency response drills held  by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the  Company’s laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus  personnel also hold emergency response drills to prepare for  events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia release,  fires and traffic accidents. ● Emerging Infectious Disease Response TSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor  emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess  any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an  appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks  such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS  in 2015, as well as with the current COVID-19 threat, TSMC  followed the Taiwan CDC’s (Centers for Disease Control) rules  and convened the corporate influenza response committee  to develop the Company’s strategies. These strategies  included educating employees in prevention and response,  publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for employee sick leave due to flu, and installing alcohol-based  hand sanitizers at appropriate locations. The Committee also  monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the  same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower  shortages and minimize business impact. ● Employee Physical and Mental Health Enhancement TSMC believes that employees’ physical and mental health  is not only fundamental to maintaining normal business  operations but is also part of a corporation’s responsibility. To  protect and promote employee physical and mental health,  TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety  and environmental protection department, onsite medical  personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational  medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral and cardiovascular  disease that might be induced or aggravated by overwork,  night work or shift work. The Company conducts maternal  health protection programs and prevention of cumulative  trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources  to mental health awareness and related activities, which  not only protect employees from hazards at work but also  proactively promote employee health in general. In 2020,  through planned personal health management, (1) 599 female  employees participated in the maternal health program, the  completion rate was 100%. 598 of them were at the first  degree risk (there was no harm to the mother, infant, and  baby). One employee was classified as second degree risk  (possible harm to the mother, infant, and baby) at the first  assessment; after proper adjustments to her works, she was  reclassified as the first degree after doctor’s re-assessment. (2)  By analyzing historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of our  employees, TSMC modified disease assessment criteria with  contracted doctors, and, combining internal annual health  examination reports, as well as working hour’s information,  was able to identify 2,678 employees that have middle to high  risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees  were provided with health education and medical assistance.  Also, along with their managers, they received suggested  working hour recommendations to reduce disease risk. (3) 174  employees were identified in a high risk group for cumulative  trauma disorders. Among them, one could have job-related  risks. The Company has adjusted whose job conditions to avoid  possible risks. (4) As obesity has been considered as a precursor  of diabetes, TSMC has held health promotion programs for  several consecutive years. In 2020, considering the prevention  of COVID-19 and the tendency of young generation’s  preference on social and video media, TSMC conducted a series of on-line interactive activities, such as (1) 2 sessions of  “Health Lecture On-line”, 809 attendees in total. (2) 3 health  education videos about hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and  diabetes, with a total of 7,266 visits. (3) 3 sessions of on-line  quiz, with respect to 3 topics of hypertension, hyperlipidemia,  and diabetes, with a total of 4,618 attendees. (4) 1 session of  “Selection of Health Diet” of DASH diet, 1,019 participants.  The feedbacks were positive to make health promotion can be  continued under epidemic prevention. 7.2.4 Supplier Management Management Aspect For better supply chain management, TSMC is committed to  communicating with and encouraging its suppliers, including  contractors, to increase their quality, cost effectiveness and  delivery performance, and make continuous improvement  in environmental protection, safety and health. Through  regular communication with senior managers, site audits  and experience sharing, the Company collaborates with  major suppliers and contractors to enhance partnerships and  ensure continued improvement of performance and increased  joint contributions to society. As noted above, contractors  performing high-risk activities must lay out clearly-defined  safety precautions and preventative measures. In addition,  contractors working on high-risk engineering projects must  establish ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 systems and the workers  must successfully complete work-related skill training. All  contractors performing high-risk activities must obtain ISO  45001 certification before the end of 2021. Supply Chain Sustainability TSMC works with suppliers in several fields of sustainable  development, such as greening the supply chain, carbon  management for climate change, mitigation of fire risk, ESH  management and business continuity plans in the event of a  natural disaster. Since becoming a full member of the Responsible Business  Alliance (RBA) in 2015, TSMC has completed implementation  of the RBA code of conduct throughout the Company by  performing self-assessments at its facilities worldwide and  reviewing policies and procedures in the areas of labor, health  and safety, environment, ethics and management systems. environmental, safety, health and fire protection regulations.  TSMC developed a supplier’s code of conduct, which  affirmed basic labor rights and standards for health, safety,  environment, ethics and management systems. TSMC works  with suppliers to evaluate the risk and impact on the economy,  the environment, and society and to make continuous  improvement. The Company has helped boost suppliers’  performance of sustainability through experience sharing and  training and hopes to establish a world-class semiconductor  supply chain that exceeds international standards and serves as  a global benchmark. TSMC is subject to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission  (SEC) disclosure rule on conflict minerals released under Rule  13p-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a  recognized global leader in the high-tech supply chain, the  Company acknowledges its corporate social responsibility  to strive to procure conflict-free minerals in an effort to  recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that  protect the dignity of all people. To this end, TSMC has  implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance  with leading industry practices such as adopting the due  diligence framework in the OECD’s Model Supply Chain  Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals from  Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas issued in 2011. TSMC is a strong supporter of the Responsible Business Alliance  and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), which will  help the Company’s suppliers source conflict-free minerals  through their jointly developed Responsible Minerals Initiative  (RMI). Since 2011, TSMC has asked its suppliers to disclose  information and make timely updates on smelters and mines.  The Company encourages suppliers to source minerals from  facilities or smelters that have received a “conflict free”  designation by a recognized industry group (such as the  RBA) and also requires those who have not received such  designation to become compliant with Responsible Minerals  Initiative or an equivalent third party audit program. TSMC  requires the use of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in its  products that are conflict-free. TSMC will continue to conduct the supplier survey annually  and require suppliers to improve and expand their disclosure  to fulfill regulatory and customer requirements. For further  information, see the Company’s Form SD filed with the U.S.  SEC. (https://www.tsmc.com/english/investorRelations/sec_ filings.htm) Working in Tandem with Educational Partners, Closing  the Resource Gap between City and Country Apart from donating one hundred thermographic cameras  to the Ministry of Education as part of the COVID-prevention  measures on campus in Taiwan, the TSMC Education and  Culture Foundation works with its educational partners  to reduce inequality in educational resources. Together  the Foundation and its partner Junyi Academy worked to  develop a series of online courses of adaptive learning titled  “Critical Thinking Training,” which was a response to the  implementation of General Guidelines of Curriculum Guidelines  of 12-Year Basic Education. In addition, the program hosted  26 teaching workshops where teachers learned how to guide  students to think logically and improve their communication  skills. 518 teachers have attended the workshops and more  than 120,000 people have watched them online. As well as providing online educational resources to teachers  and students, the Foundation has long been committed to  narrowing the gap of educational resources between schools  in urban and rural areas. In 2020, it partnered with Cheng Zhi  Education Foundation to assist Emei Junior High School of  Hsinchu county to transition to be a KIST-inspired school. With  the injection of new educational blood, the two foundations  have helped change the lives of many students from schools  in rural areas. The Foundation also continuously teams up  with CommonWealth Education Foundation, Teach for  Taiwan, and the Boyo Social Welfare Foundation. Together the 7.3 TSMC Education and Culture Foundation In 2020, the world was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Starting in March, many venues in Taiwan were shut down  and the impact of the pandemic could be felt in every  sector. In times like these, it behoves the TSMC Education  and Culture Foundation to be the first to donate a hundred  thermographic cameras to the Ministry of Education to  be deployed at national examination locations to support  education and safeguard the health of students with the  power of technology. Although various programs planned by  the Foundation were curtailed by COVID-prevention measures,  in 2020 the Foundation invested over NT$99 million to support  various educational events, art exhibitions and performances.  Through continuous donations, the Foundation hopes to help  reduce educational inequality and bring new ideas to the table  for cultural enrichment. Foundation donates quality books and brings good teachers to  schools in rural areas to narrow the educational gap between  urban and rural areas. Furthermore, in 2020 the Foundation  offered grants to 70 students from low-income families at five  universities: National Tsing Hua University, National Central  University, National Cheng Kung University, National Sun  Yat-sen University, and National Chung Cheng University. In  doing so, the Foundation hopes to assist the students with  financial aid and encourage them to concentrate on their  studies. Nurturing Young Talent, Offering a Stage for Diverse  Development To promote popular science education and nurture talents  for the semiconductor industry, in 1997 TSMC subsidized the  “World of Semiconductors” exhibition hall at the National  Museum of Natural Science, being at the vanguard of  business-supported education of popular science. For the  exhibition to keep up with the times, the TSMC Education  and Culture Foundation updated the content of the exhibition  in 2002 and again in 2011. In 2018, the Foundation  initiated a third renewal project and a brand new “World of  Semiconductors” was officially launched in August 2020.  With the latest upgrade the exhibition hall provides more  in-depth knowledge on semiconductors, adds interactive  exhibitions, and increases the exhibition space. Through  a multi-dimensional experience at the exhibition, visiting  students and the public can broaden their knowledge of  semiconductors and the industry. In the meanwhile, in order  to inspire more female students to take interest in science,  in 2020 the Foundation organized for the first time a “Trip  of TSMC Women Scientists,” inviting students from five girls’  high schools to visit the exhibition and be given guided tours  by women engineers at TSMC. These women engineers have  shared with the young students the trajectory of their learning  and precious work experience, thereby hoping to encourage  girls at high schools not to confine themselves to any subjects  and commit themselves to fields in sciences through in-person  exchange. To motivate college students to pursue their dreams and  encourage young people to commit to environmental  sustainability, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation  organized the fifth “TSMC Youth Dream Building Project” in  2020. It focuses on the theme of “circular economy” as way  to advocate the importance of environmental sustainability Advocating Online Arts and Literary Events, Calming the  Restless Mind During the second half of 2020, the pandemic situation in  Taiwan was relatively under control. Thus, the TSMC Education  and Culture Foundation was able to sponsor a live concert  in Tainan performed by the renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma and  streamed it live globally. With pandemic preventive measures in  place, the Foundation invited the public to the concert hall to  experience the soul-soothing power of virtuoso performance.  At the same time, live streaming allowed audiences all over  the world to enjoy the musical feast. The Foundation also  teamed up with the National Symphony Orchestra (of Taiwan)  to initiate an “Education Program for Youth” project, inviting  Taiwanese-Australian violinist Ray Chen to give master classes  at the National Concert Hall. The classes were streamed live  and broadcasted by Taiwan Public Television Service, thereby  promoting music education to a wider audience. Over 73,000  people have viewed the master classes. to the public and to the younger generation. This project was  open not only to the college students in Taoyuan, Hsinchu,  Maoli and Tainan areas but also to those from Taichung area.  In total, 102 teams of college students participated in the  project. The topics of the proposals covered virtually every issue  in society, ranging from creating a popular science column  on semiconductors, to a wood reclaiming project, and from  an anti-drug campaign to food and agriculture education.  These innovative ideas greatly impressed the panel of judges.  Moreover, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation  continued its support for literary, calligraphic and seal-carving  by young students through funding two annual competitions,  i.e. the “TSMC Youth Literature Award” and the “TSMC Youth  Calligraphy and Seal-Carving Competition,” which are well into  their 17th and 13th years respectively. Both competitions have  become the important events in their respective fields. The  Foundation has also attracted public attention and interest in  literature and calligraphy via the internet. The “TSMC Youth  Literature Award” social platform so far has garnered over  14,000 members and one award-winning piece has been  shared over 3,000 times. The TSMC Education and Culture Foundation wishes to offer  a non-academic platform to young students, where through  science and humanities competitions and events the students  can be inspired to develop diverse interests and explore  wherever their passion takes them. The Foundation has long dedicated itself to promoting Chinese  classic literature. In 2020, it collaborated with National Tsing  Hua University on a general education course, “Pai Hsien-yung  Literature Lectures: Dream of the Red Chamber”. The course  hosted by Mr. Pai Hsien-yung and renowned Honglou meng  specialists from abroad and in Taiwan to give lectures on  various aspects of the classic. The course also invited students  to explore the profoundness of Chinese literature, bringing  a humanistic perspective to their education. Likewise, the  Foundation-funded broadcasting program, “Lectures on the  Classics on Air,” entered its 13th year. The program host,  Professor Xin Yi Yun, has released an audio book, Putting A  Xin’s Spin on Lao Tzu, as an approachable way for the public  to experience the wisdom of Chinese philosophers from the  classics. In the same vein, the 2020 “TSMC Lecture” again  invited the distinguished research fellow Wang Ming-ke of  the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica  to examine how humans have coped with fear and what  measures have been taken historically to deal with pandemics.  The TSMC Education and Culture Foundation has not only  promoted literary talks within local communities but also  posted the talks on an online channel available to the public.  In doing so, the Foundation hopes to go beyond geographic  borders with technology and let arts and literature comfort the  restless minds during these difficult times. 7.4 TSMC Charity Foundation Since its establishment in 2017, the TSMC Charity Foundation  has focused on developing programs and projects relating  to its four main pillar initiatives: disadvantaged care, solitary  elderly care, filial piety promotion, and environmental  protection. Under the leadership of Chairperson Sophie Chang,  the Foundation takes a stand for disadvantaged persons,  focusing on current and potential social issues, and striving to  close the wealth gap in Taiwan society by enhancing education  and providing emergency assistance in rural areas. This support  gives disadvantaged families and children from rural areas  more opportunities to improve their lives. The Foundation has  also established a social welfare platform that magnifies voices  from all corners of society to support social change, powers  social change through charitable works, and uplift Taiwan  society. ● Disadvantaged Care: The Foundation focused on the two  main initiatives for disadvantaged care –“rural education” and  “support for the disadvantaged”. The Foundation provided  volunteer services, building repairs, online educational  materials, off-grade foods, and other assistance to  educational institutions and children in rural areas, ensuring  that disadvantaged groups received equal opportunities  to obtain education. In 2020, the Foundation prioritized  vocational education, collaborating with various enterprises  to promote training and reach the goal of “providing  livelihood/practical skills,” helping students from rural areas  with vocational training. To help support the basic living  needs of the underprivileged, the Foundation continued to  visit and provide financial aid and daily supplies to high-risk  disadvantaged families, providing valuable support to the  already existing social welfare system. ● Solitary Elderly Care: The Foundation improved the health  and welfare of solitary elders by collaborating with its  Networking of Love partners to connect social welfare groups  and medical institutions providing care to solitary elders.  In 2020, the Foundation helped launch a new intelligent  medical system at the Taitung County Sazasa Aborigine  Health Promotion Site to enhance medical quality and  efficacy. The Foundation continued to collaborate with TSMC  Facility Division to provide house repair services at seven  locations in Eastern Taiwan, ensuring a safe and healthy living  space for solitary elders. Current Networking of Love partners  include Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Miaoli General  Hospital, Old Five Old Foundation, Feng Yuan Hospital, In 2020, the Foundation gave support to 62 after-school  care locations benefiting a total of 4,685 students. With  the dedication and knowledge of its TSMC volunteers,  the Foundation created science tutorial videos to promote  science experiments and education. The Foundation also  collaborated with National Chiao Tung University to help  30 elementary schools in Hsinchu City that were lacking  information resources to align with 2019 Curriculum  Guidelines, an issue affecting 18,000 students in the city.  The Foundation’s “Sending Love” programs continued to be  active, and Foundation staff conducted onsite visits to identify  disadvantaged families in need of financial support. The living  conditions of these disadvantaged families were improved  through charitable donations from both inside and outside  TSMC. As of 2020, the Foundation has assisted a total of 155  families. ● Filial Piety Promotion: The Foundation promotes the culture  value of filial piety as part of its efforts to reduce social  risks and problems arising from ageing societies by raising  generational awareness of filial piety. In 2020, volunteers  from TSMC Fabs and Divisions helped promote filial piety  awareness by teaching elementary and junior high school  students to make lunchboxes and write autobiographies,  thereby building a bridge for communication between  generations. The Foundation continues to work with the  K-12 Education Administration Ministry of Education, hosting  four parent-child filial piety workshops in New Taipei City,  Taichung, Yunlin, and Tainan to encourage cross-generational  dialogue and plant the spirit of filial piety in the hearts of the  attendees. ● Environmental Protection: We aim to reduce food waste  through the Cherish Food Program. Through our volunteer  programs, we promote environmental awareness, help  schools improve energy savings inside their facilities, and  also educate and provide information to these schools about  environmental protection. In 2020, the Foundation continued its “Cherish Food Program”  and worked with many food companies to donate off-grade  foods and 11 freezers to 92 institutes that collaborated with  the Foundation to provide care for the disadvantaged, reduce  food waste, and promote environmental conservation. The  Foundation previously collaborated with food companies  including Chi Mei Frozen Food, Hunya Foods, Laurel  Corporation, Lian Hwa Foods Corporation, Hsin Tung Yang  Corporation, and Dachan Great Wall Group.

Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the parent and  to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.    When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting  policies into line with those used by the Company. The IFRSs issued by IASB but not yet endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.    Changes in the Company’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing  control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the  Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative  interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are  adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and  attributed to shareholders of the parent.    When the Company loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is  calculated as the difference between:    a. the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the  date when control is lost; and    b. the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any  non-controlling interest.    The Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the  subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the Company had directly disposed of the related  assets and liabilities.    The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is  regarded as the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate.    The subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements    The detail information of the subsidiaries at the end of reporting period was as follows: TSMC Europe B.V. (TSMC  Europe)      TSMC Japan Limited (TSMC  Japan)      TSMC Design Technology  Japan, Inc. (TSMC JDC)      TSMC Korea Limited (TSMC  Korea) TSMC Partners, Ltd. (TSMC TSMC Global, Ltd.

(VisEra Tech) Cayman Islands    98%    98%    a)    Cayman Islands    98%    98%    a)  U.S.A. U.S.A. (Concluded)    Note a:  This is an immaterial subsidiary for which the consolidated financial statements are not audited by the Company’s independent auditors.    Note b: TSMC JDC has been established in January 2020.    Note c:  TSMC Arizona has been established in November 2020.    Note d: Under the investment agreement entered into with the municipal government of Nanjing, China, the Company will make an investment in Nanjing in the amount of approximately US$3  billion to establish a subsidiary operating a 300mm wafer fab with the capacity of 20,000 12-inch wafers per month, and a design service center. The aforementioned 300mm wafer fab has  reached the capacity of 20,000 12-inch wafers per month.    Note e:  ISDF and ISDF II have completed the liquidation procedures in November 2020.    Foreign Currencies    The financial statements of each individual consolidated entity were expressed in the currency which  reflected its primary economic environment (functional currency). The functional currency of TSMC and  presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are both New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). In  preparing the consolidated financial statements, the operating results and financial positions of each  consolidated entity are translated into NT$.    In preparing the financial statements of each individual consolidated entity, transactions in currencies other  than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing  at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign  currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in  profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are  denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was  determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit  or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in  respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the  exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that  are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.    For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’s  foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting  period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange  differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity  (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).    Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities    Current assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or  consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred  for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting  period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities,  respectively. TSMC Partners    TSMC Development, Inc. TSMC Technology, Inc.

Financial Instruments    Financial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual  provisions of the instruments.    Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets  and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of  the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly  attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are  recognized immediately in profit or loss.     Financial Assets    The classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is  determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are  recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were  classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial  assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the  marketplace.    a. Category of financial assets and measurement     Financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in  debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.     1) Financial asset at FVTPL    For certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized  cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising  from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss  incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.     2) Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI    Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal  and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual  cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.    Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses  and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in  profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in  other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments  are disposed.     3) Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI    On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments  that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI. Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains  and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and  accumulated in other equity.    Dividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss  when the Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, unless the Company’s rights  clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.     4) Measured at amortized cost    Cash and cash equivalents, debt instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including  related parties), other receivables and refundable deposits are measured at amortized cost.    Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal  and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding financial assets  in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost.    Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at  amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less  any impairment loss.    b. Impairment of financial assets    At the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial  assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are  measured at FVTOCI.     The loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit  losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at  FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial  recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from  possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the  other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance  is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over  the expected life of a financial instrument.    The Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a  corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except for  investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is  recognized in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial  asset.    c. Derecognition of financial assets    The Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the  financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards  of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.     On derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s  carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss.  On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset’s  carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or  loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However,  on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that  had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without  recycling through profit or loss. Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments    Classification as debt or equity    Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity  in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability  and an equity instrument.    Equity instruments    An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after  deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds  received, net of direct issue costs.    Financial liabilities    Financial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at  FVTPL.    Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either  held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.     Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses  arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.    Financial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently  measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.    Derecognition of financial liabilities    The Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are  discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability  derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.    Derivative Financial Instruments    Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are  entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The  resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is  designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or  loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.    Hedge Accounting    a. Fair value hedge    The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as interest rate futures contracts, to partially  hedge against the fair value change caused by interest rates fluctuation in the Company’s fixed income  investments. Changes in the fair value of hedging instrument that are designated and qualify as fair  value hedges are recognized in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of  the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risk. Cash flow hedge    The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, to partially  hedge its foreign exchange rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions  (capital expenditures). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is  recognized in other comprehensive income. When the forecast transactions actually take place, the  associated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are removed from  equity and included in the initial cost of the hedged items. The gains or losses from hedging instruments  relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.    The Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases  to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated  or exercised.     Inventories    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost  and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value  represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs  necessary to make the sale.    Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method    Investments accounted for using the equity method are investments in associates.    An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary  nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy  decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.    The operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial  statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate  is initially recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to  recognize the Company’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate as well as  the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.    Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable  assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized  as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company’s  share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of  acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.    When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment  as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell)  with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the  investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of  the investment subsequently increases.    When the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing  ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the  Company’s proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference  as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the  Company’s ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by  other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other  comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as  would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. When a consolidated entity transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions  with the associate are recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of  interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.    Property, Plant and Equipment    Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment. Costs include any incremental costs that are directly attributable to the construction or  acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment.    Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative  purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Such assets are classified to the  appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use.  Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other identical categories of property, plant and  equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.    Depreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful  lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives:  land improvements - 20 years; buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases)  - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating  leases) - 5 years; and office equipment - 5 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and  depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in  estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.    An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic  benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal  or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.    Leases    For a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to  account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.    The Company as lessor    Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.    The Company as lessee    Except for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment  and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use  assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.    Right-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement  of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement  date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets. Subsequent measurement is  calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes  in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are  presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets.    Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the  earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease  transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of  right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the  right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed  payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase  option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using  the lessee’s incremental borrowing rates.    Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest  expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease  payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the  assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a  corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the  consolidated balance sheets.    Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the periods  in which they are incurred.    Intangible Assets    Goodwill    Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of  the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.    Other intangible assets    Other separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated  amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method  over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or  the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period;  patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method  are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted  for on a prospective basis.    Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets    Goodwill    Goodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an  indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is  allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected  to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less  than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill  allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based  on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is  recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent  periods.    Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets    At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property,  plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any  indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable  amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible  to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of  the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can  be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis  can be identified.    Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,  the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects  current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the  estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.    If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,  the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment  loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.    When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit  is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not  exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for  the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately  in profit or loss.    Guarantee Deposit    Guarantee deposit mainly consists of cash received under deposit agreements with customers to ensure they  have access to the Company’s specified capacity. Cash received from customers is recorded as guarantee  deposit upon receipt. Guarantee deposits are refunded to customers when terms and conditions set forth in  the deposit agreements have been satisfied.    Revenue Recognition    The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations  are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are  delivered to the customers’ specified locations.    Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue  is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and  other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of  varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other  current liabilities.    In principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end  of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods  with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without  discounting.    Employee Benefits    Short-term employee benefits    Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount  of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.    Retirement benefits    For defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense  when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement  benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations. Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit  retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including  current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee  benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the  return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in  which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in  retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.     Net defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.    Taxation    Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.    Current tax    Income tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is  expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent  to the year the earnings are generated.    Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision.    Deferred tax    Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable  profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax  assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits  will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.     Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in  subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary  difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only  recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to  utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.    The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to  the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of  the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also  reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient  taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.    Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in  which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted  or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and  assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at  the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.    Current and deferred tax for the year    Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are  recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax  are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. Government Grants    Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply  with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.    Government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise  acquire noncurrent assets (mainly including land use right and depreciable assets) are recognized as a  deduction from the carrying amount of the related assets and recognized as a reduced depreciation or  amortization charge in profit or loss over the contract period or useful lives of the related assets.  Government grants that are receivables as compensation for expenses already incurred are deducted from  incurred expenses in the period in which they become receivables.       5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND  UNCERTAINTY    The Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and  will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the  pandemic.    In the application of the aforementioned Company’s accounting policies, the Company is required to make  judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not  readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical  experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these  estimates.    The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting  estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or  in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.    Critical Accounting Judgments    Revenue Recognition    The Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.    Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment  under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)    As described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the  assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are  available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions  necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.    Judgments on Lease Terms     In determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic  incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and  circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered  include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the  underlying asset to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in  circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs. Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty    Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances    Sales returns and other allowance is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in  consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the  related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.    Valuation of Inventory    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to  determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.    The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and  unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net  realizable value.  The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of  future demand within a specific time horizon.    Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill    In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible  assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected  future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of  semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business  strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.    Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets    Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be  available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the  deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and  profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any  changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could  result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.    Determination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates    In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company  mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status  in a similar economic environment.       6. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Deposits in banks consisted of highly liquid time deposits that were readily convertible to known amounts  of cash and were subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS The Company entered into forward exchange contracts to manage exposures due to fluctuations of foreign  exchange rates. These forward exchange contracts did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. Therefore,  the Company did not apply hedge accounting treatment for these forward exchange contracts.    Outstanding forward exchange contracts consisted of the following:            Contract Amount (Concluded)    These investments in equity instruments are held for medium to long-term purposes and therefore are  accounted for as FVTOCI. For dividends recognized from these investments, please refer to consolidated  statements of cash flows. All the dividends are from investments held at the end of the reporting period.    For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, as the Company adjusted its investment portfolio, equity  investments designated at FVTOCI were divested for NT$8 thousand and NT$873,470 thousand,  respectively. The related other equity-unrealized gain/loss on financial assets at FVTOCI of NT$108,996  thousand and NT$156,770 thousand were transferred to decrease and increase retained earnings,  respectively.    As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cumulative loss allowance for expected credit loss of NT$32,480  thousand and NT$35,596 thousand was recognized under investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI,  respectively. Refer to Note 32 for information relating to the credit risk management and expected credit  loss.       9. FINANCIAL ASSETS AT AMORTIZED COST Refer to Note 32 for information relating to credit risk management and expected credit loss for financial  assets at amortized cost. HEDGING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Fair value hedge    The Company entered into interest rate futures contracts, which are used to partially hedge against the fair  value changes caused by interest rate fluctuation in the Company’s fixed income investments. The hedge  ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%.    On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of the interest rate futures  contracts and the value of the hedged financial assets will change in opposite directions in response to  movements in interest rates.    The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the credit risk of the hedged  financial assets, which is not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate futures contracts. No other  sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Amount of  hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss is classified under other gains and losses.    The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of interest rate risk.    December 31, 2020 Cash flow hedge    The Company entered into forward exchange contracts to partially hedge foreign exchange rate risks  associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures). The hedge ratio is  adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward exchange  contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.    On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward exchange contracts  and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign  exchange rates.    The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the  counterparty’s own credit risk on the fair value of forward exchange contracts. No other sources of  ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and  2019, refer to Note 22(d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and  the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items.    The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges for foreign currency risk.    December 31, 2019 NOTES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET The Company signed a contract with the bank to sell certain accounts receivable without recourse and  transaction cost required. These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held  within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets.    In principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from  the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for  credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit  loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and  customers’ financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due  over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.    Aging analysis of notes and accounts receivable For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the changes in loss allowance were mainly due to the  variations in the balance of accounts receivable of different risk levels.      12. INVENTORIES The aforementioned reversal of write-down of inventories for the year ended December 31, 2019 excluded  wafer contamination losses. Please refer to related losses in Note 37.      13.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS    a. Defined contribution plans    The plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant  to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee’s  monthly salary to employees’ pension accounts. Furthermore, TSMC North America, TSMC China,  TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Europe, TSMC Canada and TSMC Technology also make monthly contributions  at certain percentages of the basic salary of their employees. Accordingly, the Company recognized  expenses of NT$2,809,484 thousand and NT$2,609,733 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020  and 2019, respectively.    b. Defined benefit plans    TSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on  an employee’s length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement.  The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension  funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the  Committee) and deposited in the Committee’s name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year,  the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate  to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the  Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of  March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government’s designated authorities;  as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.    Amounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:        Years Ended December 31      2020    2019 LONG-TERM BANK LOANS       2020 Unsecured loans        $  2,000,000  Less: Discounts on government grants          (32,389)                      $  1,967,611          Loan content        Annual interest rate       0.4%  Maturity date       Due by Note: The Company has an additional 20 percent pay raise in 2021.    Through the defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to  the following risks:    1) Investment risk: The pension funds are invested in equity and debt securities, bank deposits, etc.  The investment is conducted at the discretion of the government’s designated authorities or under  the mandated management. However, under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the rate of return on  assets shall not be less than the average interest rate on a two-year time deposit published by the  local banks and the government is responsible for any shortfall in the event that the rate of return is  less than the required rate of return.    2) Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the  defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the  debt investments of the plan assets.    Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a  decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held  constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$694,732  thousand and NT$724,963 thousand as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by  qualified actuaries. The principal assumptions of the actuarial valuation were as follows:        Measurement Date Future salary increase rate      3.00%(Note)   3.00%  Discount rate      0.40%    0.90% 3) Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the  future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will  increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.    Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other  assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase  by NT$835,964 thousand and NT$706,502 thousand as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,  respectively.    The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined  benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one  another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.     Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit  obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period,  which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.    The Company expects to make contributions of NT$229,934 thousand to the defined benefit plans in  the next year starting from December 31, 2020. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit  obligation is 9 years.      21. GUARANTEE DEPOSITS Some of guarantee deposits were refunded to customers by offsetting related accounts receivable.      22. EQUITY    a. Capital stock A holder of issued common shares with par value of NT$10 per share is entitled to vote and to receive  dividends. Under the relevant laws, the capital surplus generated from donations and the excess of the issuance price  over the par value of capital stock (including the stock issued for new capital, mergers and convertible  bonds) may be used to offset a deficit; in addition, when the Company has no deficit, such capital surplus  may be distributed as cash dividends or stock dividends up to a certain percentage of TSMC’s paid-in  capital. The capital surplus from share of changes in equities of subsidiaries and associates and dividend  of a claim extinguished by a prescription may be used to offset a deficit; however, when generated from  issuance of restricted shares for employees, such capital surplus may not be used for any purpose.    c. Retained earnings and dividend policy    The amendments to TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation had been approved by TSMC’s shareholders in its  meeting held on June 5, 2019, which stipulate that earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis  after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by  TSMC’s Board of Directors and reported to TSMC’s shareholders in its meeting.    TSMC’s amended Articles of Incorporation provide that, when allocating earnings, TSMC shall first  estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the  remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC’s paid-in capital), then set  aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the  authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and the TSMC’s  Articles of Incorporation.    TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash  dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of  cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the  ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.    The reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion  in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.    Pursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside additional special capital reserve  equivalent to the net debit balance of the other components of stockholders’ equity, such as the  accumulated balance of foreign currency translation reserve, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair  value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of  hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to The authorized shares include 500,000 thousand shares allocated for the exercise of employee stock  options.    As of December 31, 2020, 1,064,364 thousand ADSs of TSMC were traded on the NYSE. The number  of common shares represented by the ADSs was 5,321,819 thousand shares (one ADS represents five  common shares).    b. Capital surplus Others    Changes in others were as follows:        Year Ended December 31, 2020 stockholders’ equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit  balance reverses.    The appropriations of 2020 and 2019 quarterly earnings have been approved by TSMC’s Board of  Directors in its meeting, respectively. The appropriations and cash dividends per share were as follows:       Fourth Quarter  Third Quarter  Second Quarter   First Quarter The special capital reserve for 2020 is to be presented for approval in the TSMC’s shareholders’ meeting  to be held on June 8, 2021 (expected).    The appropriation of 2018 earnings has been approved by TSMC’s shareholders in its meeting held on  June 5, 2019. The appropriation and cash dividends per share were as follows: Legal capital reserve     $ 35,113,088    Special capital reserve     $ (11,459,458)    Cash dividends to shareholders     $ 207,443,044    $  8.0 Cash dividends to shareholders     $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951  Cash dividends per share (NT$)     $  2.5    $  2.5    $  2.5    $  2.5 Cash dividends to shareholders     $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951    $ 51,860,761  Cash dividends per share (NT$)     $  2.5    $  2.5    $  2.5    $  2.0 The aforementioned other equity includes the changes in other equities of TSMC and TSMC’s share of  its subsidiaries and associates.

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT    The Company requires significant amounts of capital to build and expand its production facilities and acquire  additional equipment. In consideration of the industry dynamics, the Company manages its capital in a  manner to ensure that it has sufficient and necessary financial resources to fund its working capital needs,  capital asset purchases, research and development activities, dividend payments, debt service requirements  and other business requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.      32. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    a. Categories of financial instruments Note 1: Financial assets mandatorily measured at FVTPL. Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities                Non-cash changes Note 2: Including notes and accounts receivable (net), equity and debt investments.    Note 3: Including cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at amortized cost, notes and accounts  receivable (including related parties), other receivables and refundable deposits.

Note 5: Including short-term loans, accounts payable (including related parties), payables to contractors  and equipment suppliers, cash dividends payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities,  bonds payable, long-term bank loans and guarantee deposits.    b. Financial risk management objectives    The Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit  risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties  may have on its financial performance.    The plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by Audit Committees and/or Board of Directors in  accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the  implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide  guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.    c. Market risk     The Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange  rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.    Foreign currency risk    The majority of the Company’s revenue is denominated in U.S. dollar and over one-half of its capital  expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollar, Japanese yen  and Euro. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in exchanges rate of NT dollar  against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse  impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollar. The Company uses foreign currency  derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange  rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted  transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange  rate movements on the assets and liabilities.    Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s total monetary assets and liabilities for the  years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change  of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$897,722 thousand and NT$2,137,338 thousand,  respectively, and decreased its other comprehensive income NT$107,690 thousand for the year ended  December 31, 2019, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.    Interest rate risk    The Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily related to its investment portfolio and outstanding  debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and  fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.    The Company’s cash and cash equivalents as well as fixed income investments in both fixed- and floating- rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. The majority of the Company’s fixed income  investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, and may have  their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rate fall, cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected.  The Company has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate futures to partially hedge the  interest rate risk on its fixed income investments. However, these hedges can offset only a small portion  of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.    Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s fixed income investments at the end of the  reporting period, interest rates increase of 100 basis points (1.00%) across all maturities would have  decreased the fair value by NT$3,143,569 thousand and NT$3,517,424 thousand for the years ended  December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decreases were composed of NT$3,143,569 thousand  decrease and NT$3,516,604 thousand decrease in other comprehensive income for the years ended  December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and NT$820 thousand decrease in net income for the year  ended December 31, 2019.    The majority of the Company’s short-term debt is floating-rate, hence a rise in interest rates may result  in higher interest expense than predicted. The majority of the Company’s long-term debt is fixed-rate and  measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows  and the carrying amount.    Other price risk    The Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTOCI.     Assuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the equity investments at the end of the reporting  period for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the other comprehensive income would have  decreased by NT$446,470 thousand and NT$401,879 thousand, respectively.    d. Credit risk management    Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in  financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities,  primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments  and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and  financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company’s maximum credit risk  exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.    Business related credit risk    The Company’s accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company’s  outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has  procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such  procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during  periods when economic conditions worsen.    As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s ten largest customers accounted for 79% of accounts  receivable in both years. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the remaining  accounts receivable not material.    Financial credit risk    The Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment grade credit  ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and  reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the  credit standing of the counterparties.    The objective of the Company’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to  preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires securities to be For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the expected credit loss increases NT$1,054 thousand  and NT$655 thousand, respectively. The changes are mainly due to investment portfolio adjustment and  changes in credit rating of investment securities.    e. Liquidity risk management    The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its  business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining  adequate cash and cash equivalents, fixed income investments at FVTPL, financial assets at FVTOCI- current, financial assets at amortized cost-current and sufficient cost-efficient funding.    The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities based on  contractual undiscounted payments, including principal and interest. investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company assesses  whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk in the invested securities� since initial  recognition by reviewing changes in external credit ratings, financial market conditions and material  information of the issuers.    The Company assesses the 12-month expected credit loss and lifetime expected credit loss based on the  probability of default and loss given default provided by external credit rating agencies. The current credit  risk assessment policies are as follows: 0-0.1% Fair value of financial instruments    1) Fair value measurements recognized in the consolidated balance sheets    Fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value  is observable:    � Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active  markets for identical assets or liabilities;  � Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included  within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or  indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and  � Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs  for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).    The timing of transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy is at the end of reporting  period.    2) Fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis    Fair value hierarchy    The following table presents the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on  a recurring basis:        December 31, 2020 (Concluded)    The transfer from Level 2 to Level 1 is because quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets  became available for such equity investment. Note: The transfer from Level 3 to Level 2 is because observable market data became available for  such equity investment.    Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 2 fair value measurement    The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:    � The fair values of corporate bonds, agency bonds, agency mortgage-backed securities,  asset-backed securities, government bonds and non-publicly traded equity investments - equity  investments trading on the Emerging Stock Board are determined by quoted market prices  provided by third party pricing services.  � Forward exchange contracts are measured using forward exchange rates and discount rates  derived from quoted market prices.  � The fair value of accounts receivable classified as at FVTOCI is determined by the present  value of future cash flows based on the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of  counterparties.    Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 3 fair value measurement    The fair values of non-publicly traded equity investments (excluding those trading on the Emerging  Stock Board) are mainly determined by using the asset approach and market approach.    The asset approach takes into account the net asset value measured at the fair value by independent  parties. On December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company uses unobservable inputs derived from  discount for lack of marketability by 10%. When other inputs remain equal, the fair value will  decrease by NT$39,006 thousand and NT34,843 thousand if discounts for lack of marketability  increase by 1%.    For the remaining few investments, the market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for  which the recent financing activities of investees, the market transaction prices of the similar  companies and market conditions are considered.    In addition, the fair values of convertible bonds are determined by the present value of future cash  flow based on a discount rate reflecting issuer’s credit spread and market conditions, combined with  the fair value of conversion option estimated by the option pricing model considering recent  financing activities of the investee and market transaction prices of the similar companies. Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements of financial assets    The financial assets measured at Level 3 fair value were financial assets at FVTPL and equity  investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI. Reconciliations for the years ended December  31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:        Years Ended December 31 Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 2 fair value measurement    The fair values of corporate bonds and the Company’s bonds payable are determined by quoted  market prices provided by third party pricing services. 3) Fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value    Except as detailed in the following table, the Company considers that the carrying amounts of  financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements that are not measured at fair value  approximate their fair values.    Fair value hierarchy    The table below sets out the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities  which are not required to measure at fair value:        December 31, 2020 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS    Intercompany balances and transactions between TSMC and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of  TSMC, have been eliminated upon consolidation; therefore those items are not disclosed in this note. The  following is a summary of significant transactions between the Company and other related parties:    a. Related party name and categories Net revenue Purchases Receivables from related parties Others The sales prices and payment terms to related parties were not significantly different from those of sales  to third parties. For other related party transactions, price and terms were determined in accordance with  mutual agreements.    The Company leased factory and office from associates. The lease terms and prices were both  determined in accordance with mutual agreements. The rental expenses were paid to associates  monthly; the related expenses were both classified under manufacturing expenses.    g. Compensation of key management personnel    The compensation to directors and other key management personnel were as follows:        Years Ended December 31 The compensation to directors and other key management personnel were determined by the  Compensation Committee of TSMC in accordance with the individual performance and the market  trends. Payables to related parties PLEDGED ASSETS    The Company provided certificate of deposits recorded in other financial assets as collateral mainly for  building lease agreements. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aforementioned other financial assets  amounted to NT$135,375 thousand and NT$114,467 thousand, respectively.      35. SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND UNRECOGNIZED COMMITMENTS    Significant contingent liabilities and unrecognized commitments of the Company as of the end of the  reporting period, excluding those disclosed in other notes, were as follows:    a. Under a technical cooperation agreement with Industrial Technology Research Institute, the R.O.C.  Government or its designee approved by TSMC can use up to 35% of TSMC’s capacity provided  TSMC’s outstanding commitments to its customers are not prejudiced. The term of this agreement is for  five years beginning from January 1, 1987 and is automatically renewed for successive periods of five  years unless otherwise terminated by either party with one year prior notice. As of December 31, 2020,  the R.O.C. Government did not invoke such right.    b. Under a Shareholders Agreement entered into with Philips and EDB Investments Pte Ltd. on March 30,  1999, the parties formed a joint venture company, SSMC, which is an integrated circuit foundry in  Singapore. TSMC’s equity interest in SSMC was 32%. Nevertheless, in September 2006, Philips  spun-off its semiconductor subsidiary which was renamed as NXP B.V. Further, TSMC and NXP B.V.  purchased all the SSMC shares owned by EDB Investments Pte Ltd. pro rata according to the  Shareholders Agreement on November 15, 2006. After the purchase, TSMC and NXP B.V. currently  own approximately 39% and 61% of the SSMC shares, respectively. TSMC and NXP B.V. are  required, in the aggregate, to purchase at least 70% of SSMC’s capacity, but TSMC alone is not  required to purchase more than 28% of the capacity. If any party defaults on the commitment and the  capacity utilization of SSMC falls below a specific percentage of its capacity, the defaulting party is  required to compensate SSMC for all related unavoidable costs. There was no default from the  aforementioned commitment as of December 31, 2020.    c. On September 28, 2017, TSMC was contacted by the European Commission (the “Commission”),  which asked us for information and documents concerning alleged anti-competitive practices in relation  to semiconductor sales. We cooperated continuously with the Commission to provide the requested  information and documents. The Commission subsequently decided to close the investigation in May  2020.    d. TSMC entered into long-term purchase agreements of materials and supplies with multiple suppliers.  The relative minimum purchase quantity and price are specified in the agreements.  e. TSMC entered into a long-term purchase agreement of equipment. The relative purchase quantity and  price are specified in the agreement.    f. TSMC entered into long-term energy purchase agreements with multiple suppliers. The relative  purchase period, quantity and price are specified in the agreements.    g. Amounts available under unused letters of credit as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were NT$56,194  thousand and NT$59,976 thousand, respectively. EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION OF FOREIGN-CURRENCY FINANCIAL ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES    The following information was summarized according to the foreign currencies other than the functional  currency of the Company. The exchange rates disclosed were used to translate the foreign currencies into  the functional currency.

As part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China, we  exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:    1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the parent company only financial statements,  whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain  audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting  a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may  involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.    2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are  appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the  Company’s internal control.    3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and  related disclosures made by management.    4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based  on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may  cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a  material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures  in the parent company only financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However,  future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.    5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the parent company only financial statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the parent company only financial statements represent the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.    6. Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business  activities within the Company to express an opinion on the parent company only financial statements. We  are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely  responsible for our audit opinion.    We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and  timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that  we identify during our audit.    We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical  requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that  may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.    From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of  most significance in the audit of the parent company only financial statements for the year ended December 31,  2020 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or  regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine  that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would  reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    For the convenience of readers, the accompanying parent company only financial statements have been  translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in the R.O.C. If there is any  conflict between the English version and the original Chinese version or any difference in the interpretation  of the two versions, the Chinese-language parent company only financial statements shall prevail.    Statement of Compliance    The accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the  Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers (the “Accounting Standards  Used in Preparation of the Parent Company Only Financial Statements”).    Basis of Preparation     The accompanying parent company only financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis  except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below.  Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.    When preparing the parent company only financial statements, the Company account for subsidiaries and  associates by using the equity method. In order to agree with the amount of net income, other comprehensive  income and equity attributable to shareholders of the parent in the consolidated financial statements, the  differences of the accounting treatment between the parent company only basis and the consolidated basis  are adjusted under the heading of investments accounted for using equity method, share of profits of  subsidiaries and associates and share of other comprehensive income of subsidiaries and associates in the  parent company only financial statements.    Foreign Currencies    In preparing the parent company only financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s  functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the  transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are  retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in  the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign The IFRSs issued by IASB but not yet endorsed and issued into effect by the FSC currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange  differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except  for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and  losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are  also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of  historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.    For the purposes of presenting parent company only financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the  Company’s foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each  reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.  Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in  equity.    Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities    Current assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or  consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred  for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting  period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.    Cash Equivalents    Cash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time  deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an  insignificant risk of changes in value.    Financial Instruments    Financial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual  provisions of the instruments.    Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly  attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets  and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the  financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly  attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are  recognized immediately in profit or loss.    Financial Assets    The classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is  determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized  and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the  same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require  delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.    a. Category of financial assets and measurement     Financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in  debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.     1) Financial asset at FVTPL    For certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized  cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss  incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.     2) Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI    Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal  and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual  cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.    Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and  impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or  loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other  comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are  disposed.     3) Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI    On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments  that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.    Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and  losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated  in other equity.    Dividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss  when the Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, unless the Company’s rights clearly  represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.     4) Measured at amortized cost    Cash and cash equivalents, debt instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including  related parties), other receivables and refundable deposits are measured at amortized cost.    Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal  and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding financial assets  in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost.    Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at  amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less any  impairment loss.    b. Impairment of financial assets    At the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial  assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are  measured at FVTOCI.     The loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit  losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at  FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial  recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from  possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other  hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is  recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the  expected life of a financial instrument. The Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a  corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except for  investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized  in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset.    c. Derecognition of financial assets    The Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the  financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards  of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.     On derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s  carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss.  On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset’s  carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss  that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on  derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had  been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without  recycling through profit or loss.    Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments    Classification as debt or equity    Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity  in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability  and an equity instrument.    Equity instruments    An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting  all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net  of direct issue costs.    Financial liabilities    Financial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at  FVTPL.    Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either  held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.     Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising  on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.    Financial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently  measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.    Derecognition of financial liabilities    The Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are  discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability  derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss. Derivative Financial Instruments    Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are  entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The  resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is  designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or  loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.    Hedge Accounting    Cash flow hedge    The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, to partially  hedge its foreign exchange rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital  expenditures). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in  other comprehensive income. When the forecast transactions actually take place, the associated gains or  losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and included in the  initial cost of the hedged items. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective  portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.     The Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to  meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or  exercised.     Inventories    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost  and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value  represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs  necessary to make the sale.    Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method    Investments accounted for using the equity method include investments in subsidiaries and associates.     Investment in subsidiaries    A subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Company.    Under the equity method, an investment in a subsidiary is initially recognized at cost and adjusted thereafter  to recognize the Company’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the subsidiary as  well as the distribution received. The Company also recognized its share in the changes in the equity of  subsidiaries.    Changes in the Company’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing  control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. Any difference between the carrying  amount of the subsidiary and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in  equity.    When the Company loses control of a subsidiary, any retained investment of the former subsidiary is  measured at the fair value at that date. A gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and calculated as the  difference between (a) the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any  retained interest at the date when control is lost; and (b) the previous carrying amount of the investments in  such subsidiary. In addition, the Company shall account for all amounts previously recognized in other  comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the subsidiary  had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities. When the Company transacts with its subsidiaries, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with  the subsidiaries are recognized in the Company’s parent company only financial statements only to the  extent of interests in the subsidiaries that are not owned by the Company.    Investment in associates    An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary  nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy  decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.    The operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these parent company only  financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an  associate is initially recognized in the statement of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to  recognize the Company’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate as well as  the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.    Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable  assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized  as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company’s  share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of  acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.    When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment  as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell)  with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the  investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of  the investment subsequently increases.    When the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing  ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the  Company’s proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference  as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the  Company’s ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by  other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other  comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as  would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.     When the Company transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the  associate are recognized in the Company’s parent company only financial statements only to the extent of  interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company. Property, Plant and Equipment    Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated  impairment. Costs include any incremental costs that are directly attributable to the construction or  acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment.    Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative  purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Such assets are classified to the  appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use.  Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other identical categories of property, plant and  equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.    Depreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful  lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives:   buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery  and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 5 years; and office  equipment - 5 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at  the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective  basis. Land is not depreciated.    An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic  benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal  or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.    Leases    For a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to  account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.    The Company as lessor    Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.    The Company as lessee    Except for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment  and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use  assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.    Right-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement  of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement  date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets. Subsequent measurement is  calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes  in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are  presented separately in the parent company only balance sheets.    Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the  earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease  transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of  right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the  right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed  payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase  option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted  using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rates.    Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with  interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future  lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change  in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities  with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line  in the parent company only balance sheets.    Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the periods  in which they are incurred.    Intangible Assets    Goodwill    Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of  the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.    Other intangible assets    Other separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated  amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method  over the following estimated useful lives:  Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or  the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period;  patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method  are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted  for on a prospective basis.    Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets    Goodwill    Goodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is  an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing,  goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash generating units or groups of cash-generating units that  are expected to benefit. If the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount,  the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such  cash-generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying  amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in  profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.    Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets    At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets  (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is  any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the  recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When  it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the  recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and  consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual  cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for  which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,  the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that  reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which  the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.    If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,  the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An  impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.    When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit  is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not  exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for  the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately  in profit or loss.    Guarantee Deposit    Guarantee deposit mainly consists of cash received under deposit agreements with customers to ensure they  have access to the Company’s specified capacity. Cash received from customers is recorded as guarantee  deposit upon receipt. Guarantee deposits are refunded to customers when terms and conditions set forth in  the deposit agreements have been satisfied.    Revenue Recognition    The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations  are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods which is generally when the goods are  delivered to the customers’ specified locations.    Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.  Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales  returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the  consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued  expenses and other current liabilities.    In principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the  end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of  goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts  without discounting.    Employee Benefits    Short-term employee benefits    Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount  of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.    Retirement benefits    For defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense  when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement  benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations. Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit  retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including  current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee  benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the  return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in  which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in  retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.     Net defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.     Taxation    Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.    Current tax    Income tax on unappropriated earnings is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation  of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.    Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision.    Deferred tax    Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  in the parent company only financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of  taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences.  Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss  carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that  taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.     Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in  subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary  difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only  recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to  utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.    The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to  the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of  the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also  reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient  taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.    Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in  which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted  or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and  assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at  the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.    Current and deferred tax for the year    Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are  recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax  are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND  UNCERTAINTY    The Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and  will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the  pandemic.    In the application of the aforementioned Company’s accounting policies, the Company is required to make  judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily  apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience  and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.    The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting  estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or  in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.    Critical Accounting Judgments    Revenue Recognition    The Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.    Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment  under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)    As described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the  assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are  available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions  necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.    Judgments on Lease Terms     In determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic  incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances  from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include  contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset  to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are  within the control of the Company occurs.    Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty    Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances    Sales returns and other allowance is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in  consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the  related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.    Valuation of Inventory    Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine  the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.    The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and  unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable  value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand  within a specific time horizon. Deposits in banks consisted of highly liquid time deposits that were readily convertible to known amounts of  cash and were subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.       7. FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill    In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible  assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future  revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of  semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business  strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.    Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets    Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available  against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets  requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays,  the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global  economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant  adjustments to the deferred tax assets.    Determination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates    In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company  mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status  in a similar economic environment.       6. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS The Company entered into forward exchange contracts to manage exposures due to fluctuations of foreign  exchange rates. These forward exchange contracts did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. Therefore,  the Company did not apply hedge accounting treatment for these forward exchange contracts. HEDGING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company entered into forward exchange contracts to partially hedge foreign exchange rate risks  associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures). The hedge ratio is  adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward exchange  contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.     On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward exchange contracts  and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign  exchange rates.     The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the  counterparty’s own credit risk on the fair value of forward exchange contracts. No other sources of  ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and  2019, refer to Note 19(d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and  the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items.    The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges for foreign currency risk.     December 31, 2019 NOTES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET The Company signed a contract with the bank to sell certain accounts receivable without recourse and  transaction cost required. These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held  within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling  financial assets.    In principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from  the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for  credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit  loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and  customers’ financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due  over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.    Aging analysis of notes and accounts receivable For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the changes in loss allowance were mainly due to the  variations in the balance of accounts receivable of different risk levels.      10. INVENTORIES The aforementioned reversal of write-down of inventories for the year ended December 31, 2019 excluded  wafer contamination losses. Please refer to related losses in Note 33.      11. INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING EQUITY METHOD    Investments accounted for using the equity method consisted of the following: Write-down of inventories to net realizable value and reversal of write-down of inventories resulting from  the increase in net realizable value were included in the cost of revenue, as illustrated below:        Years Ended December 31    All of the Company’s accounts receivable classified as at FVTOCI were not past due.    Movements of the loss allowance for accounts receivable The Company established a subsidiary in November 2020 and invested in TSMC Arizona for the  amount of NT$855,599 thousand.     The Company established a subsidiary in January 2020 and continually increased its investment in  TSMC JDC for the amount of NT$302,560 thousand.      b. Investments in associates    Associates consisted of the following: Investments in subsidiaries    Subsidiaries consisted of the following: TSMC Global Ltd.  (TSMC Global) TSMC Partners, Ltd. TSMC Europe B.V.  (TSMC Europe) Company Limited  (TSMC Nanjing)  Company Ltd.  (VisEra Tech) Japan, Inc. (TSMC  JDC)  Fund III, L.P.  (VTAF III) Fund II, L.P.  (VTAF II) U.S.A.  Virgin Islands California,  U.S.A. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Assets used by the Company (Concluded)    As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no investments in associates are individually material to the  Company.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS    a. Defined contribution plans    The plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant  to the Act, the Company has made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee’s monthly salary  to employees’ pension accounts. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$2,309,527  thousand and NT$2,063,508 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.    b. Defined benefit plans    The Company has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits  based on an employee’s length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to  retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their  respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory  Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee’s name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the  end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the  Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in  the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made  before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government’s  designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of  the Funds.    Amounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:        Years Ended December 31      2020    2019 - 149 - - 37 -     US$1,000,000   2.70%   Bullet repayment Note: The Company has an additional 20 percent pay raise in 2021.    Through the defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to  the following risks:    1) Investment risk: The pension funds are invested in equity and debt securities, bank deposits, etc. The  investment is conducted at the discretion of the government’s designated authorities or under the  mandated management. However, under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the rate of return on assets  shall not be less than the average interest rate on a two-year time deposit published by the local banks  and the government is responsible for any shortfall in the event that the rate of return is less than the  required rate of return.    2) Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the  defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the  debt investments of the plan assets.    Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a  decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held  constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$694,732 thousand  and NT$724,963 thousand as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.    3) Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the future  salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase  the present value of the defined benefit obligation.    Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other  assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by  NT$835,964 thousand and NT$706,502 thousand as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.    The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined  benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another  as some of the assumptions may be correlated. The actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by qualified  actuaries. The principal assumptions of the actuarial valuation were as follows:        Measurement Date Future salary increase rate    3.00% (Note)   3.00% Discount rate     0.40%    0.90% Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit  obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period,  which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.    The Company expects to make contributions of NT$229,934 thousand to the defined benefit plans in  the next year starting from December 31, 2020. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit  obligation is 9 years.      18. GUARANTEE DEPOSITS Some of guarantee deposits were refunded to customers by offsetting related accounts receivable.      19. EQUITY    a. Capital stock A holder of issued common shares with par value of NT$10 per share is entitled to vote and to receive  dividends.    The authorized shares include 500,000 thousand shares allocated for the exercise of employee stock  options.    As of December 31, 2020, 1,064,364 thousand ADSs of the Company were traded on the NYSE. The  number of common shares represented by the ADSs was 5,321,819 thousand shares (one ADS  represents five common shares). Under the relevant laws, the capital surplus generated from donations and the excess of the issuance  price over the par value of capital stock (including the stock issued for new capital, mergers and  convertible bonds) may be used to offset a deficit; in addition, when the Company has no deficit, such  capital surplus may be distributed as cash dividends or stock dividends up to a certain percentage of the  Company’s paid-in capital. The capital surplus from share of changes in equities of subsidiaries and  associates and dividend of a claim extinguished by a prescription may be used to offset a deficit;  however, when generated from issuance of restricted shares for employees, such capital surplus may not  be used for any purpose.    c. Retained earnings and dividend policy    The amendments to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation had been approved by the Company’s  shareholders in its meeting held on June 5, 2019, which stipulate that earnings distribution may be made  on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends  should be approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and reported to the Company’s shareholders  in its meeting.    The Company’s amended Articles of Incorporation provide that, when allocating earnings, the  Company shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital  reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals the  Company’s paid-in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or  regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated  according to relevant laws and the Company’s Articles of Incorporation.    The Company’s Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of the Company may be distributed  by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made  preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock  dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.    The reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the  portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.    Pursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside additional special capital reserve  equivalent to the net debit balance of the other components of stockholders’ equity, such as the  accumulated balance of foreign currency translation reserve, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair  value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of  hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to  stockholders’ equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit  balance reverses. Capital surplus Others    Changes in others were as follows:      Year Ended December 31, 2020 The appropriations of 2020 and 2019 quarterly earnings have been approved by the Company’s Board of  Directors in its meeting, respectively. The appropriations and cash dividends per share were as follows:       Fourth Quarter  Third Quarter  Second Quarter   First Quarter The special capital reserve for 2020 is to be presented for approval in the the Company’s shareholders’  meeting to be held on June 8, 2021 (expected).    The appropriation of 2018 earnings has been approved by the Company’s shareholders in its meeting held  on June 5, 2019. The appropriation and cash dividends per share were as follows: Legal capital reserve     $ 35,113,088    Special capital reserve     $ (11,459,458)    Cash dividends to shareholders     $ 207,443,044    $  8.0 Cash dividends to shareholders     $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951  Cash dividends per share (NT$)     $  2.5    $  2.5    $  2.5    $  2.5 Cash dividends to shareholders     $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951    $ 64,825,951    $ 51,860,761  Cash dividends per share (NT$)     $  2.5    $  2.5    $  2.5    $  2.0 The aforementioned other equity includes the changes in other equities of the Company and the  Company’s share of its subsidiaries and associates.      20. NET REVENUE    a. Disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers        Years Ended December 31     Product    2020    2019 The Company categorized the net revenue mainly based on the countries where the customers are  headquartered. The changes in the contract liability balances primarily result from the timing difference between the  satisfaction of performance obligation and the customer’s payment.    The Company recognized revenue from the beginning balance of contract liability, which amounted to  NT$3,843,787 thousand and NT$2,192,221 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019,  respectively.    c. Refund liabilities    Estimated sales returns and other allowances is made and adjusted based on historical experience and  the consideration of varying contractual terms, which amounted to NT$38,937,425 thousand and  NT$33,893,735 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of  December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aforementioned refund liabilities amounted to NT$30,995,223  thousand and NT$17,673,937 thousand (classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities),  respectively.

Income tax expense recognized in other comprehensive income Deferred income tax balance    The analysis of deferred income tax assets and liabilities was as follows: The information of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities associated with investments    As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate taxable temporary differences associated with  investments in subsidiaries not recognized as deferred income tax liabilities amounted to  NT$152,827,360 thousand and NT$131,085,673 thousand, respectively.    g. Income tax examination    The tax authorities have examined income tax returns of the Company through 2018. All investment tax  credit adjustments assessed by the tax authorities have been recognized accordingly.      25.

CASH FLOW INFORMATION    a. Non-cash transactions Reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities Note:  Other changes include amortization of bonds payable, financial cost of lease liabilities and guarantee deposits  refunded to customers by offsetting related accounts receivable.      28. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT    The Company requires significant amounts of capital to build and expand its production facilities and  acquire additional equipment. In consideration of the industry dynamics, the Company manages its capital  in a manner to ensure that it has sufficient and necessary financial resources to fund its working capital  needs, capital asset purchases, research and development activities, dividend payments, debt service  requirements and other business requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12  months.      29. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    a. Categories of financial instruments Note 1: Financial assets mandatorily measured at FVTPL.    Note 2: Including notes and accounts receivable (net) and equity investments.    Note 3: Including cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at amortized cost, notes and accounts  receivable (including related parties), other receivables and refundable deposits.    Note 4: Held for trading.     Note 5: Including short-term loans, accounts payable (including related parties), payables to  contractors and equipment suppliers, cash dividends payable, accrued expenses and other  current liabilities, bonds payable and guarantee deposits. Financial risk management objectives    The Company manages its exposure to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk, credit  risk and liquidity risk with the objective to reduce the potentially adverse effects the market uncertainties  may have on its financial performance.    The plans for material treasury activities are reviewed by Audit Committees and/or Board of Directors in  accordance with procedures required by relevant regulations or internal controls. During the  implementation of such plans, the Company must comply with certain treasury procedures that provide  guiding principles for overall financial risk management and segregation of duties.    c. Market risk     The Company is exposed to the financial market risks, primarily changes in foreign currency exchange  rates, interest rates and equity investment prices. A portion of these risks is hedged.    Foreign currency risk    The majority of the Company’s revenue is denominated in U.S. dollar and over one-half of its capital  expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollar, Japanese yen  and Euro. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in exchanges rate of NT dollar  against such currencies, in particular a weakening of U.S. dollar against NT dollar, would have an adverse  impact on the revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollar. The Company uses foreign currency  derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange  rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted  transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange  rate movements on the assets and liabilities.    Based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the Company’s total monetary assets and liabilities for the  years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate change  of 10% would have decreased its net income by NT$832,231 thousand and NT$2,112,450 thousand,  respectively, and decreased its other comprehensive income by NT$107,690 thousand for the year ended  December 31, 2019, after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions.    Interest rate risk    The Company is exposed to interest rate risks primarily related to its bank deposits and bank loans.  Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s bank deposits, as well as the interest  paid on its bank loans. Because all of the Company’s bonds issued are fixed-rate and measured at  amortized cost, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows and the carrying amount.    Other price risk    The Company is exposed to equity price risk arising from financial assets at FVTOCI.    Assuming a hypothetical decrease of 10% in prices of the equity investments at the end of the reporting  period for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the other comprehensive income would have  decreased by NT$73,464 thousand and NT$77,156 thousand, respectively.    d. Credit risk management    Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in  financial losses to the Company. The Company is exposed to credit risks from operating activities,  primarily accounts receivable, and from investing activities, primarily deposits, fixed-income investments  and other financial instruments with banks. Credit risk is managed separately for business related and financial related exposures. As of the end of the reporting period, the Company’s maximum credit risk  exposure is equal to the carrying amount of financial assets.    Business related credit risk    The Company’s accounts receivable are from its customers worldwide. The majority of the Company’s  outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collaterals or guarantees. While the Company has  procedures to monitor and manage credit risk exposure on accounts receivable, there is no assurance such  procedures will effectively eliminate losses resulting from its credit risk. This risk is heightened during  periods when economic conditions worsen.    As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s ten largest customers accounted for 67% and 83%  of accounts receivable, respectively. The Company considers the concentration of credit risk for the  remaining accounts receivable not material.    Financial credit risk    The Company mitigates its financial credit risk by selecting counterparties with investment-grade credit  ratings and by limiting the exposure to any individual counterparty. The Company regularly monitors and  reviews the limit applied to counterparties and adjusts the limit according to market conditions and the  credit standing of the counterparties.    e. Liquidity risk management    The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its  business operations over the next 12 months. The Company manages its liquidity risk by maintaining  adequate cash and cash equivalent.    The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities based on  contractual undiscounted payments, including principal and interest. Fair value of financial instruments    1) Fair value measurements recognized in the parent company only balance sheets    Fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value  is observable:    � Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active  markets for identical assets or liabilities;  � Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included  within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or  indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and  � Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs  for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 2 fair value measurement    The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows:    � Forward exchange contracts are measured using forward exchange rates and discount rates  derived from quoted market prices.     � The fair value of accounts receivable classified as at FVTOCI is determined by the present value  of future cash flows based on the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparties.    Valuation techniques and assumptions used in Level 3 fair value measurement    The fair values of non-publicly traded equity investments are mainly determined by using the asset  approach and market approach.     The asset approach takes into account the net asset value measured at the fair value by independent  parties.    The market approach is used to arrive at their fair values, for which the recent financing activities of  investees, the market transaction prices of the similar companies and market conditions are  considered.    3) Fair value of financial instruments that are not measured at fair value    Except as detailed in the following table, the Company considers that the carrying amounts of  financial instruments in the parent company only financial statements that are not measured at fair  value approximate their fair values.    Fair value hierarchy    The table below sets out the fair value hierarchy for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities  which are not required to measure at fair value:        December 31, 2020 Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements of financial assets    The financial assets measured at Level 3 fair value were equity investments classified as financial  assets at FVTOCI. Reconciliations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:        Years Ended December 31      2020    2019 The fair value of the Company’s bonds payable is determined by quoted market prices provided by  third party pricing services.       30.

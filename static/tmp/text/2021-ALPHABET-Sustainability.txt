Google’s 2021 Environmental Report provides an update on the more  detailed information about our sustainability strategy that we shared in our  2020 Environmental Report. Our 2021 report covers our 2020 fiscal year  (January 1 to December 31, 2020) and includes data, performance highlights,  and progress against our targets. It also mentions notable targets set in 2021. throughout our business in five key ways: designing efficient data centers,  advancing carbon-free energy, creating sustainable workplaces, building  better devices and services, and empowering users with technology. initiatives, see Google’s Sustainability and Commitments websites, as well  as sustainability and related information. For more information about our  business, see About Google and Alphabet’s Investor Relations website. This report outlines how we’re driving positive environmental impact We believe that every business has the opportunity and obligation to protect  our planet. Sustainability is one of our core values at Google, and we strive   to build sustainability into everything we do. founding over 20 years ago. These are some of our key achievements over  the past two decades: 2007:	We	became	the	first	major	company	to	be	carbon	neutral	for	our	operations. 2017:	We	became	the	first	major	company	to	match	100%	of	our	annual	electricity	 use	with	renewable	energy,		which	we’ve	achieved	for	four	consecutive	years. 2020:	We	issued	$5.75	billion	in	sustainability	bonds—the	largest	sustainability	  or	green	bond	issuance	by	any	company	in	history. 2020:	We	compensated	for	our	legacy	carbon	footprint,	making	Google	the	first	 major	company	to	be	carbon	neutral	for	its	entire	operating	history. accelerating the transition to carbon-free energy and a circular economy,  empowering everyone with technology, and benefiting the people and   places where we operate (see Figure 1). We’ve been a leader on sustainability and climate change since Google’s 3 Google Environmental Report 2021 launched our third decade of climate action, and we’re now working toward   a new set of ambitious commitments. By 2030, we aim to: maximize the reuse of finite resources across our operations, products,   and supply chains and to enable others to do the same. We’re also working  to empower everyone with technology by committing to help 1 billion people  make more sustainable choices by 2022 through our core products. replenish more water than we consume by 2030 and to support water security  in communities where we operate. We’ll focus on three areas: enhancing our  stewardship of water resources across Google office campuses and data  centers; replenishing our water use and improving watershed health and  ecosystems in water-stressed communities; and sharing technology and tools  that help everyone predict, prevent, and recover from water stress. continue to lead and encourage others to join us in improving the health of our  planet. We’re proud of what we’ve achieved so far, and we’re energized to help  move the world closer to a more sustainable and carbon-free future for all. To accelerate the transition to a carbon-free economy, in 2020, we On average, a Google data center   is twice as energy efficient as a  typical enterprise data center.1 In 2020, we diverted 81% of  waste from our global data center  operations away from landfills. Compared with five years ago,   we now deliver around six times as  much computing power with the  same amount of electrical power. In 2020, 23% of components   used for server upgrades were  refurbished inventory. Performance highlights The following section provides a snapshot of our performance as of the end  of 2020—demonstrating how we’re strengthening our business by reducing  the environmental impact of our operations and working to empower people  everywhere to live more sustainably. environmental data table. For a more complete overview of our performance over time, see the 1.10   average	annual	PUE In 2020, the average annual PUE2   for our global fleet of data centers  was 1.10, compared with the industry  average of 1.593—meaning that  Google data centers use about   six times less overhead energy. 8.2	million	  components	resold In 2020, we wiped clean and resold  nearly 8.2 million components into  the secondary market for reuse   by other organizations. Whether someone is using Google  at home or as part of an organization  running Google Cloud or Google  Workspace, all products in our Cloud  are carbon neutral—meaning that  the operational GHG emissions  associated with running workloads  on our infrastructure have been  reduced through procurement of  renewable energy and any residual  emissions have been compensated  for with high-quality carbon credits.4 From 2010 to 2020, we signed  more than 55 agreements totaling  nearly 6 GW of renewable energy,  representing a commitment of  approximately $4 billion   through 2034. From 2011 to 2020, our renewable  energy purchasing resulted in a  cumulative 63% reduction in our  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, as  compared with a business-as-usual  scenario in which we didn’t procure  renewable energy via PPAs. From 2009 to 2020, over   1.5 million m2 (17 million ft2)   of Google office facilities   achieved LEED certification. In 2020, we reached a 71% landfill  diversion rate for waste from   our offices globally. In 2020, we matched 100%   of the electricity consumption of   our operations with renewable  energy purchases for the fourth  consecutive year. From 2011 to 2020, our carbon  intensity per unit of revenue   decreased by 87%. 27% of our LEED-certified square  footage has achieved a Platinum  rating and 58% a Gold rating. 9.7	million	lbs	  of	food	waste	prevented From 2014 to 2020, we   prevented a total of nearly   4.4 million kg (9.7 million lbs)   of waste in our cafés globally by  tracking pre-consumer food waste. Google is the world’s largest   annual corporate purchaser   of renewable energy, based on  renewable electricity purchased   in megawatt-hours (MWh). From  2010 to 2020, we purchased a   total of more than 55 million MWh   of renewable energy through PPAs,  via on-site generation, and from   the electric grids where our   facilities are located. Google has been carbon   neutral since 2007. Because   of our purchases of renewable  energy and procurement of   high-quality carbon credits,   we have compensated for our  operational GHG emissions. In 2020, we were the first major   tech company to achieve Alliance   for Water Stewardship certification   for our campuses in Mountain View  and Los Angeles, California, and  Dublin, Ireland. From 2017 to 2020, we installed  more than 3,600 EV charging ports  at our offices in the United States  and Canada. Our London office at 6 Pancras  Square was the first building   project in the world to receive   ILFI Zero Carbon Certification,  meaning that it was designed   and constructed and operates   with zero carbon impact. $3.3	billion	  in	investment	commitments From 2010 to 2020, we made  commitments to invest nearly   $3.3 billion in renewable energy  projects with an expected combined  capacity of approximately 8.7 GW.  These targeted investments   go beyond our purchases of  renewable energy for our own  operational footprint. As of September 14, 2020, we had  purchased enough high-quality  carbon credits to compensate   for our entire legacy carbon  footprint since our founding,   making Google the first major  company to be carbon neutral   for its entire operating history. All shipments of Made by Google  products to and from direct  customers are carbon neutral.5 From 2011 to 2020, Nest   thermostats helped customers  cumulatively save more than   65 billion kWh of energy—  enough to power all of   San Francisco’s electricity   consumption for over 11 years. Google Maps provides, on   average, more than 1 billion  kilometers’ (621 million miles’)   worth of transit results per day,  helping to limit carbon emissions   by giving people access to mass  transit options, bike routes,   and traffic information. Earth Engine has enabled tens   of thousands of active users   around the world to easily   analyze over 40 petabytes10   of freely available geospatial  information, resulting in a deeper  understanding of the planet. From 2019 to 2020, we reduced   total transportation emissions   of Google hardware products   by 38% per metric ton shipped. In 2020 alone, Nest thermostats  helped customers save more than   18 billion kWh of energy—more  energy than Google used in 2020. By the end of 2020, Google Maps  contained nearly 180,000 EV  charging locations globally. In 2020, Google.org launched  the Impact Challenge on Climate,  committing €10 million to fund bold  ideas that aim to use technology to  accelerate Europe’s progress toward  a greener, more resilient future. All Made by Google products  launched since 2020 are built with  recycled materials.6 On average, Nest thermostats   have proven energy savings of  10%–12% for heating and 15% for  cooling,8 which means they pay   for themselves in under two years.9 By the end of 2020, more than   400 cities worldwide were   using the Environmental Insights  Explorer, a tool that empowers   city planners and policymakers   with actionable data to help   reduce global emissions. Pixel 5 is designed with recycled  aluminum to reduce its carbon  footprint. The aluminum in the  enclosure is 100% recycled content.7 In 2020, we expanded our take-back  program to all 32 countries where  we ship Made by Google products,  allowing customers to responsibly  recycle old and unused devices   for free—whether made by   Google or not. By the end of 2020, Project   Sunroof contained data for more  than 170 million rooftops across  21,500 cities, helping users estimate  the impact and potential savings  from installing solar panels. Maintain or improve average annual fleet-wide   PUE across Google data centers year over year. Maintain ISO 50001 energy management system  certification for Google-owned data centers   that meet certain operational milestones. Achieve Zero Waste to Landfill for our global data  center operations. Replenish 120% of the water we consume, on   average, across our offices and data centers. As a data-driven company, we believe it is critical to regularly track progress  toward our commitments and share updates with our stakeholders. The  following section provides an overview of our 2020 progress toward our  various environmental targets. environmental data table. For a more complete overview of our performance over time, see the 2030 This target was set in 2021. In 2020, the average annual PUE for our global fleet of  data centers was 1.10. Since 2012, our average annual   fleet-wide PUE has stayed at or below 1.12, even as  demand for our products has dramatically risen. In 2020, we maintained our ISO 50001 certification   for our operational European data centers. We   were the first major internet company to achieve a  multi-site energy management system certification   to ISO 50001, which we first attained in 2013. In 2020, our global landfill diversion rate for data  center operations was 81%. Match 100% of the electricity consumption of our  operations with renewable energy purchases. Operate on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030. 2030 In 2020, on an hourly basis, 67% of our data   center electricity use was matched with regional  carbon-free sources. Enable 5 GW of new carbon-free energy in our   key manufacturing regions by 2030. Achieve net-zero emissions across all of our   operations and value chain by 2030. Maintain carbon neutrality for our operations. 2020  (Annual) Compensate for our legacy carbon footprint since   our founding through high-quality carbon credits. Reduce single-occupancy vehicle commuting at   our Bay Area headquarters12 to 45% of workers  commuting on any given day. Provide EV charging stations for 10% of total   parking spaces at our Bay Area headquarters. Pursue the ILFI Living Building Challenge Certification  for our Charleston East and Bay View campuses—  two of Google’s first ground-up development   projects at our Bay Area headquarters. 2030 We’re working toward this target. 2030 This target was set in 2021. 2020 As of September 14, 2020, we had purchased enough  high-quality carbon credits to compensate for our  entire legacy carbon footprint since our founding,  making Google the first major company to be carbon  neutral for its entire operating history. 2023 At our Charleston East campus, we’re working to  achieve the Living Building Challenge Materials Petal  (which includes Red List Free materials and net-zero  waste), and at our Bay View campus, we’re working  to achieve the Living Building Challenge Water Petal  (which includes net-positive water use). In 2020, we purchased enough renewable energy,  from sources such as wind and solar, to match 100%  of the electricity consumption of our data centers  and offices. We were the first company of our size to  reach this milestone back in 2017, and we’ve achieved  it for four consecutive years.11 In 2020, we purchased enough renewable energy   and high-quality carbon credits to compensate for   all our operational GHG emissions. Google has been  carbon neutral since 2007—for 14 consecutive years. We’re working toward this target. Of the total parking spaces at our Bay Area  headquarters, more than 7% were designated   EV parking spaces with charging stations in 2020. Achieve carbon neutrality for 100% of shipments   of Made by Google products to and from Google’s  direct customers by 2020. Publish product environmental reports for 100%   of flagship consumer hardware products launching   in 2020 and beyond. Use recycled or renewable material13 in at least   50% of plastic used across our consumer hardware   product portfolio by 2025.14 Eliminate plastic from packaging and make packaging  100% recyclable by 2025. Include recycled materials in 100% of Made by Google  products launching in 2022 and every year after. Achieve UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification   at all final assembly consumer hardware manufacturing  sites by 2022. Help more than 500 cities and local governments  globally reduce an aggregate of 1 gigaton of   carbon emissions annually by 2030. Help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices  through our core products by 2022. 2020 We met this target early. All shipments of Made by  Google products to and from direct customers   have been carbon neutral since October 2019. 2020 In 2020, we published product environmental reports  for each of our flagship products. 2025 In 2020, we used post-consumer recycled   content across numerous plastic parts in Pixel   and Nest products.15 2025 In 2020, we designed Pixel and Nest packaging to  minimize the use of plastic. The retail packaging for  the Pixel 4a, Pixel 4a (5G), and Pixel 5 use 98% paper  and fiber-based material. 2022 We met this target early. All Made by Google products  launched since 2020 are built with recycled materials.16 2022 In 2020, we achieved certification to the UL 2799 Zero  Waste to Landfill certification standard for several final  assembly manufacturing sites. 2030 In 2020, cities around the world had started using the  Environmental Insights Explorer tool for their climate  action planning efforts. 2022 We’re working toward this target and now offer  multiple new ways that people can use Google  products, such as Google Maps and Google Flights,   to make more sustainable choices.

Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from sources we own or over which we have operational control, such as company vehicles or generators at Google’s offices and data centers. CO2e is a quantity that describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHG, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming potential (GWP), i.e., the ability Since 2010, we’ve procured renewable energy for our operations, and in 2012, we began publishing how this reduces our overall emissions. Until 2015, there was no guidance from the See note 19 above. 24. In 2018, to align with industry best practices for Scope 3 reporting, we extended our reporting boundaries to include emissions associated with food served in our offices, hardware We’ve restated our 2018 Scope 3 (other) emissions due to changes in our calculation methodology and improvements in data quality, resulting in a corresponding restatement of our In 2020, due to the global pandemic, we began to estimate and report on our emissions associated with teleworking (i.e., employees working remotely). We applied the estimation In 2020, we began reporting teleworking emissions as part of our Scope 3 employee commuting emissions. Scope 3 (business travel and employee commuting) emissions reported See note 25 above. 1.  According to Google’s own analysis of our more efficient servers, power infrastructure, and cooling systems, compared with data center industry averages. 2. PUE is a standard industry ratio that compares the amount of non-computing overhead energy (used for things like cooling and power distribution) to the amount of energy used to According to the Uptime Institute’s 2020 Data Center Survey, the global average PUE of respondents’ largest data centers was around 1.59. 4. Carbon credits are reductions in GHG emissions made to compensate for emissions that occur elsewhere. For each metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, one carbon credit We procure high-quality carbon credits to compensate for the carbon emissions from all Google-owned shipments of consumer hardware, including to and from retail partners, Made by Google products are designed with 9%–68% recycled content across their respective plastic parts.

Alphabet’s fiscal year is from January 1 to December 31. 19. GHG emissions are calculated according to The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), developed by the World Resources  Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). For more information on our methodology, including a breakdown of Scope 3 categories,   see Alphabet’s 2021 CDP Climate Change Response. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the production of electricity we purchase to run our operations and the production of space heating for our offices. The location-based  category reflects the average carbon intensity of the electric grids where our operations are located and, thus, where our energy consumption occurs. The market-based category  incorporates our procurement choices, i.e., our renewable energy purchases via contractual mechanisms like PPAs. Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from other sources in our  value chain, such as business travel or our suppliers. of a gas to trap heat in the atmosphere when measured over a specified timescale (generally, 100 years). Some GHGs are more potent than others, as measured by their GWP.   Carbon dioxide is the baseline and thus has a GWP of 1. Greenhouse Gas Protocol on how to account for these emissions reductions, so we developed our own methodology, whereby on an annual basis we assigned renewable electricity  procured against electricity consumed (in megawatt-hours) in the closest data center to the renewable energy project. In 2015, the Greenhouse Gas Protocol released new Scope 2  guidance for the accounting of purchased electricity, steam, heat, and cooling, which we adopted, starting with 2015 data. Our pre-2015 methodology differed from the Greenhouse  Gas Protocol’s in that we did not use residual mixes, which avoid double-counting of claimed renewable energy attributes. manufacturing emissions beyond Tier 1 suppliers (full upstream to the point of extraction), use of sold products, and end-of-life treatment of sold products. Google’s hardware includes  data center servers, networking equipment, and consumer hardware products.

Carbon intensity metrics are based on gross global combined Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions. 37. In 2019, we updated our megawatt-hour carbon intensity metric to include all of our gross Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions divided by our total energy consumption, Total energy consumption includes all fuel and natural gas consumption, purchased electricity, purchased heating, and all electricity generated on-site from renewable and Percentage of renewable energy is calculated on a calendar-year basis, comparing the volume of renewable electricity (in megawatt-hours) procured for our global operations The Greenhouse Gas Protocol’s Scope 2 Guidance requires energy attribute certificates to be sourced from and applied to the same market in which the reporting entity’s electricity- Our carbon-free energy (CFE) percentage measures the degree to which our electricity consumption on a given regional grid is matched with CFE on an hourly basis. This is calculated using We’ve revised total waste generated for 2019 due to a calculation error. This correction resulted in a decrease in total waste generated for 2019 from 51,617 metric tons to 48,216 metric tons. 43. Landfill diversion is calculated as waste diverted to a more sustainable pathway than landfill or incineration without energy recovery. 44. In 2020, pre-consumer food waste prevented in our cafés was tracked only from January to March due to limited café operations during the global pandemic. 45. In 2019, we aligned our water reporting with industry standards to disclose three water indicators: total water withdrawal, as well as consumption and discharge. 46. In 2016, 2017, and 2018, water withdrawal was reported as water consumption. Beginning in 2019, we restated the 2016, 2017, and 2018 values as water withdrawal. 47. 2019 was the first year we disclosed gross global water consumption and gross global water discharge data; data for these indicators is not available for prior years. 48.

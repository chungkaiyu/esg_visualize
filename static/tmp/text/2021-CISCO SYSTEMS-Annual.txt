Fiscal 2021 was a truly transformative year, and one like no  other. Our fiscal year began last July with tremendous global  uncertainty, as the COVID-19 pandemic continued to reshape  how businesses operated, and how all of us lived and worked.  In addition, the racial and social injustices that came to light  shortly before the start of the fiscal year made it clear that we  are all facing a time of incredible change, and throughout the  year, the unfolding reality of climate change created even more  urgency to build a more sustainable economy. Despite the complexity of navigating these  challenges, it has been a year of hope  and optimism as a recovery has started  to take shape. At Cisco, we are incredibly  proud of how our teams have supported  our customers, partners, communities, and  one another through this time, giving us all  a renewed sense of purpose. This past year has also made it undeniably  clear that a focused, agile, and resilient  business, guided by its purpose and  values, and anchored in its strategy,  can emerge stronger and better from  challenging times. While the world looks  and feels different today, Cisco’s core  purpose to power an inclusive future  for all continues to guide us as we  look forward to enabling a reimagined  future with tremendous opportunity ahead. Building momentum While fiscal 2021 certainly carried  uncertainties, we ended it with exceptional  momentum and positive revenue growth.  We believe that our performance  demonstrates strong execution against our  strategy, robust customer adoption, trust in  our innovative solutions, and accelerating  adoption of our software and subscription  offerings. In the fourth quarter, we  experienced the strongest product order  year-over-year growth rate in over a  decade, driven in part by our customers’  urgency to modernize their infrastructure,  digitize their businesses, and adapt to the  future of work. As we continue the successful  transformation of our business model that  we have been investing in and executing  on to drive higher subscription revenue,  we have seen more predictability in our  business model and greater visibility into our  future. Our solid performance, combined  with the strength of our transformation, only  reinforces my confidence about our future. In fiscal 2021, our software revenue was  $15 billion of our total revenue of $49.8  billion, up 7% year over year, making us  one of the largest software companies  in the world. We also achieved software  subscription revenue growth of 15% year  over year. We believe our investments  are paying off, as our offerings delivered  a strong recurring stream of revenues  and are one of the key reasons why  we finished the year with strong  remaining performance obligations.  Our consistent performance allowed us to  close out the year with a strong balance  sheet and solid cash flows, enabling us to  continue to invest in our growth. However, we are also seeing similar  supply issues for key components that  nearly every company in the industry is  experiencing. We believe our world-class  supply chain team will help us navigate this  complex situation, enable us to optimize  our access to key components (including  semiconductors), and help us to take care  of our customers by fulfilling demand as  quickly as possible. Power of our portfolio—   Leading with innovation As businesses slowly reopen, we see  a tremendous opportunity ahead as  nearly every company in every industry  accelerates its digital agility in a cloud- first world. Our customers are looking for  solutions that provide speed, agility, and  simplicity, and Cisco is the right company  to deliver on each of these areas with our  continued innovation. We believe that we are at a pivotal moment  as we have a massive opportunity to  transform what has been the traditional  office and define the future of hybrid work.  As our customers look to create safer hybrid  workplaces and collaborative, engaging  experiences for their customers and employees, we believe they are becoming  increasingly reliant on Cisco technologies to  help them achieve those goals. Over the last fiscal year, we have  introduced a number of new capabilities  across our entire portfolio, while also  investing in more flexible consumption  models including our core networking  capabilities as a service, highlighted by the  recent launch of Cisco Plus. Our new Cisco Plus solutions will deliver  cross-portfolio technologies to help solve  our customers’ biggest needs with faster  time to value. Our initial “network-as-a- service” offering delivers hybrid cloud  technologies and will later expand to  a broader catalog of services built and  delivered with our partner ecosystem.  While still in the early days of its launch,  Cisco Plus directly aligns with our  transformation goals around driving more  subscription-based revenue. providing our customers  the technologies they  need to successfully  navigate highly dynamic  environments at an  incredibly rapid pace, and  we’re continuing to see  strong customer reception  for our accelerated  investments in software  and subscriptions. In collaboration, we continue to invest in and  accelerate Webex, through both acquisitions  and delivering new innovations, including the  introduction of more than 1,000 new features  and devices since last year. These innovations  include the all-new Webex Suite, with a  new look and feel that support hybrid work  collaboration. We acquired several software-based  companies within the collaboration space,  including Slido and Socio Labs, which we  are integrating into our Webex platform to  provide a comprehensive event management  solution. We also acquired IMImobile, a  cloud communications software and services  company, and Involvio, a leading student  experience platform. In security, we are focused on proactively  protecting our customers from threats and  remediating against them in an ever-increasing  cyberthreat environment. We are increasingly  deploying our zero-trust and secure access  service edge (SASE) architectures, along  with automation, authentication, and analytics  capabilities. Additionally, we have delivered  several new innovations, including passwordless  authentication, cloud-based malware detection,  and enhancements to SecureX. To complement  these innovations, we acquired assets like  Kenna Security, to drive even greater security  efficacy. The broad and accelerating adoption of  multicloud and modern application environments  is changing how the world’s largest networks  are built, operated, and secured, and we believe  Cisco is at the center of this transition. We are  building the internet for the future by creating  breakthrough innovation with our routing,  optical, and automation technologies to deliver  significant economic benefits. We launched  a new routed optical networking solution  integrating our scalable, high-performance  routers and Acacia’s pluggable optics, which  offers significant cost savings. We are also  significantly expanding our footprint with our  webscale customers as they begin their 400G  upgrade cycles. Going forward, we will continue to increase our  investments in key growth areas and technology  shifts to help our customers succeed. Our  focus areas will include hybrid cloud, hybrid  work, 5G, Wi-Fi 6, edge, security, and cloud- native architectures. I firmly believe increased  investments in these areas will extend our  technology leadership position and help our  customers identify solutions that drive speed,  agility, and simplicity. difference in communities across the world,  Cisco remains committed to our purpose: to  power an inclusive future for all. One key focus area is our commitment to  creating sustainable solutions to address  environmental issues that face communities  around the world. For example, we’ve taken  several actions to protect the planet and  address the global climate change crisis. In  September, we announced our commitments  to be net zero across all scopes of greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, which includes  our product use, operations, and supply chain,  and net zero across all global Scope 1 and  Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2025. We have  already achieved 100% renewable energy in the  U.S. and in many countries across Europe and  will continue to take additional steps to reduce  our carbon footprint going forward. In addition,  in April, the Cisco Foundation committed  $100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit  grants and impact investing in climate solutions. We also continue to remain focused on  the critical need to address racial equality  and social justice. This past May, we  announced our commitment to invest  $150 million in historically black colleges  and universities by providing networking,  security, and collaboration technologies, as  well as IT support services, to address their  cybersecurity and digital infrastructure needs. Confidence in our future As we look to fiscal 2022, we are excited to  build on our strong momentum from this past  fiscal year, with continued focus on growth,  execution, and innovation. As the global  recovery takes shape, we are executing on our  vision of rebuilding a better world—one that is  digital, sustainable, inclusive, and highly secure. We are committed to providing our customers  the technologies they need to successfully  navigate highly dynamic environments at an  incredibly rapid pace, and we’re continuing  to see strong customer appreciation of our  accelerated investments in software and  subscriptions. I’m more confident than ever  in our position as the worldwide leader in  technology that powers the internet, the digital  enterprise, and the future of work, and I’m  excited for the opportunities ahead. Thank you for your continued support, and we  hope you stay healthy and safe. Achieved over 53% of  subscription revenue  from software and  services in FY21.

Cisco Systems, Inc. S&P 500 Index Scott Herren EVP and Chief Financial Officer We delivered a solid  fiscal year with strong  operational execution  and growth in our  portfolio of software  and services. Software  subscriptions were  79% of our software  revenue and we now  have over $30 billion in  remaining performance  obligations. Our results  reflect the returns on  the investments we’re  making in innovation  and a continued shift  to more software and  subscriptions, driving  more recurring revenue  delivering growth and  shareholder value. As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises,  and as more applications move to a multicloud environment, the  network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating  change at an unprecedented pace. Our mission is to shape the  future of the internet by inspiring new possibilities for them by helping  transform their infrastructure, expand applications and analytics,  address their security needs, and empower their teams. We believe that our customers are  looking for outcomes that are data- driven and provide meaningful business  value through automation, security,  and analytics across private, hybrid,  and multicloud environments. We are  focusing on four customer priorities:  Reimagine Applications, Power Hybrid  Work, Transform Infrastructure, and  Secure the Enterprise. We are also  accelerating our efforts to enable the  delivery of network functionality as a  service, as our customers increasingly  want to consume our technologies in  flexible ways. We have made the initial  step with our new as-a-service portfolio,  Cisco Plus, and our first offer, Cisco Plus  hybrid cloud, which combines our data Build networking solutions  with built-in simplicity,  security, agility, and  automation that can be  consumed as-a-service.

Cisco Plus includes our plans  to deliver networking as a service, which  is designed to unify networking, security,  and observability across access, wide  area network (WAN), and cloud domains. Our strategy is to help our customers  connect, secure, and automate in order  to accelerate their digital agility in a  cloud-first world. To execute on our  strategy and address our customer  priorities, we are focusing on the  following six strategic pillars: Secure,  Agile Networks; Hybrid Work; Optimized  Application Experiences; End-to-End  Security; Internet for the Future; and  Capabilities at the Edge. Enable greater speed, agility,  and scale of cloud-native  applications. Develop new capabilities for a  distributed world while enhancing  the developer experience  and extending enterprise and  carrier networks. Scott Herren EVP and Chief  Financial Officer At Cisco, diversity, inclusion,  and collaboration are  fundamental to who we are,  how we create the best teams,  and how we drive success. A  diverse workplace creates a  vibrant culture where everyone  is welcomed, respected,  valued, and heard. Cisco has signed the  CEO Action for Diversity  and Inclusion™ Pledge.  We are delivering on this  pledge by accelerating  full-spectrum diversity— including gender, age, race,  ethnicity, orientation, ability,  nationality, religion, veteran  status, background, culture,  experience, strengths, and  perspectives. It starts at  the top in that 46% of our  executive leadership team  (ELT) are women and 54%  are diverse in terms of gender  or ethnicity, making Cisco an  industry leader in ELT diversity. Learn more about Cisco’s  executive leadership team at   https://newsroom.cisco. com/ exec-bios. Cisco is committed to stockholder-friendly corporate governance, and the Board of Directors has  adopted clear corporate policies that promote excellence in corporate governance. At Cisco, we recognize the importance of  regular and transparent communication  with our stockholders. Each year, we  continually engage with a significant  portion of stockholders that include our  top institutional investors. In fiscal 2021, our Chair of the Board and  Chief Executive Officer, Secretary, and  Investor Relations team held meetings,  conference calls and/or corresponded  with investors representing approximately  27% of our outstanding shares, including  65% of our top 30 stockholders. We engaged with these stockholders on a  variety of topics, including our business and  long-term strategy, corporate governance  and risk management practices, board  leadership and refreshment, diversity,  corporate social responsibility initiatives  (including environmental, social,  and governance matters), executive  compensation program, and other matters  of stockholder interest. Consistent with feedback we received  from stockholders, for fiscal 2021, we  considered each executive’s progress  toward Cisco’s ESG-related initiatives in  the individual performance factors (IPF) in  our Executive Incentive Plan, namely our  executives’ progress during the COVID-19  pandemic in promoting Cisco’s Conscious  Culture, an inclusive, safe, and healthy  work environment in which our employees  can thrive. We believe that risk is inherent in  innovation and the pursuit of long- term growth opportunities. Cisco’s  management is responsible for day- to-day risk management activities.  The Board of Directors, acting  directly and through its committees,  is responsible for the oversight of  Cisco’s risk management. With the  oversight of the Board of Directors,  Cisco has implemented practices,  processes, and programs designed  to help manage the risks to which we  are exposed in our business and to  align risk-taking with our efforts to  increase stockholder value. We have adopted these policies and   practices consistent with our  commitment to transparency and best-  in-class practices, as well as to ensure   compliance with the rules and  regulations of the SEC, the listing  requirements of Nasdaq, and applicable  corporate governance requirements. The Board of Directors regularly  discusses many core subjects with  executive management, including  strategy, operations, information  systems, finance, and legal and public  policy matters, in which risk oversight is  an inherent element. The Audit Committee, which oversees  financial and risk management policies,  including data protection (comprising both  privacy and security), receives regular  reports on enterprise risk management  (ERM) from the chair of the ERM operating  committee and regular reports on  cybersecurity from Cisco’s Chief Security  and Trust Officer multiple times a year. Cisco’s management has implemented  an ERM program, managed by Cisco’s  internal audit function, that is designed  to work across the business to identify,  assess, govern, and manage risks and  Cisco’s response to those risks. Cisco’s internal audit function performs  an annual risk assessment that is used  by the ERM program. The structure of  the ERM program includes both an ERM  operating committee that focuses on  risk management-related topics and an  ERM executive committee consisting of  members of executive management. The ERM operating committee conducts  global risk reviews and provides regular  updates to the ERM executive committee. Other board committees oversee specific  categories of risk associated with their  respective areas of responsibility. These charts summarize the major  elements of target total direct  compensation for our CEO and our  other named executive officers  (NEOs1) as a group for fiscal 2021 and  demonstrate our continued pay-for- performance philosophy. Our pay practices align with our  pay-for-performance philosophy  and underscore our commitment to  sound compensation and governance  practices. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Cisco’s Board of Directors believes strongly in the value of an independent board of directors. Independent board  members have consistently comprised over 75% of the members of Cisco’s Board of Directors. All members of the  key board committees—the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Management Development Committee, and the  Nomination and Governance Committee—are independent.

Robbins 55 One of the Board’s key responsibilities is overseeing management’s formulation and execution of Cisco’s strategy. Throughout the  year, our CEO, the executive leadership team, and other leaders from across the company provide detailed business and strategy  updates to the Board. During these reviews, the Board engages with the executive leadership team and other business leaders  regarding various topics, including business strategy and initiatives, capital allocation, portfolio updates, the competitive landscape,  talent and culture including inclusion and diversity, ESG concerns including human rights implications of Cisco product development  and sales, our environmental impact, and regulatory developments. Additionally, on an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves  Cisco’s financial plan. The Lead Independent Director also chairs regularly scheduled executive sessions of the independent directors,  without Cisco management present, during which Cisco’s strategy is reviewed and other topics are discussed. Cisco Corporate Affairs leads our social  investment programs and champions our  commitment to CSR performance and  transparency. This team engages with  internal and external stakeholders, leads our  ESG materiality assessment,1 and stewards  CSR reporting activities, which are aligned  with standards set by the Global Reporting  Initiative (GRI). Additionally, to improve ease  of use and comparability with peers, Cisco  plans to index its 2021 Purpose Report  against frameworks from GRI, the Value  Reporting Foundation (SASB Standards),  the Task Force on Climate-related Financial  Disclosures, and the UN Sustainable  Development Goals, where applicable. The  Corporate Affairs team also works cross- functionally to help determine CSR priorities  and drives the process for CSR governance  across business functions. The Nomination  and Governance Committee of the Board  reviews Cisco’s policies and programs  concerning corporate social responsibility,  including ESG matters. This structure is  designed to ensure that we prioritize the  right ESG issues as a company, and that we  stay on track with our commitments. Technology has the potential to create  opportunities—or deepen inequalities.  Cisco believes that technology, when  thoughtfully and strategically applied, can  help address inequities; bring positive,  lasting change to people’s lives and  communities; and benefit the planet. We  have a purpose to Power an Inclusive  Future for All. We announced this purpose  in 2020 and developed a framework for  how we can fulfill this purpose through  our technology, actions, and intentions.  Throughout our upcoming fiscal 2021  Purpose Report, which is expected to  be published in December 2021, we  share how Cisco has helped to bring  this purpose to life. Our corporate social  responsibility (CSR) reporting describes  our commitments, goals, progress, and  impact for the environmental, social,  and governance (ESG) topics that are  significant to Cisco and our stakeholders. 1  ESG materiality, as used in this report, and our ESG materiality assessment process is different than when  * These CSR focus areas are the topics identified in our FY21 ESG materiality assessment.1 used in the context of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure obligations. Issues deemed  material for purposes of this report and for purposes of determining our ESG strategy may not be considered  material for SEC reporting purposes, nor does inclusion of information in this report indicate that the topic or  information is material to Cisco’s financial condition or results of operations. Reviews Cisco’s  policies and programs  concerning corporate  social responsibility,  including environmental,  social, and  governance matters. Cisco’s efforts to deliver on our stated purpose to Power  an Inclusive Future for All are organized into several ESG  topics. From the technology that helps securely power the  world’s connectivity (Power), to driving fairness, inclusion,  and equitable opportunity (Inclusive), and helping to  ensure a sustainable and regenerative planet (Future). Over 85% of the world’s web  traffic travels securely across  Cisco connections. Our software  and solutions protect the data of  millions of users within public sector  organizations and businesses  of all sizes, including 98% of the  Fortune 500. At Cisco, we hold ourselves  to the highest standards of  business conduct. This requires  applying leading security and  privacy practices and global  principles of human rights to the  design, sourcing, manufacturing,  and sale of our solutions and  working to integrate a human  rights perspective across Cisco’s  glo�al �usiness.�Cisco earns  trust by striving to operate  with transparency, fairness,  accountability, and integrity in  every aspect of our business.  The pandemic has intensified the  importance of all these issues.  Digital, cloud-first, and remote/ hybrid work are now the default for  many organizations, and advanced  networks are essential for business  resiliency and reliability. Earning and upholding stakeholder  trust goes beyond the integrity  of solutions and networks. It  also speaks to our financial  transparency and high standards  of ethical conduct. Cisco has  forged trusted relationships among  global stakeholders. Cisco works to ensure that our  products are made responsibly,  consistent with Cisco’s values. We  expect our manufacturing partners  and suppliers to uphold Cisco’s  standards for labor, health and  safety, environment, and ethics.  We are a founding member of the  Responsible Business Alliance  (RBA) and have long adopted We power inclusivity through our  Conscious Culture and social  impact initiatives. Our Conscious  Culture informs all aspects of the  Cisco employee experience—from  how we support employees across  the full spectrum of diversity to  how we engage teams and give  back to communities. It is a set  of expectations, principles, and  measures that we believe best  define Cisco’s values, beliefs, and  ethos. Our values and expectations  are laid out in our Code of Business  Conduct. Every employee must  certify compliance with the code  each year to help ensure integrity in  the workplace and the ethical use  of data and resources, and to help  prevent conflicts of interest. Living a  Conscious Culture requires us to act  with dignity, respect, fairness, and  equity in each of our interactions  with one another, building a culture  that allows us to become a catalyst  for social change. the RBA Code of Conduct as our  Supplier Code of Conduct. We  maintain high expectations of  our global network of suppliers,  engaging closely with them to  protect human rights, promote  health and well-being, and extend  economic opportunity. We assess  our suppliers’ conformance  to our policies through risk  assessments, audits, and targeted  engage�ents.�If suppliers do not  meet our standards, we work  with them to improve and hold  them accountable to achieve  that i�prove�ent.��e also  implement targeted initiatives to  address identified areas of risk or  opportunities to deliver benefit.  This work in our supply chain is a  core element of our commitment to  corporate social responsibility. ● At Cisco, it starts at the top: 46% of our ELT  are women and 54% are diverse in terms  of gender or ethnicity. With respect to our  Board of Directors,  36% are women, 64%  are men, 9% are Asian, 9% are African  American or Black, and Native American,  82% are White, and 18% are diverse in terms  of sexual orientation. ● Based on our annual fiscal 2020 data, our  global employee base was comprised  of 27% women and 73% men, and our  U.S. employee base was comprised of  the following ethnicities: 51.8% White/ Caucasian, 36.5% Asian, 5.8% Hispanic/ Latinx, 4.1% African American/Black, 1.4%  two or more races (not Hispanic or Latinx),  and 0.4% additional groups (including  American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native  Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander). ● Cisco has signed the CEO Action for  Diversity and Inclusion Pledge. ● We announced our Social Justice Beliefs,  which includes a set of actions including  our response to systemic racism and a  commitment to be antiracist in all forms. ● We continued to offer employees “A Day for  Me,” which were paid days off that allowed  for each individual to recharge and rest. ● Approximately 2 million Team Space  Check-Ins by our employees in fiscal 2021,  reflecting 85% of employees submitting  Team Space Check-Ins. For more  information see our  CSR website at  csr.cisco.com. When people are respected for who they are  and encouraged to seek balance between  work and personal life, we believe they are  more productive and successful in their jobs  and able to give their best to their families  and communities. In fiscal 2017, we set a  goal to achieve 80% employee participation  in community impact by 2020. We achieved  that goal last year and sustained it through  fiscal 2021. We were honored to be ranked  number 1 on the Great Place to Work® list of  the World’s Best Workplaces in 2020, with  93% of employees surveyed saying Cisco is  a great place to work. This year, we continued our momentum and  growth in the diversity of our workforce. We  have continued to make significant gains  in diverse talent even while we continue to  navigate the challenges and impacts of the  pandemic. Of special note is the accelerated  progress Cisco is making in attracting  African American/Black talent at both the  non-executive and Director/VP levels. Since we announced our Social Justice  Beliefs in September 2020, we have  launched 12 subsequent actions in support  of and solidarity with the Black community.  Our Social Justice Beliefs provide a blueprint  for how we respond to injustice and address  inequity, not just now, but in the future, when  we see injustice and systemic inequality  happening for any community across the  full spectrum of diversity. This year, we  launched the Inclusive Future Action Office  to accelerate Cisco’s priorities in this area.  Our Inclusive Future Action Office will help  us be relentless in our progress and will  support teams in expanding their impact. Cisco has always been committed to  compensating our employees fairly and  equitably. We are a founding signer of the  White House Equal Pay Pledge and the  Parity.org pledge, and we are leading the  charge to make fair pay a reality for all  employees through the Employers for Pay  Equity Consortium. We have also introduced  an innovative and inclusive framework that  provides us powerful analytics to evaluate  our complex compensation system. For  example, by using these powerful analytics,  we are able to test for pay parity on a  regular basis, and when gaps are found, we  strive to correct them. At its core, to Power an Inclusive Future  for All means helping the underserved  and most vulnerable. Cisco believes that  technology can be used to help solve  our greatest social challenges, such as  addressing critical human needs and  disaster relief, economic inequality, digital inclusion, and education, including training  in digital skills. Cisco set a goal in 2016  to positively impact one billion people by  2025 through our social impact grants and  signature CSR programs.2 We cannot create  this future on our own, so we engage with  nonprofit partners to invest in early-stage  solutions and form long-term partnerships  that allow organizations to put technology to  its highest and best use. Cisco has a proud legacy of leading the  private sector in responding to humanitarian  challenges. In fiscal 2021, we merged  two existing functions within Cisco—the  Critical Human Needs portfolio team and  the Tactical Operations (TacOps) team—to  form Cisco Crisis Response �CC��.�CC�  brings together our Critical Human Needs  investment portfolio, which provides  cash and product grants to organizations  responding to humanitarian crises and  natural disasters, with our Cisco TacOps  team, which, since 2005, has responded  to more than 60 worldwide incidents, from  natural disasters to forced mass migration,  providing free crisis communication  networks to support recovery. We are also teaching IT skills to millions  of students every year through the Cisco  Networking Academy. In fiscal 2021,  three million people participated in Cisco  Networking Academy courses in 180  countries, bringing the total to 15 million  students since inception. We also  expanded the Cisco Networking Academy  by launching Skills for All, a mobile-first  platform offering learners a personalized  pathway to entry-level technology jobs. In early fiscal 2022, we committed to  reach net zero for greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions across all scopes by 2040,  10 years ahead of when climate scientists  say the planet must reach net zero to  avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Environmental sustainability is foundational  to creating a more inclusive world. Since  2006, Cisco has been driving meaningful  change by reducing emissions associated  with our operations, product use, and  supply chain. We are also helping to ensure  sustainable use of resources by continuing  to apply circular economy principles to  the entire lifecycle of our products, and by  being responsible stewards of the natural  resources we all share, like water and air. funding from other organizations. Recently  Cisco completed an external limited  assurance review of our progress toward  this goal. For more information see the  criteria document and assurance report  available at csr.cisco.com. Cisco has been setting and achieving  emissions reduction goals since 2006  and is currently working toward targets  to reduce emissions from our operations,  products, and supply chain. Our fiscal  2022 targets covering Scope 1 and 2  emissions are approved by the Science  Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and are  consistent with reductions required  to keep global warming to well below  2°C. We met these targets one year  early and will now turn our attention to  our 2025 Scope 1 and 2 targets. Measuring and managing environmental  performance extends to Cisco’s  global supply chain operations. Active  engagement with suppliers is helping us  make progress toward our goals to have  suppliers set their own absolute GHG  emissions reduction targets and reduce  Cisco’s absolute supply chain-related  Scope 3 GHG emissions. The largest portion of Cisco’s carbon  footprint is from the operation of our  products by our customers. Cisco has  set a goal to improve large rack-mounted  equipment system power efficiency by  77% to 87% by fiscal 2022 (fiscal 2016  baseline). This improvement will help  reduce our customers’ operating expense  and Cisco’s carbon footprint. As we have  done over the course of many years, we  will continue to invest in key engineering  initiatives to help drive progress in this area. Additionally, Cisco is helping innovators  and communities around the world explore  solutions and respond to the consequences  of a changing climate. In April 2021, the  Cisco Foundation announced a 10-year,  $100 million commitment to fund nonprofit  grants and impact investing in climate  solutions. This new funding portfolio will  support strong initiatives to spur community  engagement and innovative solutions that Cisco’s net zero goal will be supported by  near-term targets, including to reach net  zero for all global Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions by 2025. are designed to draw down the carbon  already in the atmosphere or regenerate  depleted ecosystems. Also in fiscal 2021,  we offered the first ever Greenhouse  Gas Solutions Prize in our annual Cisco  Global Problem Solver Challenge.  Through this program, Cisco awards  cash prizes to early-stage startups using  technology to address environmental and  social challenges. Making the world a better place with  technology begins with how that  technology is designed, made, used, and  reused. For decades, the global economy  has been based on a “take-make-dispose”  model, where products are manufactured  from virgin materials, purchased, and  then discarded. This linear model is not  sustainable. It depletes scarce natural  resources, creates too much waste, and  produces carbon emissions that contribute  to climate change. Cisco has been working and continues  to work to integrate circular economy  principles across our business. In addition  to making our products more energy  efficient, we are designing them to  reduce the environmental impacts of their  manufacture and to better facilitate repair  and remanufacturing—with the goal to  maximize reuse of products and materials.  We continue to make progress on our  Platform for Accelerating the Circular  Economy (PACE) Capital Equipment  Pledge, signed by CEO Chuck Robbins in  2018, committing to 100% product return  upon request, at no cost to our customers.  This builds on almost two decades of  programs to facilitate product returns for  reuse and recycling, offer comprehensive  service and repair, and remanufacture  used equipment for sale through Cisco  Refresh. We continue to work to improve  the customer experience to drive  increased product returns at end of use,  and expand business and as-a-service  models to facilitate return and reuse. Cisco’s technology and solutions also  enable customers to derive value from  a circular model and achieve their own  environmental sustainability goals.  The physical mechanics of the circular  economy—for example, remanufacturing  and recirculating products or improving  infrastructure in cities to minimize  resource use and waste—are enabled  by digital technology. Collaborating with  our customers and other stakeholders is  essential to achieving a circular economy. At Cisco, we believe that by offering an attractive value proposition to customers and partners, by  creating diverse and inclusive workplaces and a conscious culture for employees, and by engaging  regularly with stockholders and communities, we can create and maximize long-term value.

Business  General Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that power the Internet. We are integrating our platforms across networking,  security, collaboration, applications and the cloud. These platforms are designed to help our customers manage more users,  devices and things connecting to their networks. This will enable us to provide customers with a highly secure, intelligent  platform for their digital business. We conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into the following three  geographic segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and China (APJC). Our products and technologies are grouped into the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms; Applications; Security and  Other Products. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service offerings, including technical support  services and advanced services. Increasingly, we are delivering our technologies through software and services. Our customers  include businesses of all sizes, public institutions, governments, and service providers, including large webscale providers.  These customers often look to us as a strategic partner to help them use information technology (IT) to differentiate themselves  and drive positive business outcomes. At our annual meeting of shareholders held on December 10, 2020, shareholders voted to approve changing our state of  incorporation from California to Delaware. The reincorporation became effective on January 25, 2021. Our headquarters are in  San Jose, California. The mailing address of our headquarters is 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134-1706, and  our telephone number at that location is (408) 526-4000. Our website is www.cisco.com. Through a link on the Investor Relations  section of our website, we make available the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed  with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at sec.gov: our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly  Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports or other information filed or  furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. All such filings are available free of charge. The information  published on our website, or any other website referenced herein, is not incorporated into this report. As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud environment,  the network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace and our mission is  to shape the future of the Internet by inspiring new possibilities for them by helping transform their infrastructure, expand  applications and analytics, address their security needs, and empower their teams. We believe that our customers are looking for  outcomes that are data-driven and provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics across private,  hybrid, and multicloud environments. We are focusing on four customer priorities: Reimagine Applications, Power of Hybrid Work, Transforming Infrastructure and  Secure the Enterprise. In our view, over the next several years, customers will be increasingly writing modern software applications that can run on  any hybrid cloud, and will be adding billions of connections to their environments. Customers will need to be able to build  applications quickly, deploy them nearly anywhere, monitor experiences, and act in real time. We believe we are uniquely positioned to enable successful business outcomes for customers in hybrid and multicloud  environments. In our view, networks are increasingly critical to business success and we believe our customers will benefit  from the insights and intelligence that we are making accessible through our highly differentiated platforms. We are continuing our commitment to deliver full stack observability from the application to the infrastructure to give our  customers greater insights that enable faster, better decision making. We are doing this through adding key elements to our  portfolio, such as: infrastructure optimization with Intersight, network monitoring with technology from our acquisition of  ThousandEyes, application performance monitoring with AppDynamics, as well as our security innovations. Our customers’ communications continue to evolve as we move to a digital, cloud-based world. As our customers’ people are an  important competitive advantage to them, their teams need effective and simple ways to work better together and to interact with  their customers to build better relationships and increase collaboration. As an example, we believe our collaboration portfolio,  which includes our subscription-based Webex conferencing platform, is at the center of our customers’ strategy for enabling  their teams to be more productive and secure. With the future of work being hybrid, we are focused on delivering highly secure collaboration experiences regardless of  whether workers are physically at home or in the office. During fiscal 2021, we have added a significant number of new features,  including digital signage, touchless calls, room capacity alerts, and environmental sensors to help enable a safer return to the  office. We also extended our Webex suite of devices through our new desk camera and desk hub solutions. In an increasingly digital and connected world, our customers are looking to modernize and transform their infrastructure.  Our strategy began with Software-Defined Access (SD-Access) technology, one of our leading enterprise architectures and  continued with the launch of our Catalyst 9000 series of switches. Since the initial launch, we have continued to transform our enterprise access portfolio by bringing together several technologies  to form the only integrated architecture with built-in simplicity, automation and security at the foundation. This architecture  is designed to enable our customers to securely connect their users and devices to applications and data over any network, to  applications and data, no matter where they are. We have introduced several innovations that extend our networking capabilities to wireless and enterprise routing products,  including Software-Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) edge platforms. Our SD-WAN  solutions are designed to provide direct branch to cloud connectivity, enabling the workforce to access their software-as-a-  service (SaaS) applications and workloads in an optimized and highly secure manner. We have continued to expand our  SD-WAN offering, through our Cloud OnRamp integrations with several webscale providers to deliver predictable and highly  secure application experiences. To further our innovation in this area, we are applying the latest technologies, such as machine learning and advanced analytics,  to operate and enhance network capabilities. These network product offerings are designed to enable customers to detect  cybersecurity threats, even in encrypted traffic. As such, we have created, in our view, the only network that is designed for  security while maintaining privacy. Our customers are operating in multicloud environments with private, public and hybrid clouds. For the data center, our strategy  is to deliver multicloud architectures that bring policy and operational consistency, regardless of where applications or data  reside, by extending our Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) and our hyperconverged offerings. In fiscal 2020, we announced details of our technology strategy for the Internet for the Future aimed at addressing the broad  adoption of multicloud and application environments. We continue to make significant investments in the development of  software, silicon and optics — which we believe are the building blocks for the Internet for the Future. We introduced Cisco Silicon One, a single unified silicon architecture, as well as the Cisco 8000 carrier-class router family  built on Cisco Silicon One and our operating system, Cisco IOS XR7. We have also expanded our Cisco Silicon One platform  from a routing focused solution to one which addresses the webscale switching market. We also launched a new routed optical  networking solution integrating our routers and pluggable optics from our recent acquisition of Acacia, which further helps to  deliver cost savings to our customers. With the rapid growth in modern applications, more distributed work environments, and increasing cyber-attacks, we believe  every organization requires new or enhanced security architectures. Our security strategy is focused on delivering a simple  and effective cyber-security architecture combining network, cloud and endpoint-based solutions that recognizes the critical  importance of data privacy. Our comprehensive security portfolio offers simplified protection for any workload on any cloud while minimizing the attack surface  and automating security policies across an organization’s hybrid cloud footprint. This extends to our secure access service edge  (SASE) framework and Zero Trust architecture, where we have developed a cloud-delivered stack across Umbrella, a secure Internet  gateway, Meraki, SD-WAN, and Viptela. We are also delivering unified detection and response capabilities built on Cisco SecureX,  our new cloud-native platform, which is a built-in platform that connects our Cisco Secure portfolio and our customers’ infrastructure. Our strategy is to help our customers connect, secure, and automate in order to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first  world. To execute on our strategy and address our customer priorities, we are focusing on the following six strategic pillars: We are also accelerating our efforts to enable the delivery of network functionality as a service as our customers increasingly  want to consume our technologies in flexible ways. We have made the initial step with our new as-a-service portfolio, Cisco Plus,  and our first offer, Cisco Plus hybrid cloud, which combines our data center compute, networking and storage portfolio. Cisco  Plus includes our plans to deliver networking-as-a-service, which is designed to unify networking, security and observability  across access, wide area network (WAN), and cloud domains. We are transforming our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Historically, our various networking technology  products have aligned with their respective product categories. However, increasingly our offerings are crossing multiple product  categories. As our core networking offerings evolve, we expect we will add more common software features across our core  networking platforms. We are increasing the amount of software offerings that we provide and the proportion of subscription  software offerings. We have various software offerings that fall into the broad categories of subscription arrangements, including  SaaS and term licenses, and perpetual licenses. As part of the transformation of our business, we continued to make strides during fiscal 2021 to develop and sell more software and  subscription-based offerings. We are also focused on the entire customer lifecycle to drive expansion and renewals. We will continue  to invest in network-as-a-service offerings to provide our customers with flexibility in how they want to utilize our technologies. For a discussion of the risks associated with our strategy, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We depend  upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict  and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.”  For information regarding sales of our major products and services, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. •  Secure, Agile Networks — Build networking solutions with built-in simplicity, security, agility and automation that  can be consumed as-a-service. •  Optimized Application Experiences — Enabling greater speed, agility and scale of cloud-native applications. •  Hybrid Work — Deliver highly secure access, a safer workplace and collaboration experiences for the hybrid workforce. •  Internet for the Future — Transform connectivity by efficiently meeting the ever-growing demand for low-latency  and higher speeds. •  End-to-End Security — Build simple, integrated, and high efficacy end-to-end security solutions, delivered on- premise or in the cloud. •  Capabilities at the Edge — Develop new capabilities for a distributed world while enhancing the developer experience  and extending enterprise and carrier networks.

We are focused on three priorities:  utilizing technology advisory services to drive higher product and services; assessment and migration services providing the  tools, expertise and methodologies to enable our customers to migrate to new technology platforms; and providing optimization  services aligned with customers’ business expectations. Many factors influence the IT, collaboration, and networking requirements of our customers. These include the size of the  organization, number and types of technology systems, geographic location, and business applications deployed throughout the  customer’s network. Our customer base is not limited to any specific industry, geography, or market segment. In each of the past  three fiscal years, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue. Our customers primarily operate in the following  markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector. Enterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices and typically  employ 1,000 or more employees. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a  multivendor environment. We offer service and support packages, financing, and managed network services, primarily through  our service provider partners. We sell these products through a network of third-party application and technology vendors and  channel partners, as well as selling directly to these customers. Within the commercial market, we define large businesses as organizations which typically have fewer than 1,000 employees.  We sell to the larger, or midmarket, customers within the commercial market through a combination of our direct sales force  and channel partners. These customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand,  but with less complexity. Small businesses, or organizations with fewer than 100 employees, require information technologies  and communications products that are easy to configure, install, and maintain. We sell to these smaller organizations within the  commercial market primarily through channel partners. Service providers offer data, voice, video, and mobile/wireless services to businesses, governments, utilities, and consumers  worldwide. The service provider market includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers, webscale operators  as well as Internet, cable, and wireless providers. We also include media, broadcast, and content providers within our service  provider market, as the lines in the telecommunications industry continue to blur between traditional network-based, content-  based and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks.  In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or  Internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require  network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose  requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach. The public sector market includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public  sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector  customers through a network of third-party application and technology vendors, channel partners, as well as through direct sales. As of the end of fiscal 2021, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 25,000 employees, including  managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We have field sales offices in approximately 90 countries, and  we sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial  portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Channel  partners include systems integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical  support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also  typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators. Distributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through  distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a  sell-in method. These distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory, receive  credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. For information regarding risks related to our sales channels, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled  “Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins” and “Inventory management relating to  our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.” For information regarding risks relating to our international operations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors  entitled “Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain  geopolitical environment;” “Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely  increase demands on our service and support operations;” “Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic  changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition;” “We are  exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows;” and  “Cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition,  and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber-attacks or data breaches on our customers’  networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our  reputation or otherwise materially harm our business,” among others. Our service offerings complement our products through a range of consulting, technical, project, quality, and software  maintenance services, including 24-hour online and telephone support through technical assistance centers. We provide financing arrangements for certain qualified customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. We believe  customer financing is a competitive advantage in obtaining business, particularly for those customers involved in significant  infrastructure projects. Our financing arrangements include the following: The markets in which we compete require a wide variety of technologies, products, and capabilities. Our growth strategy is  based on the components of innovation, which we sometimes refer to as “build, buy, partner, invest, and co-develop.” This five-  prong approach to how we innovate can be summarized as follows: We have acquired many companies, and we expect to make future acquisitions. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology  companies are inherently risky, especially if the acquired company has yet to generate revenue. No assurance can be given  that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or  operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful introduction of new products and  technologies to an inability to do so. The risks associated with acquisitions are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,”  including the risk factor entitled “We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations  and harm our operating results.” We make investments in privately held companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to our  products or that provide strategic value. The risks associated with these investments are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk  Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and  in interest rates; impairment of our investments could harm our earnings.” We pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and accelerate  new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology exchange,  product development, joint sales and marketing, or new market creation. Companies with which we have added or expanded  strategic alliances during fiscal 2021 and in recent years include Apple Inc., Equinix Inc., Google LLC, International Business  Machines Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Amazon Web Services LLC, among others. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and in our view this trend  may increase. The risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including  the risk factor entitled “If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from  such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.” We compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport,  and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. These market factors  represent a competitive threat to us. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our  competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as  we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority and growth areas. As we continue to expand globally, we  may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from  competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue. Our competitors (in each case relative to only some of our products or services) include: Amazon Web Services LLC; Arista  Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; CommScope Holding Company, Inc.; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd.; CrowdStrike  Holdings, Inc.; Dell Technologies Inc.; Dynatrace Inc.; F5 Networks, Inc.; FireEye, Inc.; Fortinet, Inc.; Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise Company; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; Juniper Networks, Inc.; Lenovo Group Limited; LogMeIn, Inc.; Microsoft  Corporation; New Relic, Inc.; Nokia Corporation; Nutanix, Inc.; Palo Alto Networks, Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Ubiquiti Inc.;  VMware, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others. Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product  area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products  are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering  resources, than we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also  from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets.  We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic  alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center  is undergoing a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking,  storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and  general purpose microprocessors, application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) offering advanced services, standards-based  protocols, cloud computing and virtualization, the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning  multiple, previously independent, technology segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data  center business have made acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end  technology solutions for the enterprise data center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the  development and sale of enterprise data center technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term  strategic alliance partners. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form  alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the  ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products  and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer  value and products with price-performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value- added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to  provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models. We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer  technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time,  compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers,  and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition  and accordingly affect our chances of success. We regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. We allocate our research and  development budget among our product categories, which consist of Infrastructure Platforms, Applications, Security, and Other  Product technologies. Our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific  areas of focus being identified from time to time. Recent areas of increased focus include our networking technologies (which  encompasses switching, routing, and wireless technologies within Infrastructure Platforms), conferencing, security, and  analytics products. Our expenditures for research and development costs were expensed as incurred. The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving standards, changes in customer  requirements, and new product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our success depends, in part, on our ability, on  a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products  that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering  personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of Internet networking  products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect to continue to make acquisitions and strategic  investments, where appropriate, to provide us with access to new technologies. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that we  will be able to successfully develop products to address new customer requirements and technological changes or that those  products will achieve market acceptance. We rely on contract manufacturers for our manufacturing needs. We presently use a variety of independent third-party companies  to provide services related to printed-circuit board assembly, in-circuit test, product repair, and product assembly. Proprietary  software in electronically programmable memory chips is used to configure products that meet customer requirements and to  maintain quality control and security. The manufacturing process enables us to configure the hardware and software in unique  combinations to meet a wide variety of individual customer requirements. The manufacturing process also uses automated  testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which  are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally  certified to International Organization for Standardization 9001 standards. Our arrangements with contract manufacturers generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as  manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply; inventory management; flexibility regarding capacity, quality, and  cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property. We have not entered into any  significant long-term contracts with any manufacturing service provider. We generally have the option to renew arrangements  on an as-needed basis. These arrangements generally do not commit us to purchase any particular amount or any quantities  beyond amounts covered by orders or forecasts that we submit covering discrete periods of time. We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights,  trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks  in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We also  seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate  confidentiality agreements. We have obtained a substantial number of patents and trademarks in the United States and in other  countries. There can be no assurance, however, that the rights obtained can be successfully enforced against infringing products  in every jurisdiction. Although we believe the protection afforded by our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets has  value, the rapidly changing technology in the networking industry and uncertainties in the legal process make our future success  dependent primarily on the innovative skills, technological expertise, and management abilities of our employees rather than on  the protection afforded by patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws. Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. While it may  be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, we believe, based upon past  experience and standard industry practice, that such licenses generally could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.  Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our inability  to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation  regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.  Moreover, inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis  can limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. We have a responsibility to support our employees through times of change and enable them to be their best. We do this by  fostering a Conscious Culture. Living a Conscious Culture requires us to act with dignity, respect, fairness, and equity in each  of our interactions with one another, building a culture that allows us to become a catalyst for social change. By intentionally  creating and cultivating an inclusive work environment where employees can thrive, we believe Cisco is helping to bring about  a better world. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent  claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that our patents  and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property  rights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some  foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated  with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled  “Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce,” “We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others,”  and “We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.” Sustainability and protecting the environment are both top priorities for Cisco. We have set long-term goals to address the  environmental impacts from our products and business operations. We strive to reduce the impacts of our operations and supply chain, help our customers decrease greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions, and support our communities experiencing direct effects of a changing climate by, among others: At Cisco, we value our people, our technology, and changing the world for the better with a focus on creating a more inclusive  future. Our goal is to attract, retain, and develop talent in order to help our customers connect, secure and automate to accelerate  their digital agility in a cloud-first world. Our relationship with our employees is one of mutual benefit, our employees bring  talent and ingenuity to everything we do. In turn, we provide employees meaningful careers and development opportunities.  As a testament to this, Cisco has been named as the number one place to work on the “World’s Best Workplaces List” by Great  Places to Work and Fortune Magazine for 2019 and 2020. United States 47.9% Rest of World 52.1% •  Providing critical connectivity in the aftermath of natural disasters. Sales and marketing 31.4% General and administrative 8.9% Research and development 29.6% Cost of sales 30.1% Inclusion and diversity are core components in our Conscious Culture. Inclusivity is our strength and our priority. We want every  employee to feel valued, respected, and heard. We are prioritizing inclusion and diversity across the company, recognizing that  connecting people of all experiences and backgrounds allows us to innovate and collaborate. In order to continue accelerating  diversity and finding extraordinary talent, we have designed a framework that includes: introducing new tools and technologies  to help accurately map the talent market, creating job roles that attract highly qualified diverse candidates, and expanding the  diversity within our interview panels. We currently have a total of 29 Inclusive Communities comprised of 11 Employee Resource Organizations and 18 Employee  Networks supporting full-spectrum diversity globally, including gender, ethnicity, race, orientation, age, ability, veteran status,  religion, culture, background, as well as varied experiences, strengths, and perspectives. These thriving communities continue  to be a source of strength and support for employees, and they help to foster a more conscious culture by providing opportunities  for proximity and learning. Cisco has signed the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion Pledge. The CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge is a CEO- driven business commitment to drive measurable action and meaningful change in advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in  the workplace. We are delivering on this pledge by accelerating full-spectrum diversity — including gender, age, race, ethnicity,  orientation, ability, nationality, religion, veteran status, background, culture, experience, strengths and perspectives. At Cisco, it  starts at the top: 46% of our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) are women and 54% are diverse in terms of gender or ethnicity. We publish certain gender diversity and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. Across our global company, we have driven  broad improvements in overall workforce diversity. Based on our annual fiscal 2020 data, our global employee base was 27%  female and 73% male, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 51.8% White/Caucasian, 36.5%  Asian, 5.8% Hispanic/Latino, 4.1% African American/Black, 1.4% two or more races (Not Hispanic or Latino), and 0.4%  additional groups (including American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). With respect to social justice, Cisco is taking a stand and partnering across the globe to multiply our positive impact throughout  our communities. In September 2020, we announced our Social Justice Beliefs & Actions, which is our blueprint for how Cisco  will show up when we see inequality and injustice in the world. This work is part of a plan for Cisco to drive transformational, generational impact for vulnerable communities. Our Inclusive  Future Action Office helps drive progress and excellence in our strategic actions in this area, which are designed to address the  broader ecosystem including our employees, partners, customers and suppliers. At present, our Inclusive Future Action Office is focused on driving impacts through our strategic actions in the African  American/Black community, but these actions will be the blueprint for how we help address inequity in communities around  the world in the future. We are creating actions that can be replicated and scaled and are designed to cover the full spectrum of  diversity, inclusive of gender, generation, race, ethnicity, orientation, ability, nationality and background - the foundation of our  Conscious Culture. Our total compensation philosophy is designed to attract, reward & retain talent. It provides market competitive, performance- based compensation aligned with each employee’s contribution and impact to the value we drive to our customers, partners and  stockholders. We reward and recognize our employees for effecting innovation, collaboration, profitability, and growth within  our geographies, product lines, and functions. Cisco has always been committed to compensating our employees fairly and equitably. We are a founding signer of the White  House Equal Pay Pledge and the Parity.org pledge, and we are leading the charge to make fair pay a reality for all employees  through the Employers for Pay Equity Consortium. We have also introduced an innovative and inclusive framework that provides  us powerful analytics to evaluate our complex compensation system. For example, by using these powerful analytics, we are  able to test for pay parity on a regular basis, and when gaps are found, we strive to correct them. We have an ongoing commitment to focus on the health, safety, and well-being of our employees. We provide our employees and  their families high-quality, flexible and convenient benefits and resources for their physical, mental, and financial well-being.  Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, employees have continually had to focus on how to balance careers and personal  lives, all while managing their own physical, emotional, and financial health. During fiscal 2021, most of our global workforce  was working from home. In addition, we are moving towards a hybrid work model, giving our employees the flexibility to work offsite or onsite Cisco locations. We developed a COVID-19 response and recovery strategy with a focus on both physical and  mental health, recognizing the need to create an environment where employees can speak openly about mental health. In fiscal  2021, we continued to offer employees “A Day for Me,” which were paid days off that allowed for each individual to recharge  and rest. We believe in open-ended, self-directed learning, understanding that each individual knows what skills and resources they need  to succeed. We encourage employees to explore job roles outside of their daily work and encourage everyone to harness their  strengths and improve the way we all work. Employees choose their own path and we support that choice by providing them  tools and resources to help them achieve their career goals. We believe that strong communication is key in our Conscious Culture. This communication includes regular, virtual all hands,  which we refer to as a “Cisco Check-In,” and weekly team leader check-ins, which we refer to as a “Team Space Check-In.” Our  regular virtual Cisco Check-Ins were initially launched with a focus on sharing medical information at the start of the COVID-19  pandemic. The Cisco Check-Ins have since evolved into a forum where we can discuss much more with our employees, from  business updates to social justice to physical and mental health. In fiscal 2021, we have seen high level of employee engagement. For example, there were approximately 2 million Team Space  Check-Ins by our employees in fiscal 2021, reflecting 85% of employees submitting Team Space Check-Ins. Employees also  participate in our global Engagement Pulse Survey and the Real Deal Survey. These surveys allow our employees to provide  confidential feedback on our culture, company strategy and trust in their direct leaders. Additional information regarding Cisco’s activities related to its people and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), as well as  our workforce diversity data, can be found in our CSR Impact Report and related supplemental information, which are located  on our ESG Reporting Hub at https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/about/csr/esg-hub.html. The contents of our CSR Impact Report  and related supplemental information are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other  report or document we file with the SEC.

Risk Factors Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and  uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking  statements contained in this report. Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be  materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally, including  in most of the regions in which we sell our products and services and conduct our business operations. In the second half of fiscal 2020,  the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on our financial results and business operations, with a significant impact in the third quarter  of fiscal 2020 on our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenges and component constraints. We continue to address these  supply chain challenges and cost impacts, which we expect will continue at least through the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially  into the second half of fiscal 2022. The magnitude and duration of the disruption, its continuing impact on us, and resulting decline in  global business activity is uncertain. These disruptions include the unprecedented actions taken to try to contain the pandemic such as  travel bans and restrictions, business closures, and social distancing measures, such as quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic and the responsive measures taken in many countries have adversely affected and could in the future  materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Shelter-in-place orders and other measures,  including work-from-home and other policies implemented to protect workers, has and could in the future impact our supply chain.  Such disruptions may continue, or worsen, in the future. In addition, current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation,  such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, can also impact our ability to meet  customer demand and could materially adversely affect us. Our customers have also experienced, and may continue to experience,  disruptions in their operations, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, and increased collection risks, and which  may adversely affect our results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for  our products and services in various sectors, along with IT-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could  materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs. The recent shift to a remote working environment also creates challenges. For example, governmental lockdowns, restrictions  or new regulations has and could in the future impact the ability of our employees and vendors to work with the same speed and  productivity in certain areas, even as other areas do not see negative impact. The extent and/or duration of ongoing workforce restrictions and limitations could impact our ability to enhance, develop and support existing products and services, and hold product  sales and marketing events to the extent we were able to previously. In addition, malefactors are seeking to use the COVID-19 pandemic  to launch new cyber-attacks. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit  markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. The  inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on  our critical and significant accounting estimates. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. As  the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of  variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods. We are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and  requirements of relevant authorities. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial  performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the  timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines,  the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. Potential negative  impacts of these external factors include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on demand for our products and services;  our supply chain and sales and distribution channels; collectability of customer accounts; our ability to execute strategic plans;  impairments; and our profitability and cost structure. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business,  results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk  Factors” section. Our operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our operating results have been in the past, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of  numerous factors, some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuations in an uncertain global economic environment.  These factors include: As a consequence, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, prior results are not  necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed  elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition that could  adversely affect our stock price. Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain  geopolitical environment. Challenging economic conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed, and may continue to contribute, to slowdowns  in the communications and networking industries at large, as well as in specific segments and markets in which we operate,  resulting in: reduced demand for our products as a result of continued constraints on IT-related capital spending by our customers,  particularly service providers, and other customer markets as well; increased price competition for our products, not only from  our competitors but also as a consequence of customers disposing of unutilized products; risk of excess and obsolete inventories;  risk of supply constraints; risk of excess facilities and manufacturing capacity; and higher overhead costs as a percentage of  revenue and higher interest expense. The global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent, and is being significantly impacted by  the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2020 and the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we continued to see a broad-based weakening  in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise markets. We also experienced  continuing weakness in emerging countries, and we expect ongoing uncertainty in this market. Additionally, instability in the  global credit markets, the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy, the instability in the geopolitical  environment in many parts of the world including as a result of the United Kingdom “Brexit” withdrawal from the European  Union, the current economic challenges in China, including global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties,  and other disruptions may continue to put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions,  or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on our  business, operating results, and financial condition. Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions particularly  germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment. In addition, reports of certain intelligence  gathering methods of the U.S. government could affect customers’ perception of the products of IT companies which design  and manufacture products in the United States. Trust and confidence in us as an IT supplier are critical to the development and  growth of our markets. Impairment of that trust, or foreign regulatory actions taken in response to reports of certain intelligence  gathering methods of the U.S. government, could affect the demand for our products from customers outside of the United States  and could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Our revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results. As a result of a variety of factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in  light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment, the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,  and related market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline as it did in the first quarter  of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, and in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial expectations  could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We  have experienced periods of time during which shipments have exceeded net bookings or manufacturing issues have delayed  shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period,  nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and  periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In  addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future,  and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that  revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter. The timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter. From  time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order  is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such  orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter  to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue. Longer than normal manufacturing  lead times in the past have caused, and in the future could cause, some customers to place the same or a similar order multiple  times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon shipment or receipt of the product, or to also  place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or  risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue. Further, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead- time performance may result in more variability and less predictability in our revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer  expectations, which in turn contribute to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. For example, in fiscal 2021, we  increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the supply chain challenges seen industrywide due to component  shortages, caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten  lead times could also lead to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our  expectations. We plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the  impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results  being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business  changes. Any of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results. Supply chain issues, including financial problems of contract manufacturers or component suppliers, or a shortage of  adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill  orders, could have an adverse impact on our business and operating results, and our failure to estimate customer demand  properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply, which could adversely affect our gross margins. The fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facilities and that we are reliant on our extended supply  chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our products and on our business and operating results. Financial problems  of either contract manufacturers or component suppliers, reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturers  by other companies, and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier markets, such as the  semiconductor market, in each case, could either limit supply or increase costs. A reduction or interruption in supply, including disruptions on our global supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic  or a significant natural disaster (including as a result of climate change); a significant increase in the price of one or more  components; a failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturers; a failure to appropriately  cancel, reschedule, or adjust our requirements based on our business needs; or a decrease in demand for our products could  materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition and could materially damage customer  relationships. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase  components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to  purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price when the components are actually used, our gross margins  could decrease. In addition, vendors may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customers for business, regulatory  or political reasons, and/or demand changes in agreed pricing as a condition of supply. Although we have generally secured  additional supply or taken other mitigation actions when significant disruptions have occurred, if similar situations occur in the  future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our growth and ability to meet customer demands depend in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from our  suppliers and contract manufacturers. We have experienced component shortages in the past, including shortages caused by  manufacturing process issues, that have affected our operations, including longer than normal lead times. There is currently  a market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply which has affected, and could further affect, lead times, the  cost of that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products if we cannot secure sufficient supply in a timely  manner. We expect these supply chain challenges and cost impacts to continue through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 and  potentially into the second half of fiscal 2022. Additionally, we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component  parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity  problems experienced by our suppliers or contract manufacturers including capacity or cost problems resulting from industry  consolidation, or strong demand for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our  suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to  establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for  which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products.  During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and  we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components  at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed.  Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to  the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we  are currently experiencing. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although in  many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a  single source or limited sources, and a global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the   availability of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there  are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify  sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and  future sales. We believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow  quickly, which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity; as we acquire companies and new  technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for  certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets. Manufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. We purchase components  from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During  the normal course of business, in order to improve manufacturing lead-time performance and to help ensure adequate component  supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based  upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain instances, these agreements  allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being  placed. When facing component supply-related challenges we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to  meet customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. For example, in  fiscal 2021, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the supply chain challenges seen industrywide  due to component shortages, caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases in our inventory and purchase  commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to significant excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our  products is less than our expectations. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, an oversupply of parts could result in  excess or obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. For additional information regarding our purchase  commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable. Changes in service gross margin may result from various factors such as changes in the mix between technical support services  and advanced services, as well as the timing of technical support service contract initiations and renewals and the addition of  personnel and other resources to support higher levels of service business in future periods. •  Increases in material, labor or other manufacturing-related costs (i.e. component costs, broker fees, expedited  freight and overtime) or higher supply chain logistics costs, any of which could be significant, especially during  periods of supply constraints for certain costs, such as those impacting the market for components, including  semiconductors and memory Sales to the service provider market are especially volatile, and weakness in orders from this industry may harm our  operating results and financial condition. Sales to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchases, especially relating to our router  sales and sales of certain other Infrastructure Platforms and Applications products, in addition to longer sales cycles. Service  provider product orders decreased during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the  past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product  orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could  persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage  of completion of expanding network infrastructures; the availability of funding; and the extent to which service providers are  affected by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry,  including as a result of any slowdown in capital expenditures by service providers (which may be more prevalent during a global  economic downturn, or periods of economic, political or regulatory uncertainty), could have a material adverse effect on our  business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this  industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective  markets. For example, in the past, many of our service provider customers have been materially and adversely affected by  slowdowns in the general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments,  and by constraints on capital availability, resulting in business failures and substantial reductions in spending and expansion  plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business  and operating results in any future period. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles;  require a broader range of services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require  acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors  can add further risk to business conducted with service providers. Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins. If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, or if our distributors’ financial condition or operations  weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold  through our channel partners, and the remainder is sold through direct sales. Our channel partners include systems integrators,  service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users  and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network  equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution, and a number of service  providers are also systems integrators. Distributors stock inventory and typically sell to systems integrators, service providers,  and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. If sales through  indirect channels increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our products and, to a degree, the timing  of orders from our customers. Historically, we have seen fluctuations in our gross margins based on changes in the balance of our distribution channels. There  can be no assurance that changes in the balance of our distribution model in future periods would not have an adverse effect  on our gross margins and profitability. Some factors could result in disruption of or changes in our distribution model, which  could harm our sales and margins, including the following: competition with some of our channel partners, including through  our direct sales, which may lead these channel partners to use other suppliers that do not directly sell their own products or  otherwise compete with them; some of our channel partners may demand that we absorb a greater share of the risks that their  customers may ask them to bear; some of our channel partners may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able  to withstand changes and challenges in business conditions; and revenue from indirect sales could suffer if our distributors’  financial condition or operations weaken. In addition, we depend on our channel partners globally to comply with applicable  regulatory requirements. To the extent that they fail to do so, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating  results, and financial condition. Further, sales of our products outside of agreed territories can result in disruption to our  distribution channels. The markets in which we compete are intensely competitive, which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies, and a migration to networking and  communications solutions that offer relative advantages. These market factors represent a competitive threat to us. We compete  with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may  increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas,  and in key priority and growth areas. For example, as products related to network programmability, such as software defined  networking (SDN) products, become more prevalent, we expect to face increased competition from companies that develop  networking products based on commoditized hardware, referred to as “white box” hardware, to the extent customers decide to  purchase those product offerings instead of ours. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors to enter the market. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic  regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and  we anticipate this will continue. For information regarding our competitors, see the section entitled “Competition” contained  in Item 1. Business of this report. Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area.  Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly  formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources, including technical and engineering resources, than  we do. As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors but also from other  competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets. We also  sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in  some areas may be competitors in other areas, and this trend may increase. For example, the enterprise data center is undergoing  a fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and  software, that previously were segregated. Due to several factors, including the availability of highly scalable and general  purpose microprocessors, ASICs offering advanced services, standards based protocols, cloud computing and virtualization,  the convergence of technologies within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple, previously independent, technology  segments. Also, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions, or  announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them to provide end-to-end technology solutions for the enterprise data  center. As a result of all of these developments, we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center  technologies, including competition from entities that are among our long-term strategic alliance partners. Companies that are  strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing  their business with us. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the  ability to sell successful business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products  and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer  value and products with price-performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value- added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to  provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models. We also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer  technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time  compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers,  and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition  and accordingly affect our chances of success. If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances, and  we may experience increased competition or delays in product development. We have several strategic alliances with large and complex organizations and other companies with which we work to offer  complementary products and services and, in the past, have established a joint venture to market services associated with our  Cisco Unified Computing System products. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is  generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standards. There can be no assurance we will realize the  expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from the joint venture. If successful, these relationships may be mutually  beneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in  some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company  in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we  could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties. Joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the  potentially different interests of joint venture partners. Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm  our gross margins. We must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our  results of operations. Our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory  is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our  products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user  demand. Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for  changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of  focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory  obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. When facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. If we ultimately  determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result  in lower gross margins. We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if  we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers’ changing needs, our operating results and  market share may suffer. The markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, new  product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on  our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production  costs of existing products. If customers do not purchase and/or renew our offerings our business could be harmed. The COVID-19  pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with  IT-related capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to  adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs. The process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related  to other market transitions— such as security, digital transformation and IoT, and cloud— is complex and uncertain, and if we  fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must  commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new  products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept. In  particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve  as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and  investments may be of no or limited value. For example, if we do not introduce products related to network programmability,  such as software-defined-networking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed  are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based  on “white box” hardware, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail  to develop in a timely fashion, offerings to address other transitions, or if the offerings addressing these other transitions that  ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, different from ours. In addition, our business could  be adversely affected in periods surrounding our new product introductions if customers delay purchasing decisions to qualify  or otherwise evaluate the new product offerings. We have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual  products and services to selling products and services integrated into architectures and solutions, and we are seeking to meet  the evolving needs of customers which include offering our products and solutions in the manner in which customers wish to  consume them. As a part of this transformation, we continue to make changes to how we are organized and how we build and  deliver our technology, including changes in our business models with customers. If our strategy for addressing our customer  needs, or the architectures and solutions we develop do not meet those needs, or the changes we are making in how we are  organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective, our business could be harmed. Furthermore, we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenges with regard to product planning  and timing, technical hurdles that we fail to overcome in a timely fashion, or a lack of appropriate resources. This could result in  competitors, some of which may also be our strategic alliance partners, providing those solutions before we do and loss of market  share, revenue, and earnings. In addition, the growth in demand for technology delivered as a service enables new competitors  to enter the market. The success of new products and services depends on several factors, including proper new product and  service definition, component costs, timely completion and introduction of these products and services, differentiation of new  products and services from those of our competitors, and market acceptance of these products and services. There can be no  assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and  services to market in a timely manner, or achieve market acceptance of our products and services or that products, services  and technologies developed by others will not render our products, services or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. The  products and technologies in our other product categories and key priority and growth areas may not prove to have the market  success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services. Changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our  products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we may be required to strategically realign our resources and to  consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses. Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment  in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses, may result in the recording of special charges, such as inventory and technology- related write-offs, workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities, or claims  from third parties who were resellers or users of discontinued products. Our estimates with respect to the useful life or  ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets, including purchased intangible assets, could change as a result of such assessments and decisions. Although in certain instances our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and  adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed, our loss contingencies may include  liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers. Further, our estimates relating to  the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions. Additionally, we are required to  perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances, and future goodwill  impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings. We initiated a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which  included a voluntary early retirement program, and which has now been substantially completed. Our business may not be more  efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan. Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and  the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and  financial condition. Over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and in key priority and growth  areas, and these investments may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits which could harm our operating results. While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other  resources related to our engineering, sales, service and marketing functions as we realign and dedicate resources on key priority  and growth areas, such as Security and Applications, and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in Infrastructure  Platforms and in Services. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the  anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do  not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments (including if our selection of areas for investment does not play out  as we expect), or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected. We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions that could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results. Our growth depends upon market growth, our ability to enhance our existing products, and our ability to introduce new products on  a timely basis. We intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and enhance existing products through acquisitions  of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control,  and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely  affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could  materially harm our business and operating results. Prior acquisitions have resulted in a wide range of outcomes, from successful  introduction of new products and technologies to a failure to do so. Even when an acquired company has already developed  and marketed products, there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that pre- acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such products. In addition, our  effective tax rate for future periods is uncertain and could be impacted by mergers and acquisitions. Risks related to new product  development also apply to acquisitions. Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our  service and support operations. As we focus on new market opportunities and key priority and growth areas, we will increasingly compete with large  telecommunications equipment suppliers as well as startup companies. Several of our competitors may have greater resources,  including technical and engineering resources, than we do. Additionally, as customers in these markets complete infrastructure  deployments, they may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past, especially in  emerging countries. Demand for these types of service, support, or financing contracts may increase in the future. There can be  no assurance that we can provide products, service, support, and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunities.  Further, entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, particularly to those markets, including  the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence. For example, as we add direct selling capabilities  globally to meet changing customer demands, we will face increased legal and regulatory requirements. Industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating results. There is a continuing trend toward industry consolidation in our markets. We expect this trend to continue as companies  attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to  continue operations. For example, some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made  acquisitions, or announced new strategic alliances, designed to position them with the ability to provide end-to-end technology  solutions for the enterprise data center. Companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire  or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe that industry consolidation may  result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to more  variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial  condition. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the  effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed  of more numerous participants. Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income. We produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software  typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. There can be no assurance that our pre- shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect  numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, or affect gross margins.  From time to time, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects  or bugs in products that we had shipped. There can be no assurance that such remediation, depending on the product involved,  would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or  permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, or product reengineering expenses,  any of which could have a material impact on our revenue, margins, and net income. Due to the global nature of our operations, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region  could harm our operating results and financial condition. We conduct significant sales and customer support operations in countries around the world. As such, our growth depends in  part on our increasing sales into emerging countries. We also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers,  component suppliers and distribution partners. Our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in  orders in the first half of fiscal 2021 and in certain prior periods. We continue to assess the sustainability of any improvements  in our business in these countries and there can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful. Our  future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors relating to our operations  inside and outside the United States, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and  financial condition, including the following: impacts from global central bank monetary policy; issues related to the political  relationship between the United States and other countries that can affect regulatory matters, affect the willingness of customers  in those countries to purchase products from companies headquartered in the United States or affect our ability to procure components if a government body were to deny us access to those components; government-related disruptions or shutdowns;  the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment; foreign currency exchange rates; political or social unrest;  economic instability or weakness or natural disasters in a specific country or region, including economic challenges in China  and global economic ramifications of Chinese economic difficulties; instability as a result of Brexit; environmental protection  regulations (including new laws and regulations related to climate change), trade protection measures such as tariffs, and other  legal and regulatory requirements, some of which may affect our ability to import our products to, export our products from,  or sell our products in various countries or affect our ability to procure components; political considerations that affect service  provider and government spending patterns; health or similar issues, including pandemics or epidemics such as the COVID-19  pandemic which could continue to affect customer purchasing decisions; difficulties in staffing and managing international  operations; and adverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on our global operations. We are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result  in material losses. Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local  customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the United States. Beyond our open credit arrangements, we have also  experienced demands for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangements. Our loan financing arrangements may  include not only financing the acquisition of our products and services but also providing additional funds for other costs  associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Our exposure to the credit risks relating to our  financing activities may increase if our customers are adversely affected by a global economic downturn or periods of economic  uncertainty. There can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective.  In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing  arrangements, particularly among Internet businesses and service providers, causing us to incur economic or financial losses.  There can be no assurance that additional losses will not be incurred. Although these losses have not been material to date,  future losses, if incurred, could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial  condition. Additionally, to the degree that turmoil in the credit markets makes it more difficult for some customers to obtain  financing, those customers’ ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on  our business, operating results, and financial condition. We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates; impairment of our  investments could harm our earnings. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our portfolio includes available-for-sale debt  investments and equity investments, the values of which are subject to market price volatility. If such investments suffer market  price declines, as we experienced with some of our investments in the past, we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair  value of our investments below their cost basis. Our privately held investments are subject to risk of loss of investment capital.  These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are  typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. For information  regarding the market risks associated with the fair value of portfolio investments and interest rates, refer to the section titled  “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows. Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in  foreign currency exchange rates, including emerging market currencies which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase  in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States  where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw  materials to the extent that we must purchase components in foreign currencies. These exposures may change over time as  business practices evolve, and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Failure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objectives. Our success has always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, and  marketing personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially in the Silicon Valley area of Northern California.  Stock incentive plans are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and provide incentives for them to  remain with us. Volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive awards, or changes to our  overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, resulting from the management of share dilution and  share-based compensation expense or otherwise, may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. As a result of  one or more of these factors, we may increase our hiring in geographic areas outside the United States, which could subject us  to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk. The loss of services of any of our key personnel; the inability to retain and  attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly engineering and sales personnel, could make it difficult to meet key objectives, such as timely and effective product introductions. In addition, companies in our  industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in improper hiring  practices. We have received these claims in the past and may receive additional claims to this effect in the future. Adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigations may harm our operating results or financial condition. We are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal  business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of  lawsuits or governmental investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial  condition. For additional information regarding certain of the matters in which we are involved, see Note 14 to the Consolidated  Financial Statements, subsection (f) “Legal Proceedings.” Our operating results may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of  counterfeit versions of our products. As is the case with leading products around the world, our products are subject to efforts by third parties to produce counterfeit  versions of our products. While we work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture  of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale, and to detect counterfeit products in customer networks, and have succeeded in  prosecuting counterfeiters and their distributors, resulting in fines, imprisonment and restitution to us, there can be no guarantee  that such efforts will succeed. While counterfeiters often aim their sales at customers who might not have otherwise purchased  our products due to lack of verifiability of origin and service, such counterfeit sales, to the extent they replace otherwise  legitimate sales, could adversely affect our operating results. Changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could  adversely affect our results. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in  countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation  of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income, global intangible low-tax income  and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives;  by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible  compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws  and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries,  the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required  to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries,  including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.  There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted by countries, will not  have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital  investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these  commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination  of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of  adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can  be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results  and financial condition. Our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events  (including as a result of global climate change). Our corporate headquarters, including certain of our research and development operations are located in the Silicon Valley area  of Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, a certain number of our facilities are located near  rivers that have experienced flooding in the past. Also certain of our suppliers and logistics centers are located in regions that  have been or may be affected by earthquake, tsunami and flooding activity which in the past has disrupted, and in the future  could disrupt, the flow of components and delivery of products. In addition, global climate change may result in significant  natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and  flooding. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, a hurricane, volcano, flood or a wildfire, could have a material  adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Terrorism and other events may harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat, or any future acts  of terrorism, may cause further disruptions to the economies of the United States and other countries and create further  uncertainties or otherwise materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Likewise, events such as loss  of infrastructure and utilities services such as energy, transportation, or telecommunications could have similar negative impacts.  To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or  shipment of our products, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. There can be no assurance that our operating results and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence  of debt. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of $11.5 billion that  mature at specific dates from calendar year 2021 through 2040. We have also established a commercial paper program under  which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate  amount outstanding at any time of $10.0 billion, and we had no commercial paper notes outstanding under this program as of  July 31, 2021. There can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be a better means of providing  liquidity to us than would our use of our existing cash resources. Further, we cannot be assured that our maintenance of this  indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating results or financial condition. In  addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and  equity securities, as well as the terms upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuances. Risks Related to Intellectual Property Our proprietary rights may prove difficult to enforce. We generally rely on patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our  technology and products. Although we have been issued numerous patents and other patent applications are currently pending,  there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented  or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us. Furthermore, many key aspects of networking technology  are governed by industrywide standards, which are usable by all market entrants. In addition, there can be no assurance that  patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our  technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the  laws of the United States. The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were  determined under the laws of the United States. Although we are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for  particular segments of the business for which we compete, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights to the totality of the  features (including aspects of products protected other than by patent rights) in a market, we may find ourselves at a competitive  disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time, and effort required to create innovative products that  have enabled us to be successful. We may be found to infringe on intellectual property rights of others. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive  patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to  us. These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims  assertions, particularly in the United States. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the  secrecy of some pending patents, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is not economically practical or even possible  to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components infringes or will infringe on the patent rights of others.  The asserted claims and/or initiated litigation can include claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, or customers,  alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products or components of those products.  Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and  management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. Where claims are  made by customers, resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships. There can be no assurance  that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be  adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers. Furthermore, because of the potential  for high court awards that are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims settled for  significant amounts. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful,  if we are required to indemnify a customer with respect to a claim against the customer, or if we fail to develop non-infringing  technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results,  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. For additional information regarding our indemnification  obligations, see Note 14(e) to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report. Our exposure to risks associated  with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the  development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Further, in the  past, third parties have made infringement and similar claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior  to our acquisition. We rely on the availability of third-party licenses. Many of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary  in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary  licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such  licenses or rights on favorable terms, or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters, could have a material adverse effect  on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual  property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. Cyber-attacks, data breaches or malware may disrupt our operations, harm our operating results and financial condition,  and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business; and cyber-attacks or data breaches on our customers’  networks, or in cloud-based services provided by or enabled by us, could result in claims of liability against us, damage our  reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. We experience cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis, and we anticipate  continuing to be subject to such attempts. Despite our implementation of security measures, (i) our products and services, and  (ii) the servers, data centers, and cloud-based solutions on which our and third-party data is stored, are vulnerable to cyber- attacks, data breaches, malware, and disruptions from unauthorized access, tampering or other theft or misuse, including by  employees, malicious actors or inadvertent error. Such events have and could in the future compromise or disrupt access to or the  operation of our products, services, and networks or those of our customers, or result in the information stored on our systems  or those of our customers being improperly accessed, processed, disclosed, lost or stolen. We have not to date experienced a  material event; however, the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers,  business partners and others, give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, could damage our reputation or otherwise materially  harm our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Efforts to  limit the ability of malicious actors to disrupt the operations of the Internet or undermine our own security efforts may be costly  to implement and may not be successful. Breaches of security in our customers’ networks, or in cloud-based services provided  by or enabled by us, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services, could result  in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization decisions regarding remedying vulnerabilities or security defects,  failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or  deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation,  or otherwise materially harm our business. The products and services we sell to customers, and our cloud-based solutions, inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical  security defects which have not been remedied and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We also make  prioritization decisions in determining which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes. Customers  may also need to test security releases before they can be deployed which can delay implementation. In addition, we rely on  third-party providers of software and cloud-based services, and we cannot control the rate at which they remedy vulnerabilities.  When customers do not deploy specific releases, or decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our products, services or cloud- based solutions containing the release, they may be left vulnerable. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, prioritization  errors in remedying vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remedy vulnerabilities or security  defects, or customers not deploying specific releases or deciding not to upgrade products, services or solutions could result in  claims of liability against us, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed by regulatory uncertainty applicable to  our products and services. Changes in regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate, in the United States and in other countries,  could materially affect the sales of our products and services. In particular, changes in telecommunications regulations could  impact our service provider customers’ purchase of our products and offers, and they could also impact sales of our own  regulated offers. In addition, evolving legal requirements restricting or controlling the collection, processing, or cross-border  transmission of data, including regulation of cloud-based services, could materially affect our customers’ ability to use, and our  ability to sell, our products and offers. Additional areas of uncertainty that could impact sales of our products and offers include  laws and regulations related to encryption technology, environmental sustainability (including climate change), export control,  product certification, and national security controls applicable to our supply chain. For example, new laws and regulations in  response to climate change could result in increased energy efficiency for our products and increased compliance and energy  costs. Changes in regulatory requirements in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating  results, and financial condition. In addition to our headquarters site, we own additional sites in the United States, which include facilities in the surrounding  areas of San Jose, California; Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Richardson, Texas; and Lawrenceville, Georgia. We also  own land for expansion in some of these locations. In addition, we lease office space in many U.S. locations. Outside the United States our operations are conducted primarily in leased sites. Other significant sites (in addition to the two  non-U.S. headquarters locations) are located in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Poland,  and the United Kingdom. We believe that our existing facilities, including both owned and leased, are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of  our business. Item 3.  Legal Proceedings For a description of pending legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 14 “Commitments and Contingencies - (f)  Legal Proceedings” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,  which is incorporated herein by reference. Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Stock Our stock price may be volatile. Historically, our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility, particularly as a result of variations between our  actual financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and  us. Furthermore, speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, results of  operations, business, security of our products, or significant transactions can cause changes in our stock price. In addition, the  stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology  companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These factors,  as well as general economic and political conditions and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisitions or other  significant transactions, or any difficulties associated with such transactions, by us or our current or potential competitors,  may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future. Additionally, volatility, lack of positive  performance in our stock price or changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may  adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, virtually all of whom are compensated, in part, based on the performance  of our stock price. Item 1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2.  Properties Our corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in San Jose, California, in the United States of America. The locations  of our headquarters by geographic segment are as follows: Item 5.

For the majority of restricted stock units granted, the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of  shares withheld to meet applicable tax withholding requirements. Although these withheld shares are not issued or considered  common stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and therefore are not included in the preceding table, they are  treated as common stock repurchases in our financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been  issued upon vesting (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results  of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe  harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed  forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about  the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,”  “targets,” “goals,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “momentum,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “endeavors,”  “strives,” “may,” variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in  our businesses, future responses to and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other characterizations of future events or  circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are only predictions  and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those under “Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors,” and elsewhere herein. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any  forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason. Cisco designs and sells a broad range of technologies that power the Internet. We are integrating our platforms across networking,  security, collaboration, applications and the cloud.

As customers have accelerated their  digitization and cloud investments stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on executing and innovating to  support and assist that transition. In the second half of fiscal 2021, we began to see customers prepare for office re-openings  and hybrid work by increasing investments in their technologies. Total revenue increased by 1% compared with fiscal 2020.  Our product revenue reflected growth in Security, partially offset by declines in Applications. Infrastructure Platforms was  flat. We continued to make progress in the transition of our business model delivering increased software and subscriptions.  We remain focused on accelerating innovation across our portfolio, and we believe that we have made continued progress on  our strategic priorities. We continue to operate in a challenging macroeconomic and highly competitive environment. While  the overall environment remains uncertain, we continue to aggressively invest in priority areas with the objective of driving  profitable growth over the long term. Within total revenue, product revenue was flat and service revenue increased by 4%. Fiscal 2021 had 53 weeks, compared with  52 weeks in fiscal 2020, thus our results for fiscal 2021 reflect an extra week compared with fiscal 2020. We estimate that a  majority of our revenue increase was attributable to the extra week. In fiscal 2021, total software revenue was $15.0 billion across  all product areas and service, an increase of 7%. Within total software revenue, subscription revenue increased 15%. Total gross  margin decreased by 0.3 percentage points. Product gross margin decreased by 0.2 percentage points, due to lower productivity  benefits largely driven by ongoing costs related to supply chain constraints. The effect of pricing erosion was moderate. We  have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage, including  revising supplier arrangements, to address supply chain challenges. As a percentage of revenue, research and development,  sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, collectively, increased by 0.7 percentage points. The total impact  associated with the extra week on our cost of sales and operating expenses was approximately $150 million (excluding the  impact of share-based compensation expense). Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.8 percentage points.  We incurred restructuring and other charges of $886 million, which resulted in a decrease of 6% in net income and a decrease  of 5% in diluted earnings per share. In terms of our geographic segments, revenue from the Americas decreased by $0.1 billion, EMEA revenue increased by  $0.3 billion and revenue in our APJC segment increased by $0.4 billion. The “BRICM” countries experienced a product revenue  decline of 6% in the aggregate, driven by a decrease in product revenue across each of the BRICM countries with the exception  of India. From a customer market standpoint, we experienced product revenue growth in the public sector and service provider markets  partially offset by declines in the enterprise and commercial markets. As fiscal 2021 progressed, we saw improvement in business  momentum in our customer markets, which we believe was related to an improving global macroeconomic environment. From a product category perspective, total product revenue was flat year over year, driven by growth in revenue in Security of  7%, offset by a product revenue decline in Applications of 1%. Infrastructure Platforms was flat. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, total revenue increased by 8%. Within  total revenue, product revenue increased by 10% and service revenue increased by 3%. With regard to our geographic segment  performance, on a year-over-year basis, revenue in the Americas, EMEA and APJC increased by 8%, 6% and 13%, respectively.  From a product category perspective, we experienced product revenue growth in Infrastructure Platforms and Security, offset by  declines in Applications. Total gross margin increased by 0.4 percentage points, driven by productivity benefits, and to a lesser  extent, favorable product mix, partially offset by pricing erosion. As a percentage of revenue, research and development, sales  and marketing, and general and administrative expenses collectively increased by 0.5 percentage points. Operating income as a  percentage of revenue increased by 0.5 percentage points. Net income increased by 14% and diluted earnings per share increased  by 15%. During this extraordinary time, our priority has been supporting our employees, customers, partners and communities, while  positioning Cisco for the future. The pandemic has driven organizations across the globe to digitize their operations and support  remote workforces at a faster speed and greater scale than ever before. We remain focused on providing the technology and  solutions our customers need to accelerate their digital organizations.

Strategy and Priorities As our customers add billions of new connections to their enterprises, and as more applications move to a multicloud  environment, the network becomes even more critical. Our customers are navigating change at an unprecedented pace and our  mission is to shape the future of the Internet by inspiring new possibilities for them by helping transform their infrastructure,  expand applications and analytics, address their security needs, and empower their teams. We believe that our customers are  looking for outcomes that are data-driven and provide meaningful business value through automation, security, and analytics  across private, hybrid, and multicloud environments. Our strategy is to help our customers connect, secure, and automate in  order to accelerate their digital agility in a cloud-first world. For a full discussion of our strategy and priorities, see “Item 1. Business.” Other Key Financial Measures The following is a summary of our other key financial measures for fiscal 2021 compared with fiscal 2020 (in millions): •  Most of our global workforce is working from home. •  Seamless transition to work from home with a long-standing flexible work policy, and we build the technologies that  allow organizations to stay connected, secure and productive. •  For the remainder who must be in the office to perform their roles, we are focused on their health and safety, and are  taking all of the necessary precautions. •  Provided a variety of free offers and trials for our Webex and security technologies as they dramatically shifted entire  workforces to be remote. •  Committed significant funds to support both global and local pandemic response efforts. •  Provided technology and financial support for non-profits, first responders, and governments. •  Donated personal protective equipment to hospital workers including N95 masks and face shields 3D-printed by  Cisco volunteers around the world. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted  in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the  Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the  significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The accounting  policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant  judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and actual results  could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies. The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19  pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on  our significant judgments, assumptions and estimates that are reflected in our results for fiscal 2021. These estimates include:  goodwill and identified purchased intangible assets and income taxes, among other items. The actual results that we experience  may differ materially from our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our estimates could require increased  judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially  in future periods. We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally  distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may contain multiple performance  obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or  service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product  or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract. We classify our hardware, perpetual  software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses represent multiple obligations, which  include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver hardware or software, we are typically  the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that  reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once  the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software  is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control  can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term.  Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon  transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized  upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as  services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of  the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue  recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration  from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes. Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled  to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance  obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or  service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly  observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in  identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration  when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and  various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and  customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying  the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes  available. We also consider the customers' right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. If actual credits  received by distributors under these programs were to deviate significantly from our estimates, which are based on historical  experience, our revenue could be adversely affected. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. We consider the likelihood of the  incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies.  An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be  reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be made or  adjusted and whether new accruals are required. Third parties, including customers, have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to exclusive  patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us.  These assertions have increased over time as a result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claims assertions,  particularly in the United States. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is  successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms  and conditions, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established valuation  techniques. Goodwill represents a residual value as of the acquisition date, which in most cases results in measuring goodwill  as an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company  over the fair value of net assets acquired, including contingent consideration. We perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual  basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances for each reporting unit. The assessment of  fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible assets is based on factors that market participants would use in an orderly  transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial assets. In response to changes in industry and market conditions, we could be required to strategically realign our resources and  consider restructuring, disposing of, or otherwise exiting businesses, which could result in an impairment of goodwill. There  was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. For the annual impairment testing in fiscal 2021, the excess of  the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting units was $80.3 billion for the Americas, $73.0 billion for EMEA,  and $33.2 billion for APJC. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we performed a sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of  our respective reporting units and determined that a hypothetical 10% decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not  result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit. The fair value of acquired technology and patents, as well as acquired technology under development, is determined at acquisition  date primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value. The discount rates used  in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and then adjusted to  reflect risks inherent in the development lifecycle as appropriate. We consider the pricing model for products related to these  acquisitions to be standard within the high-technology communications industry, and the applicable discount rates represent the  rates that market participants would use for valuation of such intangible assets. We make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in  circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. Recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured  by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate. We  review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  that the asset might be impaired. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the  difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. Assumptions and estimates about future values  and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective. They can be affected by a variety of  factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business  strategy and our internal forecasts. Our ongoing consideration of all the factors described previously could result in impairment  charges in the future, which could adversely affect our net income. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates differ from the  statutory rate, primarily due to the tax impact of state taxes, foreign operations, R&D tax credits, foreign-derived intangible  income deductions, global intangible low-taxed income, tax audit settlements, nondeductible compensation, international  realignments, and transfer pricing adjustments. Our effective tax rate was 20.1%, 19.7%, and 20.2% in fiscal 2021, 2020, and  2019, respectively. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not  be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We adjust these reserves in light of  changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final  tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes  in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and  changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing  the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, estimates of future  taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of  deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for  income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. Our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated  in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the  valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes to foreign-derived intangible income deduction, global intangible  low-tax income and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof; by expiration of or lapses  in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of  nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by  changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign  subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment  is required to determine the recognition and measurement attributes prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in  income taxes. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised  of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long- standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted  by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. As a result of certain of our ongoing employment  and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries was subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure  to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to the continuous  examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess  the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income  taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse impact on our  operating results and financial condition. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Total revenue in fiscal 2021 increased by 1% compared with fiscal 2020. Product revenue was flat and service revenue increased  by 4%. Our total revenue reflected growth in EMEA and APJC. Americas was flat. Product revenue for the emerging countries  of BRICM, in the aggregate, experienced a 6% product revenue decline, with decreases in each of these countries with the  exception of India. In addition to the impact of macroeconomic factors, including the IT spending environment and the level of spending by  government entities, revenue by segment in a particular period may be significantly impacted by several factors related to  revenue recognition, including the complexity of transactions such as multiple performance obligations; the mix of financing  arrangements provided to channel partners and customers; and final acceptance of the product, system, or solution, among other  factors. In addition, certain customers tend to make large and sporadic purchases, and the revenue related to these transactions  may also be affected by the timing of revenue recognition, which in turn would impact the revenue of the relevant segment. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 is presented  below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 can  be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 25, 2020, filed with the SEC on  September 3, 2020. We manage our business primarily on a geographic basis, organized into three geographic segments. Our revenue, which  includes product and service for each segment, is summarized in the following table (in millions, except percentages): APJC. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   7,706 7,352 7,877 354 5% Percentage of revenue  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   15.5% 14.9% 15.2%   Product . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 36,014 $ 35,978 $ 39,005 $ 36 —% Service  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   13,804 13,323 12,899 481 4% Percentage of revenue  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   27.7% 27.0% 24.9% Americas  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 29,161 $ 29,291 $ 30,927 $ (130) —% EMEA  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   12,951 12,659 13,100 292 2% Percentage of revenue  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   26.0% 25.7% 25.2%   Percentage of revenue  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   72.3% 73.0% 75.1% Percentage of revenue  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   58.5% 59.4% 59.6% Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 49,818 $ 49,301 $ 51,904 $ 517 1% Total  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 49,818 $ 49,301 $ 51,904 $ 517 1% July 31, 36 Years Ended 2021 vs. 2020 Years Ended 2021 vs. 2020 July 25, Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Product revenue in the Americas segment decreased by 2%. The product revenue decrease was driven by declines in the  enterprise and commercial markets, partially offset by growth in the public sector and service provider markets. From a country  perspective, product revenue decreased by 1% in the United States, 18% in Mexico, and 9% in Brazil, partially offset by a  product revenue increase of 4% in Canada. The increase in product revenue in the EMEA segment of 2% was driven by growth in the service provider and public sector  markets, partially offset by declines in the commercial and enterprise markets. Product revenue from emerging countries within  EMEA decreased by 7%, and product revenue for the remainder of the EMEA segment, which primarily consists of countries  in Western Europe, increased by 4%. From a country perspective, product revenue increased by 4% in Germany, partially offset  by declines in the United Kingdom and France by 1% and 2%, respectively. Product revenue in the APJC segment increased by 4%, driven by growth in the public sector, service provider and enterprise  markets, partially offset by declines in the commercial market. From a country perspective, product revenue increased in Japan,  Australia and India by 11%, 6% and 3%, respectively, partially offset by a decline of 4% in China.

We report our product revenue in the following categories: Infrastructure Platforms,  Applications, Security, and Other Products. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to  conform to the current period’s presentation. The Infrastructure Platforms product category represents our core networking offerings related to switching, routing, wireless,  and the data center. Infrastructure Platforms revenue was flat compared to fiscal 2020, with growth in routing and wireless,  offset by declines in switching and data center. This was the product area most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic environment  in the first half of fiscal 2021. Switching revenue declined in both campus switching and data center switching, although we  had strong revenue growth in our Catalyst 9000 Series, Meraki switching offerings and Nexus 9000 Series. We experienced an  increase in sales of routing products, with growth primarily in the service provider market. Wireless had strong growth driven  by our Meraki and WiFi-6 products. Revenue from data center declined driven by continued market contraction impacting  primarily our servers products. The Applications product category includes our collaboration offerings (unified communications, Cisco TelePresence and  conferencing) as well as IoT and AppDynamics analytics software offerings. Revenue in our Applications product category  decreased by 1%, or $64 million, with a decline in Unified Communications and Cisco TelePresence partially offset by double  digit growth in IoT software offerings and growth in Webex.

The effect of pricing erosion was moderate driven by typical market factors and impacted each  of our geographic segments. Productivity improvements were adversely impacted by ongoing costs related to supply chain  constraints. The favorable mix was driven by changes in the proportion of products sold from each of our product categories. During fiscal 2021, we continued to manage through supply chain challenges seen industry wide due to component shortages,  caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges resulted in increased costs (i.e. component costs, broker fees,  expedited freight and overtime) which had a negative impact on product gross margin, and extended lead times to us and Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.

We do not allocate these items to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include such  information in measuring the performance of the operating segments. Amounts may not sum and percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. We experienced a gross margin percentage increase in our Americas segment due to favorable product mix and productivity  improvements, partially offset by pricing erosion. Gross margin in our EMEA segment decreased due to pricing erosion, partially offset by productivity improvements and, to  a lesser extent, favorable product mix. Lower service gross margin also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin in this  geographic segment. The APJC segment gross margin percentage increase was due to productivity improvements and favorable product mix, partially  offset by pricing erosion. The gross margin percentage for a particular segment may fluctuate, and period-to-period changes in such percentages may or  may not be indicative of a trend for that segment. our customers. We have partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply  coverage, including revising supplier arrangements, to address supply chain challenges. We believe these actions will enable us  to optimize our access to critical components, including semiconductors. We expect these supply chain challenges to continue  through at least the first half of fiscal 2022 and potentially into the second half of fiscal 2022. Productivity improvements were driven by memory cost savings and other cost reductions including value engineering efforts  (e.g. component redesign, board configuration, test processes and transformation processes) and continued operational  efficiency in manufacturing operations. Our service gross margin percentage decreased by 0.3 percentage points primarily due to higher headcount-related and delivery  costs, partially offset by higher sales volume and to a lesser extent, favorable mix of service offerings. Our service gross margin normally experiences some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations  in our renewals, our strategic investments in headcount, and the resources we deploy to support the overall service business.  Other factors include the mix of service offerings, as the gross margin from our advanced services is typically lower than the  gross margin from technical support services.

The extra week in fiscal 2021 contributed to the increase in headcount- related expenses in our R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses. R&D expenses increased due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher share-based compensation expense, higher  acquisition-related costs and higher contracted services spending, partially offset by lower discretionary spending. We continue to invest in R&D in order to bring a broad range of products to market in a timely fashion. If we believe that we  are unable to enter a particular market in a timely manner with internally developed products, we may purchase or license  technology from other businesses, or we may partner with or acquire businesses as an alternative to internal R&D. Sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount-related expenses, higher contracted services spending  and higher share-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower discretionary spending. G&A expenses increased due to the impact from the gain recognized on the sale of property in fiscal 2020 and higher headcount- related expenses. In fiscal 2021, foreign currency fluctuations, net of hedging, increased the combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A  expenses by approximately $214 million, or 1.2%, compared with fiscal 2020.

(434) (585) (859) 151 In the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we initiated a restructuring plan, which included a voluntary early retirement program, in  order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. The total pretax charges are estimated to be  approximately $900 million. In connection with this restructuring plan, we incurred charges of $881 million during fiscal 2021.  We substantially completed the Fiscal 2021 Plan in fiscal 2021 and do not expect any remaining charges related to this plan to  be material. We estimate the Fiscal 2021 Plan will generate cost savings of approximately $1.0 billion on an annualized basis. We incurred total restructuring and other charges of $886 million in fiscal 2021. We incurred charges of $881 million related to  the restructuring plan initiated during fiscal 2021 and the remainder of which was related to the restructuring plan announced  during fiscal 2020.

The change in net gains (losses) on marketable equity  investments was attributable to market value fluctuations and the timing of recognition of gains and losses. The change in net  gains (losses) on privately held investments was primarily due to higher net unrealized gains and lower impairment charges,  partially offset by lower realized gains. The change in other gains (losses), net was primarily driven by lower donation expense  and favorable impacts from our equity derivatives, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange. The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 20.1% for fiscal 2021, compared with 19.7% for fiscal 2020.  The net 0.4 percentage points increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in the tax benefit from foreign  income taxed at other than U.S. rates, offset by an increase in foreign-derived intangible income deduction and a decrease in  state taxes.

These uses of cash were partially offset by  cash provided by operating activities of $15.5 billion. In addition to cash requirements in the normal course of business, we have approximately $0.7 billion of the U.S. transition  tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries and $2.5 billion of long-term debt outstanding at July 31, 2021 that will  mature within the next 12 months from the balance sheet date. See further discussion of liquidity and future payments under  “Contractual Obligations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements” below. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. We classify our investments as short-term  investments based on their nature and their availability for use in current operations. We believe the overall credit quality of our  portfolio is strong, with our cash equivalents and our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio consisting primarily of high  quality investment-grade securities. We believe that our strong cash and cash equivalents and investments position is critical at  this time of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic and allows us to use our cash resources for strategic investments to gain  access to new technologies, for acquisitions, for customer financing activities, for working capital needs, and for the repurchase  of shares of common stock and payment of dividends as discussed below. Securities Lending We periodically engage in securities lending activities with certain of our available-for-sale debt investments.  These transactions are accounted for as a secured lending of the securities, and the securities are typically loaned only on  an overnight basis. We require collateral equal to at least 102% of the fair market value of the loaned security and that the  collateral be in the form of cash or liquid, high-quality assets. We engage in these secured lending transactions only with highly  creditworthy counterparties, and the associated portfolio custodian has agreed to indemnify us against collateral losses. We did  not experience any losses in connection with the secured lending of securities during the periods presented. Free Cash Flow and Capital Allocation As part of our capital allocation strategy, we intend to return a minimum of 50% of our  free cash flow annually to our stockholders through cash dividends and repurchases of common stock. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used to acquire property and equipment. The  following table reconciles our net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions): Acquisition of property and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We further regard free cash flow as a useful measure because it reflects cash that can be used to, among other things, invest in  our business, make strategic acquisitions, repurchase common stock, and pay dividends on our common stock, after deducting  capital investments. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance and liquidity is that  the free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the period. In addition, we have  other required uses of cash, including repaying the principal of our outstanding indebtedness. Free cash flow is not a measure  calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and should not be regarded in isolation or as an  alternative for net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with such principles, and  other companies may calculate free cash flow in a different manner than we do.

Inventory Supply Chain The following table summarizes our inventories (in millions): Inventory as of July 31, 2021 increased by 22% from our inventory balance at the end of fiscal 2020. The increase in inventory  was primarily due to an increase in raw materials, partially offset by a decrease in finished goods. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services  for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate  component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory  based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements and our commitment to securing  manufacturing capacity. Our purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers  to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of our purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to  arrangements to secure long-term supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant  portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional  commitments. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements  based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We believe our inventory and purchase commitments are in line  with our current demand forecasts. Any future dividends are subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The remaining authorized amount for stock repurchases under this program is approximately $7.9 billion, with no termination  date.

Lease receivables  include sales-type leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying  assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may  include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We  also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support  services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period  during which the services are performed. Financing receivables decreased by 14%. Financing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers  and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related  to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these  lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided  by third parties, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements  result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify  as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. The volume of channel partner financing was $26.7 billion, $26.9 billion, and $29.6 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019,  respectively. These financing arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and in some  cases, we guarantee a portion of these arrangements. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was  $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively. We could be called upon to make payments under  these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Historically, our payments under  these arrangements have been immaterial. Where we provide a guarantee, we defer the revenue associated with the channel  partner and end-user financing arrangement in accordance with revenue recognition policies, or we record a liability for the fair  value of the guarantees. In either case, the deferred revenue is recognized as revenue when the guarantee is removed. As of July  31, 2021, the total maximum potential future payments related to these guarantees was approximately $160 million, of which  approximately $21 million was recorded as deferred revenue. 1 to 3 years. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,806 412 3 to 5 years. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,545 — The increase in purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers compared with the end of fiscal 2020 was  due to arrangements to secure long-term supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. We have  partnered with several of our key suppliers utilizing our volume purchasing and extending supply coverage, including revising  supplier arrangements, to address supply chain challenges. Inventory and supply chain management remain areas of focus as we balance the need to maintain supply chain flexibility to  help ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer  requirements.

Our $2.0 billion senior fixed-rate notes with a maturity date of September 20, 2021 were redeemed on August 20, 2021, pursuant  to our par call redemption option. The redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid  interest to, but excluding, August 20, 2021. Commercial Paper We have a short-term debt financing program in which up to $10.0 billion is available through the issuance  of commercial paper notes. We use the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes.  We had no commercial paper outstanding as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020. Credit Facility On May 13, 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a  $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 13, 2026. The credit agreement is structured  as an amendment and restatement of our 364-day credit agreement which would have terminated on May 14, 2021. As of July  31, 2021, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any  funds under the credit agreement. Any advances under the 5-year credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal  to, based on certain conditions, either (a) with respect to loans in U.S. dollars, (i) LIBOR or (ii) the Base Rate (to be defined as  the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) a daily rate equal to one-month  LIBOR plus 1.0%), (b) with respect to loans in Euros, EURIBOR, (c) with respect to loans in Yen, TIBOR and (d) with respect  to loans in Pounds Sterling, SONIA plus a credit spread adjustment, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings  as published by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will  the interest rate be less than 0.0%. We will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement  which may vary depending on our senior debt credit ratings. In addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain  sustainability-linked metrics. Specifically, our applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward  adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve, certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social  impact and (ii) foam reduction. We may also, upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not  currently parties to the agreement, increase the commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and,  at our option, extend the maturity of the facility for an additional year up to two times. The credit agreement requires that we  comply with certain covenants, including that we maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. 5.50%  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers  and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. Our purchase commitments are  for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity.

The increase in deferred product revenue of 19% was primarily due to  increased deferrals related to our recurring software offerings. The increase in deferred service revenue was driven by the  impact of contract renewals, partially offset by amortization of deferred service revenue. The impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction  with the factors that impact our cash flows from operations discussed previously. In addition, we plan for and measure our  liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations  at July 31, 2021 (in millions): Total remaining performance obligations increased 9% in fiscal 2021. Remaining performance obligations for product and  service increased 18% and 3%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2020.

We record a liability for  firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent  with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in “Inventory Supply Chain.” Other Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary  course of business, other than operating leases and commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers, for which we  have not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our  authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations. Long-Term Debt The amount of long-term debt in the preceding table represents the principal amount of the respective debt  instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Transition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition  tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”). See Note 18 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements. Other Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities  for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of  future payments, our noncurrent income taxes payable of approximately $2.4 billion and deferred tax liabilities of $134 million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes  payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of  certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain  employees of the acquired entities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments, some of which may be based  on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are required to be funded on demand. The funding  commitments were $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively. We consider our investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities to be off-balance sheet arrangements. In the ordinary  course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments  are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer  financings, and we have determined that as of July 31, 2021 there were no material unconsolidated variable interest entities. On an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable  interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a  result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we  may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events. We provide financing guarantees, which are generally for various third-party financing arrangements extended to our channel  partners and end-user customers. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment  by the channel partners or end-user customers. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under “Financing  Receivables and Guarantees.” While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased  disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. The pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely  affect our liquidity and capital resources in the future. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe our cash  and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit  lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically, including the  following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual  obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other  liquidity requirements associated with our operations. There are no other transactions, arrangements, or relationships with  unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect the liquidity and the availability of, as well  as our requirements for, capital resources. Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Our financial position is exposed to a variety of risks, including interest rate risk, equity price risk, and foreign currency  exchange risk. We have seen an increase in these risks and related uncertainties with increased volatility in the financial markets  in the current environment with the COVID-19 pandemic. Available-for-Sale Debt Investments We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Our  primary objective for holding available-for-sale debt investments is to achieve an appropriate investment return consistent  with preserving principal and managing risk. At any time, a sharp rise in market interest rates could have a material adverse  impact on the fair value of our available-for-sale debt investment portfolio. Conversely, declines in interest rates as has also  happened recently, including the impact from lower credit spreads, could have a material adverse impact on interest income for  our investment portfolio. We may utilize derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments to achieve our investment  objectives. We had no outstanding hedging instruments for our available-for-sale debt investments as of July 31, 2021. Our  available-for-sale debt investments are held for purposes other than trading. Our available-for-sale debt investments are not  leveraged as of July 31, 2021. We monitor our interest rate and credit risks, including our credit exposures to specific rating  categories and to individual issuers. We believe the overall credit quality of our portfolio is strong. The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our available-for-sale debt investments, including the hedging effects  when applicable, as a result of selected potential market decreases and increases in interest rates. The market changes reflect  immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus 50 basis points (BPS), plus 100 BPS, and plus 150 BPS.  The hypothetical fair values as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020 are as follows (in millions): Available-for-sale debt investments . . .  $15,537 $15,427 $15,317 $15,206 $15,096 $14,986 $14,875 Available-for-sale debt investments . . .  $17,877 $17,788 $17,699 $17,610 $17,522 $17,433 $17,344 Financing Receivables As of July 31, 2021, our financing receivables had a carrying value of $9.3 billion, compared with $10.8  billion as of July 25, 2020. As of July 31, 2021, a hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change  the fair value of our financing receivables by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.1 billion, respectively. Debt As of July 31, 2021, we had $11.5 billion in principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes outstanding. The carrying amount  of the senior notes was $11.5 billion, and the related fair value based on market prices was $13.7 billion. As of July 31, 2021, a  hypothetical 50 BPS increase or decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the fixed-rate debt, excluding  the $2.0 billion of hedged debt, by a decrease or increase of approximately $0.4 billion, respectively. However, this hypothetical  change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed-rate debt that is not hedged. Marketable Equity Investments The fair value of our marketable equity investments is subject to market price volatility. We  hold equity securities for strategic purposes or to diversify our overall investment portfolio. These equity securities are held  for purposes other than trading. As of July 31, 2021, the total fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities was  $137 million. We had no outstanding marketable equity securities as of July 25, 2020. Privately Held Investments These investments are recorded in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of July 31,  2021, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held investments was $1.5 billion, compared with $1.3 billion  at July 25, 2020. Some of these companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments  are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the  early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of privately  held investments is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their  technologies and potential for financial return. At July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, we had no option contracts outstanding. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. The direct effect of foreign currency fluctuations on revenue has not  been material because our revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to  other currencies, such strengthening could have an indirect effect on our revenue to the extent it raises the cost of our products  to non-U.S. customers and thereby reduces demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. However, the precise  indirect effect of currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our revenue is influenced by many factors in  addition to the impact of such currency fluctuations. Approximately 70% of our operating expenses are U.S.-dollar denominated. In fiscal 2021, foreign currency fluctuations, net  of hedging, increased our combined R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses by approximately $214 million, or 1.2%,  as compared with fiscal 2020. To reduce variability in operating expenses and service cost of sales caused by non-U.S.-dollar  denominated operating expenses and costs, we may hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions with currency options  and forward contracts. These hedging programs are not designed to provide foreign currency protection over long time horizons.  In designing a specific hedging approach, we consider several factors, including offsetting exposures, significance of exposures,  costs associated with entering into a particular hedge instrument, and potential effectiveness of the hedge. The gains and losses  on foreign exchange contracts mitigate the effect of currency movements on our operating expenses and service cost of sales. We also enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations  on receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities. The market  risks associated with these foreign currency receivables and payables relate primarily to variances from our forecasted foreign  currency transactions and balances. We do not enter into foreign exchange forward or option contracts for speculative purposes. Our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at fiscal year-end are summarized in U.S. dollar equivalents as follows  (in millions): Sold. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 1,698 $ 12 $ 1,874 $ 4 Purchased. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 2,441 $ (14) $ 2,441 $ 1 Item 8.

Our available-for-sale debt investments primarily consist of U.S. government, U.S. government agency, corporate  debt, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities. These available-for-sale debt investments are primarily held in the custody  of a major financial institution. A specific identification method is used to determine the cost basis of available-for-sale debt  investments sold. These investments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses  on these investments are included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax. We  classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations. The fiscal year for Cisco Systems, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cisco,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the  last Saturday in July. Fiscal 2021 was a 53-week fiscal year, and each of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 were 52-week fiscal years.  The Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts and those of our subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and  transactions have been eliminated. We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis in the  following three geographic segments: the Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan, and  China (APJC). At our annual meeting of shareholders held on December 10, 2020, shareholders voted to approve changing our state of  incorporation from California to Delaware. The reincorporation became effective January 25, 2021. Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting  models. The noncontrolling interests attributed to these investments, if any, are presented as a separate component from our  equity in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The share of earnings attributable to the noncontrolling  interests are not presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as these amounts are not material for any of  the fiscal periods presented. Certain reclassifications have been made to the amounts for prior years in order to conform to the current year’s presentation.  We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were issued. 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (c) Equity Instruments Our equity investments are accounted for as follows: 1.  Basis of Presentation ▪ Marketable equity securities have readily determinable fair value (RDFV) that are measured and recorded at fair value  through income. ▪ Non-marketable equity securities do not have RDFV and are measured using a measurement alternative recorded at cost  less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. For certain of these  securities, we have elected to apply the net asset value (NAV) practical expedient. The NAV is the estimated fair value  of these investments. ▪ Equity method investments are securities we do not control, but are able to exert significant influence over the investee.  These investments are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee  income or loss. (d) Impairments of Investments For our available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether  a credit loss exists. In this assessment, among other factors, we consider the extent to which the fair value is less than the  amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the  security. If factors indicate a credit loss exists, an allowance for credit loss is recorded to other income (loss), net, limited by the  amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. The amount of fair value change relating to all other factors will  be recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). We hold non-marketable equity and other investments (“privately held investments”) which are included in other assets in  the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We monitor these investments for impairments and make reductions in carrying values if  we determine that an impairment charge is required based primarily on the financial condition and near-term prospects of  these companies. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements CISCO SYSTEMS, INC. (e) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost,  which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. We provide inventory write-downs based on excess and obsolete  inventories determined primarily by future demand forecasts. The write-down is measured as the difference between the cost  of the inventory and market based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory, which is  a component of cost of sales. At the point of the loss recognition, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established, and  subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. In  addition, we record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and  suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. (f) Allowance for Accounts Receivable, Contract Assets and Financing Receivables We estimate our allowances for credit  losses using relevant available information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions and  reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit  losses. When assessing for credit losses, we determine collectibility by pooling our assets with similar characteristics. The allowances for credit losses are each measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Our internal  credit risk ratings are categorized as 1 through 10, with the lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality. Our assets  within each internal credit risk rating share similar risk characteristics and therefore are assessed as one portfolio segment for  credit loss. Assets that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. The allowances for credit losses  are each measured by multiplying the exposure probability of default, the probability the asset will default within a given time  frame, by the loss given default rate, the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default, based on the pool  of assets. Probability of default rates are published quarterly by third-party credit agencies. Adjustments to our internal credit risk  ratings may take into account including, but not limited to, various customer-specific factors, the potential sovereign risk of the  geographic locations in which the customer is operating and macroeconomic conditions. These factors are updated regularly or  when facts and circumstances indicate that an update is deemed necessary. (g) Financing Receivables and Guarantees We provide financing arrangements, including leases, financed service contracts,  and loans, for certain qualified end-user customers to build, maintain, and upgrade their networks. Lease receivables primarily  represent sales-type and direct-financing leases. Leases have on average a four-year term and are usually collateralized by a  security interest in the underlying assets. Loan receivables include customers financing purchases of our hardware, software  and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our  products and services. Loan receivables have terms of three years on average. Financed service contracts typically have terms  of one year to three years and primarily relate to technical support services. Outstanding financing receivables that are aged 31 days or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due. We  do not accrue interest on financing receivables that are considered impaired or more than 120 days past due unless either the  receivable has not been collected due to administrative reasons or the receivable is well secured and in the process of collection.  Financing receivables may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if, in management’s opinion, a timely collection of the full  principal and interest becomes uncertain. After a financing receivable has been categorized as nonaccrual, interest will be  recognized when cash is received. A financing receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer’s  delinquent balances of principal and interest have been settled, and the customer remains current for an appropriate period. We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners, consisting of revolving short-term financing,  generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer  of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales,  and we receive a payment for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms. These financing  arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion  of these arrangements. We also provide financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end-user  customers related to leases and loans, which typically have terms of up to three years. We could be called upon to make  payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners or end-user customers. Deferred revenue  relating to these financing arrangements is recorded in accordance with revenue recognition policies or for the fair value of the  financing guarantees. (h) Leases We lease real estate, information technology (IT) and other equipment and vehicles. We also have arrangements  with certain suppliers and contract manufacturers which includes the leasing of dedicated space and equipment costs. Our leases  have the option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. As a lessee, we determine if an arrangement is a lease at commencement. Our ROU lease assets represent our right to use an  underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments related to the lease.  Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments  over the lease term. We use incremental borrowing rates based on information available at the commencement date to determine  the present value of our lease payments. Certain of our lease agreements contain variable lease payments. Our variable lease  payments can fluctuate depending on the level of activity or the cost of certain services where we have elected to combine lease  and non-lease components. While these payments are not included as part of our lease liabilities, they are recognized as variable  lease expense in the period they are incurred. We provide leasing of our equipment and complementary third-party products primarily through our channel partners and  distributors, for which the income arising from these leases is recognized through interest income. As a lessor, we determine if  an arrangement is a lease at inception. We provide leasing arrangements for our equipment to certain qualified customers. Our  lease portfolio primarily consists of sales-type leases. We allocate the consideration in a bundled contract with our customers  based on relative standalone selling prices of our lease and non-lease components. The residual value on our leased equipment  is determined at the inception of the lease based on an analysis of estimates of the value of equipment, market factors and  historical customer behavior. Residual value estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and other-than-temporary declines are  expensed in the period they occur. Our leases generally provide an end-of-term option for the customer to extend the lease  under mutually-agreed terms, return the leased equipment, or purchase the equipment for either the then-market value of the  equipment or a pre-determined purchase price. If a customer chooses to terminate their lease prior to the original end of term  date, the customer is required to pay all remaining lease payments in full. We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842 at the beginning of fiscal 2020 and applied it at the beginning of the  period of adoption and did not restate prior periods. For additional information, see Note 8. (i) Depreciation and Amortization Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation or amortization,  whenever applicable. Depreciation and amortization expenses for property and equipment were approximately $0.8 billion, $0.9  billion, and $1.0 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the  straight-line method, generally over the following periods: Asset Category Period Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25 years Building improvements  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years Leasehold improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is  recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for  impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible  asset and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are  recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. (k) Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter  and, when specific circumstances dictate, between annual tests. When impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down  to fair value. Identifying a potential impairment consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying  amount, including goodwill. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization.  Amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. See “Long-Lived Assets” for our policy  regarding impairment testing of purchased intangible assets with finite lives. Purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives  are assessed for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts might  be impaired. (l) Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets that are held and used by us are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Determination of recoverability  of long-lived assets is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its  eventual disposition. Measurement of an impairment loss for long-lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported  at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. (m) Fair Value Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in  an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements  for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value, we consider the principal or most  advantageous market in which we would transact, and we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when  pricing the asset or liability. The accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize  the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level  of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization  within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or  liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities  in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which  significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. We use inputs  such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data, which are obtained from quoted  market prices, independent pricing vendors, or other sources, to determine the ultimate fair value of assets or liabilities. Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant  to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The fair values are determined based on model-based techniques  such as discounted cash flow models using inputs that we could not corroborate with market data. (n) Derivative Instruments We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments  at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the  resulting designation. For a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the  period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged. For a derivative  instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss is initially reported as a component of AOCI and subsequently  reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. For a derivative instrument designated as a net investment  hedge of our foreign operations, the gain or loss is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within AOCI together with  the offsetting loss or gain of the hedged exposure of the underlying foreign operations. For derivative instruments that are not  designated as accounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change. We record derivative  instruments in the statements of cash flows to operating, investing, or financing activities consistent with the cash flows of the  hedged item. Hedge effectiveness for foreign exchange forward contracts used as cash flow hedges is assessed by comparing the change in  the fair value of the hedge contract with the change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge  effectiveness for equity forward contracts and foreign exchange net investment hedge forward contracts is assessed by comparing  changes in fair value due to changes in spot rates for both the derivative and the hedged item. For foreign exchange option  contracts, hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the hedging instrument’s entire change in fair value. Hedge effectiveness for  interest rate swaps is assessed by comparing the change in fair value of the swap with the change in the fair value of the hedged  item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. (o) Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment,  where that local currency is the functional currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance  sheet date, with the resulting translation adjustments directly recorded to a separate component of AOCI. Income and expense  accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. Remeasurement adjustments are recorded in other income  (loss), net. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents was not material for any of the fiscal  years presented. (p) Concentrations of Risk Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions. Deposits held  with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed  upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We  seek to mitigate our credit risks by spreading such risks across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profiles of  these counterparties. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and, with the exception of certain financing transactions, do not require  collateral from our customers. We receive certain of our components from sole suppliers. Additionally, we rely on a limited  number of contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide manufacturing services for our products. The inability of a contract  manufacturer or supplier to fulfill our supply requirements could materially impact future operating results. (q) Revenue Recognition We enter into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and  services which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. As a result, our contracts may  contain multiple performance obligations. We determine whether arrangements are distinct based on whether the customer  can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and whether our  commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the contract.  We classify our hardware, perpetual software licenses, and SaaS as distinct performance obligations. Term software licenses  represent multiple obligations, which include software licenses and software maintenance. In transactions where we deliver  hardware or software, we are typically the principal and we record revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis. We refer to  our term software licenses, security software licenses, SaaS, and associated service arrangements as subscription offers. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised goods or services in a contract with a customer in an amount that  reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Transfer of control occurs once  the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment, electronic delivery (or when the software  is available for download by the customer), or once title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. Transfer of control  can also occur over time for software maintenance and services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term.  Our hardware and perpetual software licenses are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon  transfer of control. Term software licenses include multiple performance obligations where the term licenses are recognized  upfront upon transfer of control, with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term as  services and software updates are provided. SaaS arrangements do not include the right for the customer to take possession of  the software during the term, and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue  recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer consumes the services. On our product sales, we record consideration  from shipping and handling on a gross basis within net product sales. We record our revenue net of any associated sales taxes. An allowance for future sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates. The allowance for future  sales returns as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020 was $55 million and $79 million, respectively, and was recorded as a reduction  of our accounts receivable and revenue. Revenue is allocated among these performance obligations in a manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled  to for the promised goods or services based on standalone selling prices (SSP). SSP is estimated for each distinct performance  obligation and judgment may be required in their determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product  or service when we sell the goods separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not  directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We assess relevant contractual terms in our customer contracts to determine the transaction price. We apply judgment in  identifying contractual terms and determining the transaction price as we may be required to estimate variable consideration  when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration includes potential contractual penalties and  various rebate, cooperative marketing and other incentive programs that we offer to our distributors, channel partners and  customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, we estimate the expected usage of these programs, applying  the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes  available. We also consider the customers’ right of return in determining the transaction price, where applicable. We assess certain software licenses, such as for security software, that contain critical updates or upgrades which customers can  download throughout the contract term. Without these updates or upgrades, the functionality of the software would diminish over  a relatively short time period. These updates or upgrades provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased security  software licenses and are required to maintain the security license’s utility as the risks and threats in the environment are  rapidly changing. In these circumstances, the revenue from these software arrangements is recognized as a single performance  obligation satisfied over the contract term. We adopted ASC 606 at the beginning of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method to those contracts that were not  completed as of July 28, 2018. For the additional information, see Note 3. (r) Advertising Costs We expense all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs included within sales and marketing  expenses were approximately $268 million, $187 million, and $204 million for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. (s) Share-Based Compensation Expense We measure and recognize the compensation expense for all share-based awards  made to employees and directors, including employee stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance-based restricted  stock units (PRSUs), and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Employee Stock Purchase  Rights) based on estimated fair values. The fair value of employee stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-  binomial option-pricing model (Lattice-Binomial Model) or the Black-Scholes model, and for employee stock purchase rights  we estimate the fair value using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value for time-based stock awards and stock awards that are  contingent upon the achievement of financial performance metrics is based on the grant date share price reduced by the present  value of the expected dividend yield prior to vesting. The fair value of market-based stock awards is estimated using an option-  pricing model on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense is reduced for forfeitures. (t) Software Development Costs Software development costs, including costs to develop software sold, leased, or otherwise  marketed, that are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized if significant. Costs  incurred during the application development stage for internal-use software are capitalized if significant. Capitalized software  development costs are amortized using the straight-line amortization method over the estimated useful life of the applicable  software. Such software development costs required to be capitalized have not been material to date. (u) Income Taxes Income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are  recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their  reported amounts. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not  be realized. We account for uncertainty in income taxes using a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions.  The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is  more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes,  if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon  settlement. We classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that we anticipate payment (or receipt)  of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the provision for income taxes. (v) Computation of Net Income per Share Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of  common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number  of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted shares outstanding includes the  dilutive effect of in-the-money options, unvested restricted stock, and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of such equity  awards is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury  stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and the amount of compensation cost for future  service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. (w) Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities Our approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for variable interest  entities focuses on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable  interest entity’s economic performance and which enterprise has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits  from the variable interest entity. Should we conclude that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, the assets,  liabilities, and results of operations of the variable interest entity will be included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. (x) Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles  generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported  in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for the following, among others: The inputs into certain of our judgments, assumptions, and estimates considered the economic implications of the COVID-19  pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimates. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially from  our estimates. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, many of our estimates could require increased judgment and carry a  higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve our estimates may change materially in future periods. Credit Losses of Financial Instruments In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires measurement  and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held based on historical experience, current conditions, and  reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. We adopted this standard at the  beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2021, applied it at the beginning of the period of adoption and did not restate prior periods.  The standard primarily impacts our financial assets measured at amortized cost and available-for-sale debt securities. The  standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued an accounting standard update and subsequent amendments that  provide optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modification and hedging relationships to ease  the financial reporting burden of the expected market transition from the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other  interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. This accounting standard update was effective upon issuance and may be  applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update  on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.  Revenue (a)  Disaggregation of Revenue We disaggregate our revenue into groups of similar products and services that depict the nature, amount, and timing of revenue  and cash flows for our various offerings. The sales cycle, contractual obligations, customer requirements, and go-to-market  strategies differ for each of our product categories, resulting in different economic risk profiles for each category. Amounts may not sum due to rounding. We have made certain reclassifications to the product revenue amounts for prior years  to conform to the current year’s presentation. (1) During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we completed the divestiture of the Service Provider Video Software Solutions (SPVSS)  business. Total revenue includes SPVSS business revenue of $168 million for fiscal 2019. Infrastructure Platforms consist of our core networking technologies of switching, routing, wireless, and data center products  that are designed to work together to deliver networking capabilities and transport and/or store data. These technologies consist  of both hardware and software offerings, including software licenses and software-as-a-service (SaaS), that help our customers  build networks, automate, orchestrate, integrate, and digitize data. We are shifting and expanding more of our business to  software and subscriptions across our core networking portfolio. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are  distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. Term software licenses are  multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated  software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. SaaS arrangements in this category have one distinct  performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Applications consists of offerings that utilize the core networking and data center platforms to provide their functions. The  products consist primarily of software offerings, including software licenses and SaaS, as well as hardware. Our perpetual  software and hardware in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of  control. Term software licenses are multiple performance obligations where the term license is recognized upfront upon transfer  of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term.

Updates and upgrades for the term software licenses are critical for our software to perform its  intended commercial purpose because of the continuous need for our software to secure our customers’ network environments  against frequent threats. Therefore, security software licenses are generally represented by a single distinct performance  obligation with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Our hardware and perpetual software in this category are  distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control. SaaS arrangements in this  category have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the  contract term. Other Products primarily includes our emerging technologies products. These products include both hardware and software  licenses. Our offerings in this category are distinct performance obligations where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer  of control. In addition to our product offerings, we provide a broad range of service and support options for our customers, including  technical support services and advanced services. Technical support services represent the majority of these offerings which are  distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term. Advanced  services are distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time with revenue recognized as services are delivered. The sales arrangements as discussed above are typically made pursuant to customer purchase orders based on master purchase  or partner agreements. Cash is received based on our standard payment terms which is typically 30 days. We provide financing  arrangements to customers for all of our hardware, software and service offerings. Refer to Note 9 for additional information.  For these arrangements, cash is typically received over time. Accounts receivable, net was $5.8 billion as of July 31, 2021 compared to $5.5 billion as of July 25, 2020, as reported on the  Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract assets consist of unbilled receivables and are recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of scheduled billings to  our customers. These amounts are primarily related to software and service arrangements where transfer of control has occurred  but we have not yet invoiced. As of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, our contract assets for these unbilled receivables, net of  allowances, were $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets. 1 to 4  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  $ 521 5 to 6  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   770 7 and Higher  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   166 Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Deferred revenue was $22.2 billion as of July 31, 2021 compared to $20.4 billion  as of July 25, 2020. We recognized approximately $11.3 billion of revenue during fiscal 2021 that was included in the deferred  revenue balance at July 25, 2020. We capitalize direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire contracts, primarily sales commissions, for which the associated  revenue is expected to be recognized in future periods. We incur these costs in connection with both initial contracts and  renewals. These costs are initially deferred and typically amortized over the term of the customer contract which corresponds  to the period of benefit. Deferred sales commissions were $967 million and $732 million as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020,  respectively, and were included in other current assets and other assets. The amortization expense associated with these costs  was $532 million and $477 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was included in sales and marketing expenses.

In connection with the Fiscal 2021 Plan, we incurred charges of $881 million during fiscal  2021. We substantially completed the Fiscal 2021 Plan in fiscal 2021 and do not expect any remaining charges related to this  plan to be material. We initiated a restructuring plan during fiscal 2020 (the “Fiscal 2020 Plan”) in order to realign the organization and enable  further investment in key priority areas, with estimated pretax charges of approximately $300 million. In connection with the  Fiscal 2020 Plan, we incurred cumulative charges of $260 million. We completed the Fiscal 2020 Plan in fiscal 2021. In prior years, we initiated restructuring plans in order to realign our organization and enable further investment in key priority  areas.

We provide leasing of our equipment and  complementary third-party products primarily through our channel partners and distributors, for which the income arising from  these leases is recognized through interest income. Interest income for fiscal 2021 and 2020 was $75 million and $94 million,  respectively, and was included in interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The net investment of our lease  receivables is measured at the commencement date as the gross lease receivable, residual value less unearned income and  allowance for credit loss.

Financing Receivables  (a) Financing Receivables Financing receivables primarily consist of lease receivables, loan receivables, and financed service contracts. Lease receivables  represent sales-type leases resulting from the sale of Cisco’s and complementary third-party products and are typically  collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years  on average. Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services, which  may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services.  Loan receivables have terms of three years on average. Financed service contracts include financing receivables related to  technical support and advanced services. Revenue related to the technical support services is typically deferred and included in  deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed, which  typically ranges from one year to three years.

We recognized a net unrealized gain during fiscal 2021 on our marketable securities still held as of the reporting date of  $8 million. Our net adjustments to non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative still held was  a net gain of $39 million and a net loss of $13 million for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. We held equity interests in certain  private equity funds of $0.9 billion and $0.7 billion as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively, which are accounted for  under the NAV practical expedient. In the ordinary course of business, we have investments in privately held companies and provide financing to certain customers.  These privately held companies and customers are evaluated for consolidation under the variable interest or voting interest  entity models. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our investments in these privately held companies and our customer financings,  and have determined that as of July 31, 2021, there were no significant variable interest or voting interest entities required to be  consolidated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. As of July 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies was $1.5 billion. Of the total carrying  value of our investments in privately held companies as of July 31, 2021, $0.9 billion of such investments are considered to be  in variable interest entities which are unconsolidated. We have total funding commitments of $0.2 billion related to privately  held investments, some of which may be based on the achievement of certain agreed-upon milestones, and some of which are  required to be funded on demand. The carrying value of these investments and the additional funding commitments collectively  represent our maximum exposure related to privately held investments.

Fair Value (a) Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions): Level 1 marketable securities are determined by using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 available- for-sale debt investments are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding market prices that are  corroborated by observable market data. Our derivative instruments are primarily classified as Level 2, as they are not actively  traded and are valued using pricing models that use observable market inputs. We did not have any transfers between Level 1 and  Level 2 fair value measurements during the periods presented. Level 3 assets include certain derivative instruments, the values  of which are determined based on discounted cash flow models using inputs that we could not corroborate with market data. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities measured using the measurement alternative recorded to fair  value on a non-recurring basis is adjusted for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer  or impairment. These securities are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on  valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs such as volatility,  rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of our short-term loan receivables and financed service contracts approximates their carrying value due to  their short duration. The aggregate carrying value of our long-term loan receivables and financed service contracts as of  July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020 was $4.0 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively.

As of July 31, 2021, the fair value of our senior notes was $13.7 billion, with a carrying amount of $11.5 billion.  This compares to a fair value of $17.4 billion and a carrying amount of $14.6 billion as of July 25, 2020. The fair value of the  senior notes was determined based on observable market prices in a less active market and was categorized as Level 2 in the  fair value hierarchy.

These swaps convert the fixed interest rates of the fixed-rate notes to  floating interest rates based on the LIBOR. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps  substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in  market interest rates. For additional information, see Note 13. Interest is payable semiannually on each class of the senior fixed-rate notes. Each of the senior fixed-rate notes is redeemable  by us at any time, subject to a make-whole premium. The senior notes rank at par with the commercial paper notes that may be  issued in the future pursuant to our short-term debt financing program, as discussed above under “(a) Short-Term Debt.” As of  July 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all debt covenants.

The redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid  interest to, but excluding, August 20, 2021. On May 13, 2021, we entered into a 5-year credit agreement with certain institutional lenders that provides for a $3.0 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility that is scheduled to expire on May 13, 2026. The credit agreement is structured as an  amendment and restatement of our 364-day credit agreement, which would have terminated on May 14, 2021. As of July 31,  2021, we were in compliance with the required interest coverage ratio and the other covenants, and we had not borrowed any  funds under the credit agreement. Any advances under the 5-year credit agreement will accrue interest at rates that are equal to, based on certain conditions, either  (a) with respect to loans in U.S. dollars, (i) LIBOR or (ii) the Base Rate (to be defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America  prime rate, (y) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) a daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 1.0%), (b) with respect to  loans in Euros, EURIBOR, (c) with respect to loans in Yen, TIBOR and (d) with respect to loans in Pounds Sterling, SONIA  plus a credit spread adjustment, plus a margin that is based on our senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor’s  Financial Services, LLC and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., provided that in no event will the interest rate be less than 0.0%.  We will pay a quarterly commitment fee during the term of the 5-year credit agreement which may vary depending on our senior  debt credit ratings. In addition, the 5-year credit agreement incorporates certain sustainability-linked metrics. Specifically, our  applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments if we achieve, or fail to achieve,  certain specified targets based on two key performance indicator metrics: (i) social impact and (ii) foam reduction. We may also,  upon the agreement of either the then-existing lenders or additional lenders not currently parties to the agreement, increase the  commitments under the credit facility by up to an additional $2.0 billion and, at our option, extend the maturity of the facility  for an additional year up to two times. The credit agreement requires that we comply with certain covenants, including that we  maintain an interest coverage ratio as defined in the agreement.

Derivative Instruments (a)  Summary of Derivative Instruments We use derivative instruments primarily to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price  risks. Our primary objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes  in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity prices. Our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that  the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. We do, however, seek to mitigate such risks by limiting  our counterparties to major financial institutions and requiring collateral in certain cases. In addition, the potential risk of loss  with any one counterparty resulting from this type of credit risk is monitored. Management does not expect material losses as  a result of defaults by counterparties.

However, our master netting  and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are  designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. As of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, the  potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the derivative contracts would be a reduction to both derivative assets  and derivative liabilities of $17 million and $10 million, respectively. To further limit credit risk, we also enter into collateral security arrangements related to certain derivative instruments whereby  cash is posted as collateral between the counterparties based on the fair market value of the derivative instrument. Under these  collateral security arrangements, the net cash collateral received as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020 was $109 million and $173  million, respectively. Including the effects of collateral, this results in a net derivative liability of $3 million and a net derivative  asset of $8 million as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively. We conduct business globally in numerous currencies. Therefore, we are exposed to adverse movements in foreign currency  exchange rates. To limit the exposure related to foreign currency changes, we enter into foreign currency contracts. We do not  enter into such contracts for speculative purposes. We hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions related to certain revenues, operating expenses and service cost of sales  with currency options and forward contracts. These currency options and forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedges,  generally have maturities of less than 24 months. The derivative instrument’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of  AOCI and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. During the fiscal years presented,  we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur. We enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce the short-term effects of foreign currency fluctuations  on assets and liabilities such as foreign currency receivables, long-term customer financings and payables. These derivatives  are not designated as hedging instruments. Gains and losses on the contracts are included in other income (loss), net, and  substantially offset foreign exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of intercompany balances, other current assets,  or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity. We hedge certain net investments in our foreign operations with forward contracts to reduce the effects of foreign currency  fluctuations on our net investment in those foreign subsidiaries. These derivative instruments generally have maturities of up  to six months.

Under these interest rate swaps, we receive fixed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on LIBOR  plus a fixed number of basis points. The effect of such swaps is to convert the fixed interest rates of the senior fixed-rate notes  to floating interest rates based on LIBOR. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are  included in interest expense and substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that  are attributable to the changes in market interest rates. We hold marketable equity securities in our portfolio that are subject to price risk. To diversify our overall portfolio, we also hold  equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. The change in the fair value of each of these investment types  are included in other income (loss), net. We are also exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees.  Although not designated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this  exposure and offset the related compensation expense. 14.  Commitments and Contingencies (a)  Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services  for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate  component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory  based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. A significant portion of our reported  purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. Certain  of these purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure long-term supply  and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to  cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. 1 to 3 years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  1,806 412 3 to 5 years . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  1,545 — We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future  demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. As of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, the  liability for these purchase commitments was $151 million and $141 million, respectively, and was included in other current  liabilities. The provision for the liability related to purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers was $76  million, $139 million, and $95 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of  certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or upon the continued employment with Cisco of  certain employees of the acquired entities.

Our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from 90 days to  five years, and for some products we provide a limited lifetime warranty. In the ordinary course of business, we provide financing guarantees for various third-party financing arrangements extended  to channel partners and end-user customers. Payments under these financing guarantee arrangements were not material for the  periods presented. Channel Partner Financing Guarantees We facilitate arrangements for third-party financing extended to channel partners,  consisting of revolving short-term financing, with payment terms generally ranging from 60 to 90 days. These financing  arrangements facilitate the working capital requirements of the channel partners, and, in some cases, we guarantee a portion of  these arrangements. The volume of channel partner financing was $26.7 billion, $26.9 billion, and $29.6 billion in fiscal 2021,  2020, and 2019, respectively. The balance of the channel partner financing subject to guarantees was $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion  as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively. End-User Financing Guarantees We also provide financing guarantees for third-party financing arrangements extended to end-  user customers related to leases and loans, which typically have terms of up to three years. The volume of financing provided by  third parties for leases and loans as to which we had provided guarantees was $10 million, $9 million, and $14 million in fiscal  2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Brazilian tax authorities have assessed claims against our Brazilian  subsidiary based on a theory of joint liability with the Brazilian importer for import taxes, interest, and penalties. In addition to  claims asserted by the Brazilian federal tax authorities in prior fiscal years, tax authorities from the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo  have asserted similar claims on the same legal basis in prior fiscal years. The asserted claims by Brazilian federal tax authorities are for calendar years 2003 through 2007, and the asserted claims by the  tax authorities from the state of Sao Paulo are for calendar years 2005 through 2007. The total asserted claims by Brazilian state  and federal tax authorities aggregate to $155 million for the alleged evasion of import and other taxes, $771 million for interest,  and $384 million for various penalties, all determined using an exchange rate as of July 31, 2021. We have completed a thorough review of the matters and believe the asserted claims against our Brazilian subsidiary are without  merit, and we are defending the claims vigorously. While we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability, due to the  complexities and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in Brazil and the nature of the claims asserting joint liability with  the importer, we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our Brazilian subsidiary and are  unable to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any. We do not expect a final judicial determination for several years. China We are investigating allegations of a self-enrichment scheme involving now-former employees in China. Some of those  employees are also alleged to have made or directed payments from the funds they received to various third parties, including  employees of state-owned enterprises. We voluntarily disclosed this investigation to the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and  Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). We take such allegations very seriously and we are providing results of our  investigation to the DOJ and SEC. While the outcome of our investigation is currently not determinable, we do not expect that  it will have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. SRI International On September 4, 2013, SRI International, Inc. (“SRI”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the  U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (“D. Del.”), accusing our products and services in the area of network intrusion  detection of infringing two patents. SRI sought monetary damages of at least a reasonable royalty and enhanced damages. On  May 12, 2016, a jury returned a verdict finding willful infringement. The jury awarded SRI damages of $24 million. On May 25,  2017, the district court awarded SRI enhanced damages and attorneys’ fees, entered judgment in the new amount of $57 million,  and ordered an ongoing royalty of 3.5% through the expiration of the patents in 2018. We appealed to the United States Court  of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“Federal Circuit”), and on July 12, 2019, the Federal Circuit vacated the enhanced damages It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount for claims made under the indemnification obligations discussed  in this section (e) due to uncertainties in the litigation process, coordination with and contributions by other parties and the  defendants in these cases, and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular case and agreement. We are  unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of the cases discussed below in this section (e), but we do not believe that  any potential indemnity liability would be material, and historically, indemnity payments made by us have not had a material  effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. We were asked to indemnify certain of our service provider customers that were subject to patent infringement claims asserted  by ChanBond, LLC (“ChanBond”) in federal court in Delaware on September 21, 2015. All of the service provider customer  defendants entered into an agreement to resolve ChanBond’s claims. We resolved the service providers’ indemnity claims,  effective July 7, 2021, for an amount that did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Verizon Communications Inc. requested that we indemnify it and seven of its subsidiaries (collectively, “Verizon”) for a subset of  the patent infringement claims asserted by Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (“Huawei”) in lawsuits filed against Verizon on February  5, 2020, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (“E.D. Tex”) and the United States District Court for the  Western District of Texas (“W.D. Tex”). Huawei and Verizon reached a confidential settlement agreement and Huawei dismissed  both the E.D. Tex and W.D. Tex cases. Verizon indicated that they no longer are seeking indemnity contribution from us. We have been asked by seven of our customers to indemnify them in connection with patent infringement claims asserted  against them by Estech Systems, Inc. (“Estech”) in the E.D. Tex and W.D. Tex courts between April 24, 2020 and August 25,  2020. Estech alleges that the customer defendants infringe three patents generally related to IP telephony by using collaboration  technology from us and other providers. Estech is seeking monetary damages from the customer defendants. The first E.D. Tex  case against one of the customer defendants is scheduled for trial on October 4, 2021, and the W.D. Tex cases are set for trial on  December 7, 2021 and April 1, 2022. We believe the customer defendants have strong defenses and do not believe our indemnity  obligations, if any, would have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our Amended and Restated  Bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents. award; vacated and remanded in part the willful infringement finding; vacated and remanded the attorneys’ fees award  for  further proceedings; and affirmed the district court’s other findings. On April 1, 2020, the district court issued a final judgment  on the remanded issues, finding no evidence of willful infringement and reinstating the $8 million award of attorneys’ fees. SRI  appealed the judgment of no willful infringement to the Federal Circuit on April 3, 2020, and Cisco filed a cross-appeal on the  attorneys’ fees award on April 9, 2020. Cisco has paid SRI $28 million, representing the portion of the judgment that the Federal  Circuit previously affirmed, plus interest and royalties on post-verdict sales. While the remaining proceedings may result in an  additional loss, we do not believe it would have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Centripetal On February 13, 2018, Centripetal Networks, Inc. (“Centripetal”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in  the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, alleging that several Cisco products and services (including Cisco’s  Catalyst switches, ASR and ISR series routers, ASAs with FirePOWER services, and Stealthwatch products) infringe eleven  Centripetal U.S. patents. Cisco thereafter petitioned the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the United States Patent  and Trademark Office (“PTO”) to review the validity of nine of the asserted patents. The PTAB instituted inter partes review  proceedings (“IPR Proceedings”) on six asserted patents and certain claims of another asserted patent. The PTAB has issued  Final Written Decisions for seven patents in the instituted IPR Proceedings, and all claims of five patents have been found  unpatentable and several of the claims of the other two patents have been found unpatentable. Centripetal appealed the PTAB’s  findings of unpatentability to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit affirmed the PTAB’s findings of unpatentability as to  three of the patents on March 10, 2021, and affirmed the PTAB’s findings of unpatentability as to the remaining four patents on  May 11, 2021. On August 9, 2021, Centripetal filed a writ of certiorari seeking the U.S. Supreme Court’s review of the Federal  Circuit’s affirmance of several of the PTAB’s unpatentability findings. For the five asserted U.S. patents not subject to the IPR Proceedings, the district court conducted a bench trial by  videoconference from May 6, 2020 to June 25, 2020. On October 5, 2020, the district court issued a judgment finding validity  and willful infringement of four of the asserted patents and non-infringement of the fifth patent. The district court awarded  Centripetal $1.9 billion, comprised of $756 million in damages, $1.1 billion in enhanced damages for willful infringement,  and pre-judgment interest in the amount of $14 million. The district court declined to issue an injunction but, instead, awarded  Centripetal a running royalty against revenue from the products found to infringe for an initial three-year term at a rate of 10%,  with a minimum annual royalty of $168 million and a maximum annual royalty of $300 million, and for a second three-year  term at a rate of 5%, with a minimum annual royalty of $84 million and a maximum annual royalty of $150 million. We believe  that the district court’s findings of validity, infringement, and willful infringement, its award of damages, including enhanced  damages, and its award of an ongoing royalty are not supported by either the law or the evidence presented at trial. We have  appealed the district court’s judgment as to the four patents found valid and infringed to the Federal Circuit. On October 28,  2020, by agreement of the parties, the district court stayed execution of the judgment until after resolution of any appeal in the  matter and waived the requirement of any bond or security; accordingly, no money is currently due under the judgment. On April 29, 2020 and April 30, 2020, Centripetal submitted complaints in the District Court of Dusseldorf in Germany against  Cisco Systems GmbH and Cisco Systems, Inc., asserting three European patents seeking both injunctive relief and damages.  Two of the three European patents are counterparts to two U.S. patents Centripetal asserted against us in the U.S. district court  proceedings, one of which has been invalidated by the PTAB. On June 22, 2021, Centripetal amended one of its complaints to  assert one additional European patent and one additional German Utility Model patent. Centripetal seeks both injunctive relief  and damages on these newly added patents. We believe we have strong defenses. Due to uncertainty surrounding patent litigation processes in the U.S. and Europe, however, we are unable to reasonably estimate  the ultimate outcome of either litigation at this time. If we do not prevail in either litigation, we believe that any damages  ultimately assessed would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Finjan On January 6, 2017, Finjan, Inc. (“Finjan”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in the U.S. District Court for  the Northern District of California. On May 24, 2021, we resolved Finjan’s claims for an amount that did not have a material  effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Ramot On June 12, 2019, Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd. (“Ramot”) asserted patent infringement claims against us in E.D.  Tex, seeking damages, including enhanced damages for allegations of willful infringement, and a running royalty on future  sales. Ramot alleges that certain Cisco optical transceiver modules and line cards infringe three patents. As of November 27,  2020, the PTO preliminarily found all asserted claims unpatentable in ex parte reexamination proceedings. On January 13, 2021,  the court entered an order staying the case pending the conclusion of the ex parte reexamination proceedings (“Reexamination  Proceedings”). While we believe that we have strong non-infringement and invalidity arguments, and that Ramot’s damages  theories are not supported by prevailing law, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of this litigation at  this time due to uncertainties in the litigation processes. If we do not prevail in court, we believe that any damages ultimately  assessed would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On February 26, 2021, Ramot asserted patent infringement claims against Acacia Communications, Inc. (“Acacia”) (which we  subsequently acquired) in D. Del, seeking damages, including enhanced damages for allegations of willful infringement, and a running royalty on future sales. Ramot alleges that certain Acacia optical transceiver modules and integrated circuits infringe  two of the three patents that Ramot has asserted in its E.D. Tex case. On September 3, 2021, the court stayed the case pending  the ultimate resolution of the Reexamination Proceedings. Due to the early stage of the litigation as well as uncertainties in the  litigation processes, we are unable, at this time, to reasonably estimate a potential range of loss, if any, or the ultimate outcome  of this litigation. Monarch On January 21, 2020, Monarch Networking Solutions LLC (“Monarch”) asserted patent infringement claims against  us in E.D. Tex alleging that certain Cisco routers and firewalls infringe three U.S. patents. On May 13, 2020, Monarch filed  a second action against us in W.D. Tex, alleging that two factor authentication functionality in Duo and Meraki MR and MX  access point products infringe one U.S. patent. On June 24, 2021, we resolved Monarch’s claims in both E.D. Tex and W.D. Tex  for an amount that did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Viasat On January 21, 2016, Viasat, Inc. (“Viasat”) filed suit against Acacia (which we subsequently acquired) in the California  Superior Court for San Diego County (“SDSC”) seeking unpaid royalties for breach of contract and the implied covenant of good  faith and fair dealing, and damages for trade secret misappropriation for certain products (“Viasat 1”). Acacia counterclaimed  for patent and trade secret misappropriation, contract, and unfair competition claims. On July 17, 2019, the jury found for Viasat  on its contract claims, and awarded Viasat $49 million for unpaid royalties through 2018. The jury further found that Acacia  willfully misappropriated Viasat’s trade secrets and awarded Viasat $1. On Acacia’s counterclaims, the jury found for Acacia  on its contract and trade secret claims and awarded Acacia $1. Both Acacia and Viasat have pending appeals to the California  Court of Appeal. On November 6, 2019, Viasat filed a second suit in SDSC, alleging contract and trade secret claims for Acacia  products sold from January 1, 2019 forward (“Viasat 2”). On February 28, 2020, the court stayed Viasat 2 pending the appeal  in Viasat 1. On June 9, 2020, Viasat filed a third suit in SDSC (“Viasat 3”). In Viasat 3, Viasat alleges contract and trade secrets  claims for sales of additional Acacia products. On August 11, 2020, the court stayed Viasat 3 pending the appeal in Viasat 1. On July 28, 2017, Acacia filed suit in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior Court - Business Litigation Session  against ViaSat alleging claims for defamation, unfair competition, business torts, and declaratory judgment of no trade  secret misappropriation. On April 5, 2018, ViaSat counterclaimed with contract, trade secret, and unfair competition claims  (collectively, with Viasat 1, Viasat 2 and Viasat 3, the “Viasat Cases”). On December 13, 2018, the Massachusetts court entered  an order staying the Massachusetts litigation, which has been extended to December 31, 2021. While we believe Acacia has strong defenses in each of the Viasat Cases, we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate  outcome of any of the Viasat Cases at this time due to uncertainties in the litigation processes. If Acacia does not prevail, we  believe that any relief ultimately assessed in any of the Viasat Cases would not have a material effect on our Consolidated  Financial Statements. In addition, we are subject to other legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including  intellectual property litigation. While the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable, we do not believe that the  ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information regarding intellectual property litigation, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—We may be found to  infringe on intellectual property rights of others” herein. Under the terms of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is authorized to issue  preferred stock of one or more series and, in connection with the creation of such series, to fix by resolution the designation,  powers (including voting powers (if any)), preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights of such series,  and any qualification, limitations or restrictions thereof, of the shares of such series. As of July 31, 2021, we had not issued any  shares of preferred stock. Employee Benefit Plans (a) Employee Stock Incentive Plans Stock Incentive Plan Program Description We have one stock incentive plan: the 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”).  In addition, we have, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, assumed the share-based awards granted under  stock incentive plans of the acquired companies or issued share-based awards in replacement thereof. Share-based awards are  designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to us and provide incentives for them to remain with us. The  number and frequency of share-based awards are based on competitive practices, our operating results, government regulations,  and other factors. Our primary stock incentive plan is summarized as follows: 2005 Plan The 2005 Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock grants, stock units and stock appreciation rights (SARs), the  vesting of which may be time-based or upon satisfaction of performance goals, or both, and/or other conditions. Employees (including  employee directors and executive officers) and consultants of Cisco and its subsidiaries and affiliates and non-employee directors of  Cisco are eligible to participate in the 2005 Plan. As of July 31, 2021, the maximum number of shares issuable under the 2005 Plan  over its term was 790 million shares. The 2005 Plan may be terminated by our Board of Directors at any time and for any reason, and  is currently set to terminate at the 2030 Annual Meeting unless re-adopted or extended by our stockholders prior to or on such date. Under the 2005 Plan’s share reserve feature, a distinction is made between the number of shares in the reserve attributable to (i) stock  options and SARs and (ii) “full value” awards (i.e., stock grants and stock units). Shares issued as stock grants, pursuant to stock  units or pursuant to the settlement of dividend equivalents are counted against shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan on a  1.5-to-1 ratio. For each share awarded as restricted stock or a restricted stock unit award under the 2005 Plan, 1.5 shares was deducted  from the available share-based award balance. If awards issued under the 2005 Plan are forfeited or terminated for any reason before There was $25 million in stock repurchases that were pending settlement as of July 31, 2021. There was no stock repurchases  pending settlement as of July 25, 2020. There was $40 million in stock repurchases that were pending settlement as of July 27,  2019. The purchase price for the shares of our stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ equity. We are required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as (i) a reduction to retained earnings or an increase to  accumulated deficit and (ii) a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital.

Any future dividends will be subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. (b) Stock Repurchase Program In September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program. As of July 31, 2021, the remaining authorized  amount for stock repurchases under this program was approximately $7.9 billion with no termination date.

As of July 31, 2021, 245 million shares were authorized for future grant  under the 2005 Plan. We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which 721 million shares of our common stock have been reserved for issuance  as of July 31, 2021. Eligible employees are offered shares through a 24-month offering period, which consists of four consecutive  6-month purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited amount of shares of our stock at a discount of up to 15% of the  lesser of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or the end of each 6-month purchase period. The Employee  Stock Purchase Plan is scheduled to terminate on the earlier of (i) January 3, 2030 and (ii) the date on which all shares available  for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan are sold pursuant to exercised purchase rights. We issued 17 million,  18 million, and 19 million shares under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of  July 31, 2021, 125 million shares were available for issuance under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Share-based compensation expense consists primarily of expenses for RSUs, stock purchase rights, and stock options, granted  to employees or assumed from acquisitions.

(50) 29.25 $ 2,446 The PRSUs granted during the fiscal years presented are contingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics,  our comparative market-based returns, or the achievement of financial and non-financial operating goals. For the awards based  on financial performance metrics or comparative market-based returns, generally 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on the  average of annual operating cash flow and earnings per share goals established at the beginning of each fiscal year over a  three-year performance period. Generally, the remaining 50% of the PRSUs are earned based on our TSR measured against  the benchmark TSR of a peer group over the same period. Each PRSU recipient could vest in 0% to 150% of the target shares  granted contingent on the achievement of our financial performance metrics or our comparative market-based returns, and 0%  to 100% of the target shares granted contingent on the achievement of non-financial operating goals. The valuation of employee stock purchase rights and the related assumptions are for the employee stock purchases made during  the respective fiscal years. We used third-party analyses to assist in developing the assumptions used in our Black-Scholes model. We are responsible for  determining the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our share-based payment awards. We used the implied volatility for traded options (with contract terms corresponding to the expected life of the employee stock  purchase rights) on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the Black-Scholes model. The implied volatility  is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon  observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock purchase rights. The dividend yield assumption is based  on the history and expectation of dividend payouts at the grant date.

On the date of grant, we estimated the fair value of the total shareholder return (TSR) component of the PRSUs using  a Monte Carlo simulation model.

As allowed under  Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Plan provides for tax-deferred salary contributions and after-tax contributions  for eligible employees. The Plan allows employees to contribute up to 75% of their annual eligible earnings to the Plan on a  pretax and after-tax basis, including Roth contributions. Employee contributions are limited to a maximum annual amount as  set periodically by the Internal Revenue Code. We match pretax and Roth employee contributions up to 100% of the first 4.5%  of eligible earnings that are contributed by employees. Therefore, the maximum matching contribution that we may allocate  to each participant’s account will not exceed $13,050 for the 2021 calendar year due to the $290,000 annual limit on eligible  earnings imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. All matching contributions vest immediately. Our matching contributions to  the Plan totaled $290 million, $295 million, and $283 million in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Plan allows employees who meet the age requirements and reach the Plan contribution limits to make catch-up contributions  (pretax or Roth) not to exceed the lesser of 75% of their annual eligible earnings or the limit set forth in the Internal Revenue  Code. Catch-up contributions are not eligible for matching contributions. In addition, the Plan provides for discretionary profit- sharing contributions as determined by the Board of Directors. Such contributions to the Plan are allocated among eligible  participants in the proportion of their salaries to the total salaries of all participants. There were no discretionary profit-sharing  contributions made in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. We also sponsor other 401(k) plans as a result of acquisitions of other companies. Our contributions to these plans were not  material to Cisco on either an individual or aggregate basis for any of the fiscal years presented. The Cisco Systems, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”), a nonqualified deferred compensation  plan, became effective in 2007. As required by applicable law, participation in the Deferred Compensation Plan is limited to  a select group of our management employees. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, which is an unfunded and unsecured  deferred compensation arrangement, a participant may elect to defer base salary, bonus, and/or commissions, pursuant to such  rules as may be established by Cisco, up to the maximum percentages for each deferral election as described in the plan.  We may also, at our discretion, make a matching contribution to the employee under the Deferred Compensation Plan. A  matching contribution equal to 4.5% of eligible compensation in excess of the Internal Revenue Code limit for qualified plans  for calendar year 2021 that is deferred by participants under the Deferred Compensation Plan (with a $1.5 million cap on eligible  compensation) will be made to eligible participants’ accounts at the end of calendar year 2021. The total deferred compensation  liability under the Deferred Compensation Plan, together with deferred compensation plans assumed from acquired companies,  was approximately $845 million and $704 million as of July 31, 2021 and July 25, 2020, respectively, and was recorded primarily  in other long-term liabilities.

This charge was the reversal of the previously  recorded benefit associated with the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends recorded in fiscal 2018 because of a retroactive  final U.S. Treasury regulation issued during fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2020, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Cisco settled all outstanding items related to the audit of our federal  income tax returns for the fiscal year ended July 30, 2011 through July 27, 2013. As a result of the settlement, we recognized a  net benefit to the provision for income taxes of $102 million, net of a reduction in interest expense of $4 million. Foreign taxes associated with the repatriation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries were not provided on a cumulative total of  $6.5 billion of undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries as of the end of fiscal 2021. We intend to reinvest these  earnings indefinitely in such foreign subsidiaries. If these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if  the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we could be subject to additional income and  withholding taxes. The amount of potential unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is approximately  $681 million.

(134) (81) As a result of certain employment and capital investment actions, our income in certain foreign countries was subject to reduced  tax rates. The tax incentives expired at the end of fiscal 2019. As of the end of fiscal 2019, the gross income tax benefits  attributable to tax incentives were estimated to be $0.3 billion ($0.08 per diluted share). The gross income tax benefits were  partially offset by accruals of U.S. income taxes on foreign earnings.

(39) (9) (23) As of July 31, 2021, $2.3 billion of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if realized. During fiscal 2021,  we recognized $74 million of net interest expense and increased our unrecognized tax benefits for prior year tax positions by  $618 million to reflect expected settlement positions in on-going U.S. federal, state, and foreign income tax return examinations.  We recognized net interest expense of $104 million during fiscal 2020 and $30 million during fiscal 2019. Our net penalty  expense for fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019 was not material. Our total accrual for interest and penalties was $444 million, $340  million, and $220 million as of the end of fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal  income tax audit for returns covering tax years through fiscal 2013. We are no longer subject to foreign or state income tax audits  for returns covering tax years through fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2008, respectively. We regularly engage in discussions and negotiations with tax authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. We  believe it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign, and state tax matters may be concluded in the next 12 months.  Specific positions that may be resolved include issues involving transfer pricing and various other matters. We estimate that the  unrecognized tax benefits at July 31, 2021 could be reduced by $800 million in the next 12 months.

A significant amount of the net operating loss carryforwards relates to acquisitions  and, as a result, is limited in the amount that can be recognized in any one year. If not utilized, the federal, state, and foreign  net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2022. We have provided a valuation allowance of $104 million for  deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses that are not expected to be realized. As of July 31, 2021, our federal, state, and foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $31  million, $1.4 billion, and $7 million, respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2023. The  majority of state and foreign tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. We have provided a valuation allowance of $595  million for deferred tax assets related to state and foreign tax credits carryforwards that are not expected to be realized. Segment Information and Major Customers  (a)  Revenue and Gross Margin by Segment We conduct business globally and are primarily managed on a geographic basis consisting of three segments: the Americas,  EMEA, and APJC. Our management makes financial decisions and allocates resources based on the information it receives from  our internal management system. Sales are attributed to a segment based on the ordering location of the customer. We do not  allocate research and development, sales and marketing, or general and administrative expenses to our segments in this internal  management system because management does not include the information in our measurement of the performance of the  operating segments. In addition, we do not allocate amortization and impairment of acquisition-related intangible assets, share- based compensation expense, significant litigation settlements and other contingencies, charges related to asset impairments  and restructurings, and certain other charges to the gross margin for each segment because management does not include this  information in our measurement of the performance of the operating segments.

The dilutive effect of such equity awards  is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock  method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and the amount of compensation cost for future service  that has not yet been recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures None. Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer),  as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded  that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of  1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”)) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that  we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in  Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our  principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s report on our internal control over financial reporting and the report of our independent registered public  accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting are set forth, respectively, on page 55 under the caption  “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” and on page 53 of this report. There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 that has materially  affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B.  Other Information Required Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) Under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, we are required to disclose in our periodic reports if we or any of our affiliates  knowingly conducted a transaction or dealing with entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. On  March 2, 2021, the U.S. government designated the Russian Federal Security Service (the “FSB”) as a blocked party subject to  such reporting requirements; however, on the same day, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control  updated General License No. 1B (the “OFAC General License”), which now also generally authorizes U.S. companies to engage  in certain transactions and dealings with the FSB necessary and ordinarily incident to requesting or obtaining licenses, permits,  certifications or notifications issued or registered by the FSB for the importation, distribution or use of information technology  products in Russia. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, a subsidiary of Cisco filed notifications with, or applied for import licenses and  permits from, the FSB as required pursuant to Russian encryption product import controls for the purpose of enabling Cisco  or our subsidiaries to import and distribute certain products in Russia. Neither Cisco nor our subsidiaries generated any gross  revenues or net profits directly from such approval activity and neither Cisco nor our subsidiaries sell to the FSB. Cisco expects  that we or our subsidiaries will continue to file notifications with and apply for import licenses and permits from the FSB as  required for importation and distribution of our products in Russia, if and as permitted by applicable law, including the OFAC  General License.

Bhatt  Senior Vice President and  Chief Accounting Officer Forward-looking statements This Summary Report and our Annual Report included herein, including the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations” discussed therein, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements other than statements of historical facts are  statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections about  the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “goals,” “projects,”  “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “momentum,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “continues,” “endeavors,” “strives,” “may,” variations of such words, and similar expressions are  intended to identify such forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to (1) projections of our future financial performance; (2) our anticipated  growth and trends in our businesses; (3) future responses to and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; (4) our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals,  commitments and programs; (5) the scope and impact of our corporate responsibility risks and opportunities, and the related standards and expectations of third  parties; and (6) other characterizations of future events or circumstances, are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking  statements are only predictions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified in the attached Form  10-K, under “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and elsewhere therein. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward- looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.

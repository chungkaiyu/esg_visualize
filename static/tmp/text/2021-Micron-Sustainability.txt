Challenge always presents opportunity. Throughout 2020, the  world recognized the realities of our interdependent economic  systems, and we were forced to face the weaknesses in our  social structures. The lessons from 2020 underscore a simple  truth: These racial and social inequalities are the biggest  obstacle to our collective well-being. Every organization must  be focused on all our stakeholders. But 2020 also proved  that innovative ways of thinking about how we work, learn  and interact create new opportunities for business resilience,  effectiveness and sustainability. Micron made significant advancements in 2020, deepening  our customer relationships and building on our rich history of  innovation to further transform into a company that enables a  better future for all. We developed new process technologies  for our storage and memory products. For the first time in  our history, we now lead the industry on both DRAM and  NAND technology. That technology leadership provides the  foundation for our next-generation solutions across a host  of markets and is the core enabler of our vision to transform  how the world uses information to enrich life for all. And  importantly, we amended our vision statement to add that  “for all” emphasis as a visible reminder of our commitments  to a more equitable future for everyone. Our Sustainability Strategy As we highlighted in our last report, Micron has adopted  specific long-term environmental sustainability goals in  four areas: emissions, energy, water and waste. We also  developed aggressive aspirational goals that guide our  long-term thinking. We committed to invest approximately  $1 billion over the next five to seven years to support these  goals. And because meaningful sustainability encompasses  all stakeholders and all opportunities, we also made  strong commitments in our sourcing practices, our people  programs, our products and our community involvement. diverse suppliers, engaging with minority-owned financial  institutions, strengthening our inclusive culture, increasing  diversity, and advocating for equality. Each pillar has specific  goals and executive ownership for accountability. We  continue to foster a company culture that values a diversity  of ideas among our teams. We also pursue programs that  engage our team’s passions to maximize the positive impact  we have on communities where we operate. 2020 Progress Community Support  We responded quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic, donating  hundreds of thousands of masks to health care workers  and distributing nearly $24 million to global organizations  focused on education and supporting basic needs. We also  reached more than 600,000 students and educators through  global STEM programs. We dramatically increased giving  overall, with nearly 60% of our team, 88% of senior leaders  and 100% of our board participating in 2020, generating  $4.8M in donations (most of it matched 2:1 by Micron to  deepen the impact) and 150,000 volunteer hours. DEI Goals  In addition to our focus on the six pillars mentioned above,  we made real progress fostering a more inclusive culture  and world. We increased our female board representation by  50% when Lynn Dugle joined last year, and we implemented  inclusive hiring practices to increase representation of  underrepresented groups. To support social justice,  Micron directed a $1 million donation from the Micron  Foundation to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education  Fund. We allocated $250 million for cash management  through minority-owned firms, boosting the economies of  underrepresented communities. Micron spent over $104  million with diverse-owned businesses and committed to  doubling that spend over the next two years. We increased  participation in our employee resource groups by 84%,  which enhance team member belonging, foster inclusivity  and strengthen connections within our communities globally. Emissions, Energy, Water and Waste   Emissions – We reduced greenhouse gas emissions per  unit of production by 36% since calendar year 2018  (CY18). Our goal is a 75% reduction of GHG per unit of  production from CY18 levels in CY30.  Energy – We initiated negotiations supporting new  renewable energy development and procurement to   meet our goal of using 100% renewable energy in the   U.S. in CY25.  Water – We maintained our water conservation rate at  50%. Our target is 75% water conservation through reuse,  recycling and restoration in CY30.   Waste – We expanded reuse, recycling and recovery to  84%. We are working toward 95% reuse, recycling and  recovery, and zero hazardous waste to the landfill in CY30. We continually strive to tangibly improve the lives of our  team members, the communities in which we operate and  the planet. With strong investment, innovative ideas and the  passionate dedication of our team, I am confident Micron  can exceed our goals and lead our industry in innovative  practices and ideas that create the best outcomes for the  future of our planet and our communities.

We are committed to enriching life for all  through technology innovation while staying true to our core  philosophy of conducting business with uncompromising integrity.  We are mindful that our business, operations and sourcing  practices affect our team members, our communities and our  planet, as well as our customers’ sustainability. We continuously  seek to challenge and strengthen our sustainability strategy —  which focuses on the environmental, social and governance  impacts that we have, as well as the effects these issues have  on the company — through our leadership products, responsible  operations and sourcing, and engaged team members. Our sustainability strategy is supported by effective governance  management and stakeholder engagement. Execution of our  strategy centers around initiatives that drive stakeholder value  through goals and transparency. Micron considers sustainability issues to be an integral  part of our business practices and corporate strategy.  The company’s board of directors encourages a proactive  approach to sustainable environmental practices, supporting  our team members and the communities in which they  live, respecting human rights, driving transparency and  accountability in our supply chain and developing innovative  products that promote a sustainable future for all. Environmental and social sustainability issues in Micron’s  supply chains, operations and products are managed by a  cross-functional sustainability council composed of senior  leaders throughout the company. The sustainability council is  guided by a dedicated sustainability team that works closely  with Micron functions to identify priority and emerging environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues;  defines our strategy to address priority issues; integrates  sustainability practices into key areas of the company; and  engages, builds relationships and exchanges information  with key stakeholders. Sustainability is managed throughout the company with  oversight extending from the sustainability team and council  to senior executives and, at the highest level, to the Micron  board of directors. The board, supported by the governance  and sustainability committee and other committees as  needed, oversees and monitors the development and  integration of Micron’s sustainability strategy and regularly  reviews sustainability performance. Along with other issues,  board oversight includes material ESG trends and related long- and short-term impacts of Micron’s operations, supply  chains and products, as well as the company’s activities and  annual public reporting on these topics. The governance and  sustainability committee reviews and discusses ESG issues  quarterly at each regularly scheduled committee meeting. In 2020, we updated and expanded sustainability  performance metrics used to determine the variable  compensation of executives and team members throughout  the company. Annual targets for our environmental programs  and for our diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,  which are aligned with our new goals in these areas, are now  part of performance reviews. Integrating sustainability into our business is strategically  important, helping Micron to both capitalize on opportunities  and better manage risks. Among other things, sustainability  is a differentiator when recruiting high-potential employees  in a competitive talent market and provides a platform for  increasing current team members’ engagement, satisfaction  and productivity. Natural resource conservation and waste  reduction make us a more disciplined and efficient operation,  which can directly enhance our bottom line. Plus, conducting  our business with integrity and in a socially responsible  manner in the communities where we live and work is  consistent with our corporate and sustainability goals. While working to realize these opportunities, we also  focus on identifying, assessing, quantifying and managing  sustainability risks. Climate change, extreme weather events,  global pandemics, natural disasters and carbon pricing  pose risks to our supply chains, operations and markets. © Micron 2021 10 Micron - Boise, Idaho, U.S. work to better understand and address these risks through  collaboration among our sustainability, environmental health  and safety, and responsible sourcing programs, along with  our various risk management organizations. Current efforts include improving operational energy  and water efficiency; working toward our new long-term  goals and targets for energy, emissions, water and waste;  and monitoring regulatory, customer, investor and other  stakeholder expectations. Additional comprehensive Micron  disclosures about sustainability-related opportunities and  risks are available through our annual CDP climate and   water questionnaires as well as other sources noted in the  Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures   (TCFD) index. strategy, objective-setting and daily operations. We do this  by providing tools and knowledge, facilitating open global  communication and monitoring continuously. Micron has a  network of risk management functions operating across the  company, including environmental, health and safety (EHS),  information technology (IT), business continuity, global  quality management, and enterprise risk management (ERM).   Our ERM organization accumulates key risk information  from the executive risk committee, which consists of select  company executives, along with risk assessments performed  by other risk management organizations. These results are  regularly presented to the executive risk committee, the audit  committee of the board of directors, and Micron’s full board  of directors for consideration. Integrating sustainability  into our business is  strategically important,  helping Micron to both  capitalize on opportunities  and better manage risks. Informing our sustainability strategy, the work of our sustainability  council and the topics covered in this sustainability report are  insights from a materiality assessment. Micron conducts a full  materiality assessment on a three-year cycle and evaluates  priorities annually to ensure that the issues of greatest impact  and importance to our stakeholders and our business are  reflected in company sustainability initiatives, goals and  reporting. Our most recent assessment was conducted in 2018,  with a comprehensive update underway for 2021. Assessments begin with an extensive list of ESG issues that  cover all aspects of our business. These issues then undergo an  extensive data collection and review process that includes internal  and external stakeholder and expert interviews, internal company  documents, industry information and third-party assessments.   This information is used to calculate results and map issues  to visualize their relative importance to our stakeholders, our  sustainability impact and our business success. We use this map  to identify those areas where we have the greatest potential to  drive meaningful change and enhance transparency. Today’s laws and standards of business conduct are  complex, and Integrity Matters: The Micron Code of  Business Conduct and Ethics is a practical resource that  sets out the core policies, rules and principles that Micron  applies to our business regarding risk, legal and ethical  issues. Above all else, the code emphasizes that integrity  comes before business results. It also explains Micron team  members’ personal responsibility to speak up if they see  something that does not seem right. The Micron code of conduct, which is available to the  public, supports team members, organizations, contractors  and suppliers in conducting business with integrity — with  one another, investors, communities and the marketplace.  The code was updated in 2020 to add supplemental  guidance on conflicts of interest — particularly with respect  to relationships in the workplace and service on for-profit  company boards — and on Micron’s commitment to DEI. Team members receive online training and certify annually  that they have read, understand and will comply with Micron’s  code of conduct. We also provide frequent, targeted live  group and one-on-one trainings on ethics and compliance  at Micron — especially on acting with integrity, avoiding  corruption, dealing fairly in the marketplace and protecting  our confidential information. In 2020, we implemented  “integrity at Micron” conversations with all newly hired or  promoted officers and senior directors to emphasize the  importance of integrity with all Micron leaders. The code of conduct and all other global policies, including  translations in seven languages, are available to team  members worldwide on our policy management site. Links to  the code are also located on the Micron intranet homepage  and internal compliance and ethics (C&E) site. Micron’s senior vice president of legal affairs and general  counsel serves as our chief compliance officer and is  responsible for ongoing oversight of compliance with our  code of conduct. Besides the code, we have adopted global  public and internal policies addressing responsible minerals; environment, health and safety; human rights; slavery and  human trafficking; supplier responsibility; anti-bribery and  anti-corruption; and others. According to our global policy  framework, global policies are reviewed and vetted by a  policy council composed of director- and vice president- level executives, initially approved by a policy committee  composed of senior and executive vice presidents, and  finally approved by our CEO. In addition, Micron is a member of the Responsible Business  Alliance (RBA), a group of leading companies focused on  promoting responsible working conditions, ethical business  practices and environmental stewardship throughout our  global supply chain. Our adherence to both the Micron and  RBA codes of conduct demonstrates our commitment to  integrity and responsible practices. Micron - Boise, Idaho, U.S. We educate and encourage all team members, vendors  and third parties to speak up to their managers, Micron’s  legal department or our compliance hotline if they suspect  violations of our code, policies or commitment to act with  integrity. This hotline is operated by a third party, available  24/7 and accessible through all commonly used languages  at Micron, and it supports anonymous reporting (when  and where permitted by applicable law). To facilitate team  member reporting, the C&E intranet site contains links to  forms about conflicts of interest or government gift approval.  We also maintain a dedicated C&E email address for team  members and external parties to request information, ask  questions or report concerns. “ Unwavering integrity is a  foundational principle that  underlies our corporate  values and how we conduct  business at Micron. Our  code provides guidelines  on how to act with integrity,  make ethical choices and  do the right thing. We foster  a ‘speak up’ culture, where  everyone feels comfortable  asking questions and  reporting concerns.” © Micron 2021 13 Micron - San Jose, California, U.S. Micron’s vision and commitment to integrity guide our actions  related to taxation. Meeting our tax obligations, directly and  through our affiliated entities, in every country where we operate  is one of the ways we address our responsibilities to society. Tax Governance & Risk Management  Micron supports tax policies, at the U.S. and international  levels, that recognize our industry and its place in the global  marketplace and that promote growth in a predictable and  transparent manner. We are committed to complying fully with  all relevant tax laws and regulations, filing all required tax returns  and disclosing all relevant facts and circumstances. We employ  an appropriately qualified and experienced tax team that is an  integral part of the broader finance function reporting to our chief  financial officer. Our tax team proactively manages, reviews and  reports on the various direct and indirect local country taxes  and monitors tax risks. These include implications from new tax  legislation and policies, as well as from changes in our business.  Given the nature of our business, risks inevitably arise from  tax laws that are complex and uncertain at times. Where the  application of tax law to a transaction or commercial situation  is unclear, we routinely seek professional advice to ensure the  integrity of our tax filing and compliance duties worldwide. In  addition, our board’s audit committee receives periodic updates  on significant changes in tax legislation that may affect our  business, as well as details of any global tax audits or disputes. Group Dealings With Tax Authorities  Micron is committed to fostering positive, transparent and  respectful relations with the tax authorities in the jurisdictions  where we operate. We work collaboratively and positively with tax  authorities to address inquiries, and we resolve any differences  through timely and transparent discussions or, if necessary,  through established channels for dispute resolution. Because stakeholders, both inside and outside the company,  drive our business success, we take measures to understand  our local influence and the effect of our operations, supply  chains and products on people, the environment and  society. To do this, we partner with a range of organizations  to properly inform the decisions we make. Throughout our  global operations, we engage with key stakeholders based  on their material relationship to our operational success and  on our potential to affect them through our operations. This  outreach occurs at the local, subsidiary and corporate levels. Customers Our customers are increasingly focused on the ESG  performance of their suppliers, including Micron. Many  customers use sustainability as one of their criteria for  evaluating Micron’s overall performance as part of the  management of their own supply chain and reputation  risks. In their assessments, they look at transparency,  risk management, environmental and social performance,  responsible sourcing and related topics. Customers include  this information in their supplier performance evaluations and  purchasing decisions, alongside quality, delivery, technology  and service. That’s why our sales team executives, account  managers and sustainability leaders work closely with our  customers — to share information about our sustainability  efforts and performance, drive action and build trust. Investors Micron regularly discusses our corporate ESG performance  with the investment community, and in turn, our ESG  disclosures evolve based on investor feedback. We have  engaged with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board  (SASB) to support these efforts, joining the SASB Standards  Advisory Group and issuing a sustainability reporting index  aligned with the SASB semiconductor industry standard. Governments & Policymakers Engagement in the political process is vital to Micron’s  success. Public policy decisions can directly affect Micron’s strategies, investments, operations, team members and  communities. Micron promotes policies that enhance our  ability to innovate and advocates at all levels of government  to ensure that our voice is heard on the issues most  important to Micron’s business interests and values. We  also participate in the political process through lobbying,  public engagement, political contributions and membership  in various industry and trade associations. Micron complies  with all applicable laws and regulations that oversee  interactions with government officials and adheres to our  own high standards of ethical conduct. Micron - Boise, Idaho, U.S. Team Members, Communities & Suppliers Team members, the communities where we live and  work, and our suppliers are vital to our operations. These  stakeholder groups are covered in detail in the People,  Communities, and Responsible Sourcing sections. “ Micron’s engagements  and partnerships  are accelerating and  evolving along with our  sustainability programs.  Collaboration is one of  our values, and we need  to expand our work with  others as we address  some of the world’s most  significant challenges.” ‐ Italy Industry Trade Association    ‐ Northern Virginia Technology Council    ‐ SEMI   ‐ Singapore Semiconductor Industry Association    ‐ Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)   ‐ Silicon Valley Leadership Group  ‐ Taiwan Association of Trade Secrets Protection  ‐ Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association  ‐ U.S. Chamber of Commerce   ‐ U.S.-China Business Council    ‐ U.S.-India Strategic Partnership    ‐ U.S. Information Technology Office    ‐ U.S.-Taiwan Business Council    ‐ Utah Taxpayers Association Micron’s memory and storage solutions are at the core of countless  digital devices. We’re constantly innovating to make those solutions  faster and more efficient. Micron’s vision is to transform how the world uses  information to enrich life for all. We are proud to provide  solutions that drive performance and access to information  technology and to help our customers achieve their goals for  benefiting society and the environment. All modern computing hardware depends on shared  underlying technology — semiconductor memory and  storage — to access and store data. Advancements in  memory and storage solutions set the pace for technology  development and, therefore, breakthroughs that improve  our way of life. A new generation of technologies, including  artificial intelligence (AI), precision medicine, the internet  of things (IoT), autonomous vehicles and cloud computing, could further expand what’s possible for society and our  planet. As innovations like these enter the mainstream and  demands for memory and storage increase, the need to  analyze, access and act on data grows. By enabling rapid advancements in memory and storage,  Micron is helping unlock the innovations that will make a  better future possible. Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high- performance DRAM, NAND, NOR, high-bandwidth memory  and multichip package solutions, and we work closely  with customers to create specialized memory and storage  architectures. As a leader in the semiconductor industry for  more than 40 years, we have taken part in every stage of  these vital technologies’ evolution. Memory and storage affect the sustainability of a variety of  end products, from computer energy use to vehicle safety  and even the efficiency of our own manufacturing facilities.  This influence is why we strive to consistently improve  performance, investing in research to deliver higher capacity,  greater security, faster data transfer rates, lower power  consumption, increased energy and material efficiency,  and improved reliability. Through supplier engagement,  technology development and legal compliance, we evaluate  new materials to ensure the safety of our team members  and our products. Memory and storage  affect the sustainability of  a variety of end products,  from computer energy use  to vehicle safety and even  the efficiency of our own  manufacturing facilities. Through Micron’s deep  learning accelerator (DLA)  program, we are partnering  with customers on AI  applications that will   create the technological  capabilities of the future. A significant part of the DLA effort involves eliminating  wasteful and unnecessary data movement between  processor and memory. This streamlining ensures that  advanced computations are not only faster but also more  energy-efficient. Our collaborations with others are enabling  autonomous vehicles to operate more intelligently, sparking  discovery in science and medicine and helping communities  address basic human needs. Here are a few ways that the  DLA is working with partners to accelerate sustainability  and social good. Engaging With Customers for Vehicle Safety   Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will revolutionize road safety,  dramatically reducing the thousands of crashes caused  by human error each year. They will also be the ultimate  “intelligent edge” devices, collecting enormous amounts  of data that must be converted into decisions in real time.  Micron’s technology is key to making AVs viable stand-alone  devices, where all processing is done within the vehicle.  Together with Continental AG, we are using neural network  models to predict pedestrian behavior. The neural network  also monitors a vehicle’s driver and other occupants to track  alertness and attention so that AVs can operate more safely. Accelerating Precision Oncology  Precision oncology, an emerging approach in cancer care,  involves tailoring treatments for individual patients and  tumor types. The process requires measuring, visualizing and integrating various levels of clinical information, from  symptom expression all the way down to tumor-level DNA.  This generates many terabytes of data that are highly  complex and time-consuming to process. Our DLA, in conjunction with the Oregon Health & Science  University (OHSU), is a mix of AI hardware, software and  advanced memory that allows researchers to process  entire high-resolution tumor images in a time frame that is  clinically relevant. The team’s three priorities are optimizing  neural network performance, speeding up data analysis  and using Micron’s advanced memory solutions to improve  image analysis and processing. In 2020, the team focused  on applying insights extracted from tumor images. Next,  the team will look at additional imaging modalities and  automated analytics. Advancing Basic Human Needs  Since 2019, Micron has teamed up with Water.org in a  unique partnership that combines our philanthropic efforts  with our technological expertise. Water.org partners with  microfinance institutions to provide small loans to help  people put water and sanitation solutions like taps and  toilets in their homes. Once people no longer have to spend  long hours fetching water, they can seek employment  outside the home, pursue education and keep their families  safe and healthy. Repaid loans are then lent to the next  family in need. To help incentivize microfinance institutions to increase  water and sanitation lending, Micron developed a neural  network architecture to identify the characteristics of a  successful portfolio. This solution is expected to be tested  and deployed in 2021, allowing Water.org to combine human  intuition with intelligent software for better decision-making.  In addition to the technology solution, the partnership has  reached 10,000 people with life-changing access to safe  water and sanitation. AI solutions like those developed by Micron’s DLAs  can do good. But in the wrong hands, they can also  be used in illegal, unethical or discriminatory ways.  Micron is committed to participating in continuing  conversations about ethics in AI. Micron has taken  part in both governmental and private roundtables  including the AI for Good Global Summit, the United  Nations’ platform for this topic. Micron’s industry-leading  products mitigate the growing  energy demands of IT while  enabling technologies that  increase the efficiency   of infrastructure and   industrial processes. More than half a century ago, Gordon Moore predicted that  the number of transistors possible on a silicon chip would  double every year. While Moore’s law has been modified,  questioned and declared dead multiple times over the years,  Micron continues to drive rapid improvements in the power  requirements, performance and area of each successive  generation of chips. These advancements help Micron meet the power  requirements of AI, the IoT, our cloud computing customers  and the world at large. Efficiency is both an important  performance requirement — to improve battery life and  reduce heat output, for example — and a means of  addressing the environmental impacts of IT use. Data  centers alone use about 1% of global electricity, much  of which comes from fossil fuel sources contributing to  climate change. With IT use projected to grow significantly  in the coming years, product efficiency will play an  important role in Micron’s efforts to address the influence of  technology on the environment. For example, we are working to make each generation of our  memory solutions for data center servers do more with less  energy per bit. Transitioning from DDR4 to DDR5 products,  which will take place over the next few years, is expected to  reduce DRAM power consumption by approximately 14%,  lowering costs for data center customers. Similarly, as the  need for greater computing and data-processing capabilities  on handheld devices grows, these devices cannot trade energy efficiency for performance. In early 2021, Micron  introduced 1α (1alpha) node LPDRAM products, which are  up to 15% more power-efficient than previous generations,  allowing 5G mobile users to perform more tasks on their  smartphones without sacrificing battery life.  We collaborate with customers to deliver memory and  storage solutions that meet increased expectations for energy  efficiency. Micron’s system power calculators are online tools  that allow customers to estimate memory power use when  they make system architecture and design decisions. Micron’s products also enable automation and efficiency  across sectors, from industrial applications to transportation.  Micron’s industrial memory solutions, including embedded AI  accelerators and local storage, make it possible for industrial  IoT (IIoT) edge infrastructure to collect, process and share  data that increases energy efficiency and reduces waste. We have seen these results in our own operations, where  we collect petabytes of data to drive real-time performance  monitoring, significantly improving labor productivity and  production efficiency. In addition, AVs need our DRAM products to provide data  quickly for real-time processing, allowing these vehicles to  be safer and more efficient. At the same time, our products  support the networks facilitating the smooth flow of the  entire vehicle transportation system. Our solid-state drives  provide the storage for map data, image data, sensor  readings, program code, and data being generated at a rate  of 5 gigabytes each second. “ Micron is investing in new  machine learning and AI  technologies to improve  manufacturing and  production efficiencies.  With an advanced  neural network, our AI  team is able to prevent  manufacturing challenges  that might cause  productivity, materials   and energy losses.” We work closely with our  customers to understand  their needs related to  cybersecurity, data  protection and product  safety, while also looking   at industry trends and   potential vulnerabilities. Specific areas of growing risk and vulnerability are the  internet of things and industrial internet of things. What  began as a means of machine-to-machine communication  has evolved into a complex system of millions of connected  devices worldwide, each of which represents a possible  attack point within a network. As a result of IoT growth, Micron’s innovation today focuses  not only on storage solutions for vast amounts of new data  but also on security for these IoT devices. The threat of  enterprise cyberattacks is far-reaching, given the potential  vulnerability and proliferation of embedded systems —  which are found in everything from automated equipment in  factories to automobiles and to smart home devices. As everyday smart devices become targeted network entry  points for cybercriminals, Micron’s Authenta™ technology  provides an extra layer of defense without adding new  components to an IoT platform. In addition, Authenta  memory components include cryptographic verification,  addressing growing concerns about counterfeiting or  tampering with electronics components. Almost all IoT  devices contain flash memory chips, and Authenta works by  protecting the software and data that run from those chips.  Imagine a typical house: If attackers can unlock the front  door, they gain access to everything inside. Authenta acts like additional keys that lock not only the front door but every  room within, providing an extra level of protection. This unique security solution increases Micron’s value as  a memory provider for IoT and connected devices across  the automotive, industrial and consumer markets. Micron’s  companion Authenta Key Management Service is a security- as-a-service platform that enables cloud activation and  identity verification of installed Authenta flash devices and  their platform software content at the edge. This capability  offers platform-level hardening and additional device  protection for our customer solutions. Technologies like Authenta build on Micron’s market and  industry leadership. We are an active member of the Trusted  Computing Group, an industry standards body that develops  and maintains the open standards and specifications for   self-encrypting drives (SEDs) and other trusted devices.   A decade ago, we launched one of the industry’s first solid- state SEDs intended for mobile computing and have since  developed drives that meet the rigorous Federal Information  Processing Standards. With safeguards like these, we  help ensure that the theft of a person’s device does not  necessarily mean theft of that person’s data. The assurance provided by memory and storage  products can’t stop with IT and operational technology  security. Some technology applications require  remarkably stable, reliable hardware to protect users.  This need is particularly true in the automotive sector,  where driver and pedestrian safety is critical and  where memory and storage solutions are vital to  enabling safe and efficient connected, autonomous  and electric vehicles. Micron has become the industry  leader in automotive memory and storage by helping  leading brands and tier 1 suppliers in their functional safety efforts. In addition to our work with Continental  AG on the DLA applications noted above, Micron has  made other investments:   Creating dedicated and experienced teams, such  as a functional safety office staffed with industry  safety veterans and safety experts, including  system architects and applications engineers for  collaboration support.   Adopting processes and methodologies across  Micron on the journey to comply with the ISO  26262 standard for the functional safety of  road vehicles. These activities include supplier- performed hardware evaluation reports and the  industry’s first independent assessment that  Micron’s automotive LPDDR5 is suitable for safety  systems up to ASIL-D, the highest level applied to  safety assurance.   Conducting extensive functional safety analysis and  providing collateral to simplify customer analysis. We focus on addressing risks  that products may pose to  customers, the environment  or society. Controlling Restricted Substances   Micron uses a range of potentially hazardous chemicals  and materials to transform wafers into individual die and  ensure product performance during use. These materials are  carefully regulated in many parts of the world. In addition to ensuring the safety of our people and  processes, our environmental, health and safety (EHS),  product compliance and global procurement functions work  together to ensure that Micron products and processes  meet legal and customer product-compliance requirements.  These include the European Union directive on the  Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances  (RoHS), the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and  Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and other lists of banned  or restricted substances. We also closely track substances that might be restricted  in the future. In the past decade, there has been a  regulatory shift from managing select hazardous chemicals  to managing classes of chemicals and their associated  hazards. As a result, Micron has teams of chemical engineers  in the U.S. and Asia dedicated to studying the structural  functional relationship of chemicals and their associated  regulatory environments. This research allows us to identify  emerging chemicals of concern and work to remove these  chemicals from substances and materials before they are  listed by customers or regulators. Being proactive in our  regulatory monitoring, product compliance, and validation  and certification processes allows us to deliver new products  quickly while ensuring proper restricted substance control  and conformance with requirements. Supplier engagement is also important in managing  restricted substances. Micron communicates our chemical- use expectations and restrictions to suppliers biannually  while training them to maintain programs on restricted  substance control. Supplier programs include regulatory  monitoring, chemical hazard assessment and substance  inventory monitoring. For suppliers who do not have all  the program elements, we provide support to help them  improve. Relevant suppliers are subject to risk assessment  and auditing of their restricted substance control processes. When new substances are added to regulatory lists, our  procurement team communicates new requirements  throughout our supply chain and reminds suppliers of  Micron’s expectations and applicable documentation. In  these instances, we require a prompt response from each  supplier regarding its use of any listed substances. We also  expect suppliers to monitor the candidate list for potential  inclusions in the REACH regulation and other applicable  requirements. When necessary, article suppliers must submit  necessary information to the Substance of Concern in  Products (SCIP) database. Complying With Global Trade   Laws & Regulations  As a responsible citizen in the global marketplace, Micron is  committed to adhering to all laws and regulations that relate  to export controls and trade compliance. Micron requires  its team members and representatives to conduct business  with the highest possible vigilance. We also mandate  compliance with export controls, import controls and  customs, economic sanctions and embargoes, and anti- boycott laws and regulations. Adhering to trade compliance laws and regulations is vital for  protecting the safety and security of the countries in which  Micron operates and for keeping our products, technology  and software out of the hands of people and organizations  that seek to do harm. As a global company, Micron’s commitment to trade  compliance initiatives ensures seamless support for our  major objectives, achievement of our key business strategies  and delivery of excellence for our customers. In 2020,  our compliance team responded quickly to fully comply  with evolving export control laws resulting from rapid and  dynamic changes in U.S.-China trade policy. Innovation, collaboration and tenacity are necessary as we drive  improvements in our energy, emissions, water and waste performance  throughout our operations. Transformative technology innovations — breakthroughs  in autonomous driving, big data processing, artificial  intelligence and more — are possible only through significant  improvements in memory and storage solutions. Increasing  the capacity and performance of these components can  unlock new possibilities for people and the planet. But these product improvements also require new  manufacturing equipment, materials and processing  technologies, which can intensify our operational footprint.  We are continually working to align our production with  objectives for both product and environmental performance  while also managing sometimes significant trade-offs. This balance begins in the early stages of planning  and process development, when we strive to identify  opportunities to reduce the effect of our operations on the  environment and in the communities where we’re located.  This analysis requires a blend of global strategy and local  adaptation, which we do through these activities: and construction. This integration includes evaluating  environmental sustainability improvements, such as  energy, water and waste efficiency; Leadership in Energy &  Environmental Design (LEED) criteria; and other opportunities  to improve our performance over time. “ Our products improve the  world by giving billions  of people the power  to access and store  information. We believe  these products should be  made sustainably. That’s  why we set aggressive  goals for emissions  reduction, renewable  energy, water use and  waste reduction to achieve  over the next 10 years.” As one of the world’s largest  semiconductor companies,  Micron understands that our  manufacturing operations  affect the environment, so we  take a proactive approach to  environmental stewardship. We build memory chips (or die) at our front-end facilities,  known as fabs, in Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and the United  States. Using state-of-the-art processes, we add and  subtract specialized materials to silicon wafers to create  our memory and storage solutions. This process takes  place at the nanoscale in a cleanroom environment. Each  wafer goes through numerous manufacturing steps, where  chemicals and materials are precisely applied to develop the  functionality of each chip. Airborne particles, temperature  and humidity are tightly controlled to ensure quality as the  wafer passes hundreds of times through up to 10 process  areas, each with a unique set of tools. From the moment a new wafer enters the fab until all steps  are finished, the process can take months. Once complete,  a wafer is divided into its constituent die, which are then  assembled at our assembly and test facilities into numerous  customized formats that enable many technologies. These  processes require energy to run specialized equipment and  maintain the cleanroom environment, use water to ensure the  cleanliness and quality of the wafer, and involve potentially  hazardous chemicals. Our application of Moore’s law has driven higher bit  density with each successive product generation while  requiring fewer resources and producing fewer emissions  per unit of production. No other industry is as efficient as  semiconductor manufacturing in this regard. For instance,  energy consumed per bit produced is improved by as much as 25% per year, and the cumulative effect over the decades  has been enormous. That said, innovation opportunities  abound to enhance environmental sustainability in  semiconductor manufacturing. To take advantage of these opportunities to innovate, we  are investing approximately US$1 billion over the next  five to seven years to adopt and co-develop leading-edge  technologies that further drive down our consumption of  resources and generation of byproducts. We are committed  to identifying and enabling these opportunities in partnership  with governments, academia, utility providers and members  of the broad manufacturing value chain. Micron is working  with our process and equipment solution providers to drive energy, material use and reaction efficiency and to  develop additional abatement techniques for unreacted  gases and chemicals. We are also working with equipment  manufacturers to promote advanced technologies that can  reduce total water use and enable us to reuse and recycle  more water. In addition, we are finding ways to repurpose  our waste to contribute to a circular economy. We will continue to dedicate significant resources in each of  these areas, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing  energy efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  and improving waste and water recycling infrastructure at  our global facilities. Our task is to innovate  boldly, not only to improve  our products but also to  accelerate sustainability. The semiconductor industry  faces great challenges to  reducing its operational  footprint. But these are  challenges that Micron  engineers and innovators are  uniquely positioned to solve. 2 degrees Celsius and with the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goal 13 on Climate Action. To be accountable for our performance, Micron has set  ambitious sustainability goals for the short and long terms.  These aspirations will dramatically improve the environmental  impact of our global operations while staying true to our vision  of enriching the world for all through technology innovation.  As a first step, we have set time-bound emissions, energy,  water and waste targets for calendar years (CY) 2025 and  2030. And, as we mentioned above, Micron plans to spend  approximately $1 billion over the next five to seven years on  our environmental programs to support these goals. A variety of innovative approaches will help us meet these  goals. For example, we are using artificial intelligence,  machine learning and the internet of things (IoT) to increase Note: Micron's environmental performance is measured by calendar year. Environmental goals are targeted for the end of the referenced calendar year. Finalizing contracts for new U.S. renewable energy development and engaging  with governments to increase the availability of renewable energy to support  our global manufacturing  Targeting conservation through enhancing our water reuse and recycle  infrastructure, as well as engaging in water restoration projects  50% water conservation  through reuse, recycling  and restoration efficiency in our fabs. We are designing for sustainability,  following LEED criteria in the construction of new facilities.  Over the next five years, operational sustainability will be  integrated into every technology development process,  and goals and solutions will be developed to drive us to  benchmark performance. A global, cross-functional team was convened to develop  our sustainability aspirations and has allowed us to share  insights across geographies so that we can make progress  in several areas at once. In addition, we have formed  specialized teams focused on heat transfer fluids, fluorinated  gases, energy efficiency and renewables, water and waste,  and other areas to support our goals. 36% reduction in GHG  emissions per unit of  production vs. Initiated negotiations  for new renewable  energy development and  procurement in the U.S. While Micron’s low-power  devices support sustainability  and climate change initiatives  in customer operations and  products, our manufacturing  process remains an energy-  and emissions-intensive one. Micron is tackling the challenge of energy and emissions  reduction head-on, with aspirations established early in  2020 to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 40% and  achieve 100% renewable energy where available worldwide.  We are updating these aspirations with two new time-bound  corporate targets:  Reduce GHG emissions 75% per unit of production   in 2030 (compared to a 2018 baseline)    Achieve 100% renewable energy in the U.S. by the   end of 2025 We also maintain our multiyear goal to achieve at least  10% energy savings (measured in kilowatt-hours saved  compared to 2016 baseline energy use) by 2022. To  achieve these goals, we are focusing first on areas where  our potential is greatest, including our energy use and  process gas emissions. Our approach to GHG management begins with collecting,  analyzing and reporting data specific to these emissions.  We report on GHG emissions through CDP, the primary  international organization standardizing environmental  data reporting on GHG emissions and other environmental  criteria for companies, cities, states and regions. In 2020,   we received a score of B on CDP’s climate list and a B on   its water security list, both improvements from prior   years’ scores. The semiconductor industry is also working to reduce  emissions of fluorinated GHGs (F-GHG), a potent source  of emissions that result from manufacturing processes.  Despite years of research into alternatives for F-GHGs,  few suitable substitutes exist for broad use. Micron is  continuously evaluating possibilities that are more efficient  or have lower potential for global warming. When no other  options are available, we also reduce F-GHGs through  point-of-use abatement at the tool level, where more than  90% of gases are destroyed. In terms of energy savings, we have saved a cumulative  7% compared to our 2016 baseline through projects  implemented in 2020. We are also taking the first steps  toward our renewable energy goal. In 2020, we began  negotiations to develop and procure new renewable  energy in the United States. In addition, we are installing  solar panels at facilities in Malaysia and Singapore and  will explore further opportunities for on-site solar as local  regulations allow. Micron is a member of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance  (REBA), a membership association for large-scale energy  buyers, developers, service providers and nongovernmental  organizations. In early 2021, we joined our REBA partners in  releasing a policy statement calling on the U.S. government  to enact national policy solutions that will accelerate the  transition to a zero-carbon power system by decarbonizing Note: Micron's environmental performance is measured by calendar year. Environmental goals are targeted for the end of the referenced calendar year. the grid and increasing federal funding for clean energy  technology research, development and demonstration. Achieving our GHG and energy goals requires incorporating  sustainability into our buildings from the ground up. We  consider sustainable building attributes — such as LEED  criteria, the world’s top rating system for green buildings —  as part of new building design. Many of our newest buildings  have achieved LEED Gold status, and we design and build  all new construction to meet or exceed that standard. To  improve the energy and emissions associated with existing  buildings, we are creating roadmaps to reductions over the  coming years. Because both new fab construction projects  and upgrades take years to design and implement, our plans  take a long-term view.  In the near term, we are implementing AI tools, smart control  systems and predictive maintenance to improve production  efficiency and automation. We have integrated 470,000  facility sensors into IoT platforms and control centers. And  we use a real-time performance monitoring platform with  video analytics, high-speed cameras, graphic units and deep  learning to conduct automated root-cause and corrective- action analyses. This platform, which enables us to quickly  resolve equipment downtime and process deviations, has led  to an 18% improvement in labor productivity, 50% reduction  in product downgrade, 22% improvement in time to new  product ramp and significant savings in energy consumption. 2018 7.95 Indexed Reduction per Unit of Production (% vs. CY18 baseline) 7.14 6.70 6.12 Micron deploys best environmental  management practices and efficiency  improvements that significantly  reduce GHG emissions per unit of  production. Production increases  result in GHG emissions growth. 6.10 .195 6.83 2.37 .194 2.27 8.56 Water is an essential  resource in the manufacture  of semiconductors. Each wafer used to make our products goes through a  series of cleaning steps, which depend on ultrapure water  to ensure manufacturing process quality. As semiconductor  technologies have become more complex, demand for water  has grown. Therefore, reducing the amount of water we  use and properly treating the water we do use are among  Micron’s top environmental priorities. Micron proactively manages water consumption by  identifying opportunities to increase water efficiency and  reduce raw water demand, supporting the U.N. Sustainable  Development Goal 6, which focuses on clean water and  sanitation. Our manufacturing sites generate ultrapure water  from a combination of recycled water from our operations  and local, untreated water resources. Wastewater from our  operations that is not recycled or otherwise reused on-site is  treated to comply with local standards and then discharged. We are working toward an aspirational goal of reusing,  recycling or restoring 100% of the water used in our  operations, with an interim goal of 75% by the end of 2030.  Actions such as enhancing reuse and recycling infrastructure  and managing water efficiency, especially at existing  facilities, will drive us toward this goal. Increasingly, we are  incorporating water saving measures during the design stage  of new buildings and industrial processes.   Sustainable management of our water footprint begins  with understanding where we obtain water. Globally, the  primary source for water at manufacturing locations is the  municipal supply, underscoring the importance of partnering  with local water authorities. We consider these relationships  within their local context, seeking to understand the  implications of different geographies, climates, watersheds  and infrastructure. We then use the information we have gathered to determine the best approach to water  management at each site. A water risk assessment using the World Resources  Institute’s Aqueduct tool has helped us better understand  local water conditions. Recent updates to Aqueduct note  that only 1% of Micron’s total water withdrawals come from  areas of high water stress — specifically our facility in Xi’an,  China. Still, many of our locations face potential water stress,  and we recognize the importance of being a good partner  in managing local water resources. Our fabs in Taiwan,  for example, have been designed to enable the highest  water recycling rates in the Micron network. A wastewater  reclamation system installed at our wafer fab in Taoyuan  in 2019 reduces our annual municipal water consumption  by over 450,000 cubic meters. As the location weathers a  historic drought, we are working closely with local authorities  and carefully managing our water use. Micron - Manassas, Virginia, U.S. Note: Micron's environmental performance is measured by calendar year. Environmental goals are targeted for the end of the referenced calendar year. While our approach to water stewardship reflects a local,  adaptive approach, our commitment to ensuring that  industrial wastewater discharges meet all environmental  legal requirements is global. Each Micron site has invested  in significant water treatment infrastructure so that any  wastewater leaving the site meets or exceeds applicable  water quality standards. Wastewater treatment methods  may vary by site but include membrane filtration, ion-resin  adsorption, precipitation, bio-oxidation and neutralization.  We routinely sample wastewater discharges for compliance  with environmental standards. In CY20, we discharged  42.4 million cubic meters of treated wastewater, with  85% of that discharge sent to publicly operated treatment  works. The sites also have staff responsible for the ongoing  operation and routine maintenance of wastewater systems to  safeguard proper performance over time. © Micron 2021 28 Boise, Idaho, U.S. One way Micron will achieve its water conservation goal is  by getting involved in local water restoration projects in the  communities where we operate. Boise State University’s  Intermountain Bird Observatory and Diane Moore Nature Center  is just across the Boise River from the pumphouse for Micron’s  headquarters and primary technology development fab, providing  a direct line of sight from one of Micron’s water sources to our  clean water goal. By “adopting” this stretch of the river, Micron will support the  restoration of a side channel that runs parallel to the river and  improve the quality of 10.9 million cubic meters of water a year.  If the main stem of a river is the highway, a side channel is the  service road where the traffic flows at a slower pace. In the case  of the Boise River, it is also where fish and wildlife can access  food, shelter and rest. The side channel provides cleaner, cold  water to target the higher dissolved oxygen needs of trout spawn  and juveniles. Micron is providing funding for the design and construction of the  project, which will reopen the side channel that has been filled in  over the years. This effort will offer an annual restoration benefit  equal to 21% of Micron’s 2020 global water withdrawals. Our  support will also allow Boise State University, a longtime partner,  to incorporate walking paths, signage and wildlife viewing areas  along the river. These amenities will engage visitors and bolster  community STEM education programs. The manufacturing  processes that transform  a wafer into hundreds of  individual die use chemicals  and materials such as  acids, bases and solvents  for depositing, patterning,  selectively removing and  cleaning. These processes  also create a variety of  waste materials. Micron maintains an active program to continually reduce  hazardous chemicals in the manufacturing process and  evaluate what we can do to mitigate any environmental  impacts stemming from our use of those chemicals. We also seek to reduce waste going into landfills and identify  new recycling opportunities for any waste we produce —  ultimately to meet our 2030 target of 95% waste reuse,  recycling and recovery on the way to our aspirational goal to  send zero waste to landfill. This commitment starts with a rigorous chemical review  process that ensures only approved chemicals reach  our facilities. This review prevents banned or restricted  chemicals from reaching our operations and facilitates  the proper handling, recycling and disposal of chemicals  throughout their lifecycle. It also allows us to track and  understand our chemical-use profile so that we can  implement chemical reduction and elimination initiatives.  Over the past year, we have increased our focus on chemical  reduction through process improvements, encouraging  teams to design waste out of their processes. Chemicals management also has critical intersections with workforce  safety and with our products. Beyond chemical screening, we perform due diligence  on all new waste vendors to make sure their practices  meet applicable legal requirements and safeguard the  surrounding environment. If a waste facility passes this  evaluation, Micron updates the assessment periodically to  support the consistent and effective management of waste  materials over time. Given our dynamic industry, we keep abreast of any new  risks or opportunities related to hazardous substances.  We are committed to reducing chemical consumption and Micron - Manassas, Virginia, U.S. Note: Micron's environmental performance is measured by calendar year. Environmental goals are targeted for the end of the referenced calendar year. waste production by identifying new segregation methods,  collaborating with waste vendors on solutions, optimizing  recipes to reduce chemical waste, and working with  business partners on reuse and recycling technology. For  example, facilities in many countries now divert treatment  plant byproducts for use as alternative raw materials in  other industries. We are also exploring technologies for  treating and reusing it in other Micron applications. Micron’s team members  care deeply about their  environment, especially as it  relates to the health and well- being of their communities.  Whenever possible, they put  their commitment into action. In 2020, Micron invited all team members to rally around our  new environmental goals by crowdsourcing a slogan that will  support engagement and awareness for our environmental  programs. Using an online collaborative innovation tool,  the initiative garnered immense support: More than 730  submissions were posted and more than 8,700 team  members across all Micron geographies participated.  Based on this input and executive review, the slogan Our  Memory. Our Planet. was born from a concept submitted by  a Micron team in Arzano, Italy. Our Memory highlights our  core business offering. Our Planet connects our business to  sustainable environmental practices. We’re also involving team members in other sustainability  work inside and outside Micron. We organized a virtual  Earth Day celebration in spring 2020 and launched our first  global environmental roundtable connecting grassroots  environmental teams across 21 manufacturing and  nonmanufacturing Micron locations. Roundtable members  represent committees of local volunteers who raise  awareness and engage peers on sustainability issues. Despite the challenges of COVID-19, volunteers came  together where it was safe to do so to care for their local  environments. Teams in Singapore, Taiwan and Japan  organized cleanups of nearby waterways. In Singapore  alone, nearly 850 team members gathered for 36 public  space cleanup sessions, volunteering 4,185 hours and  recovering 5,732 pounds of waste from the coastline. Taiwanese team member Solo Wu recruited colleagues  to help him monitor and protect the Nankan River from  pollution. Once a month, volunteers patrol and clean up  trash along a roughly 6-mile stretch of the river. “Biodiversity  in Nankan River has been growing over the years,” said Wu,  an environmental engineer for Micron’s EHS department  in Taoyuan. “We have observed multiple distinctive and  benchmark species. It indicates that patrol efforts are  effective and water quality is improving.” repurposing food scraps, electronics, furniture and more.   In Lehi, Utah, food waste collected from an on-site cafeteria  has been used by a recycling partner to produce natural gas  fuel, diverting 5.7 tons from the landfill in the first six months  of operation. The Boise, Idaho, team also established a new  program to reduce food waste by integrating compostable  cafeteria scraps into an on-site composting system. The  program recorded an average of 583 pounds a month of  waste diverted from the local landfill. “ We are fortunate to be  located near a company  that operates an anaerobic  digester that converts  food waste to biofuel.  Our ‘Scrape the Plate’  campaign allows all team  members and contractors  to participate in Micron’s  sustainability efforts. This  is an example of how small  and simple things can lead  to great results.” We are one link in an intricate technology supply chain that   spans the globe. By accelerating continuous improvement and promoting  transparency and collaboration, we can drive progress in  human rights and environmental stewardship across   our industry. Micron manages a complex supply chain that includes  a variety of materials, equipment and services required  to support our operations, from office supplies to highly  specialized design components. Given Micron’s 8,230  suppliers in 40 countries in 2020 and the changing sourcing  environment, managing our supply base is a critical and complex undertaking. Supplier geography continues to  diversify, which increases resilience but also complicates  the process of ensuring that all suppliers adhere to our  global standards. These challenges require a dedicated and tenacious  team to guide our supplier evaluation and approval  process and ensure that new and existing suppliers  meet our expectations, including those related to social  and environmental criteria. Micron works closely and  continuously with suppliers to assess risk, drive corrective actions and encourage improvement. We communicate  expectations to our tier 1 suppliers — those we source from  directly — through our supplier requirements standard,  previously known as our supplier quality requirements  document. Through this and other communications, we  strive to have responsible practices replicated throughout  our supply chain. $14.88B We monitor our global supply  network against supply  events 24/7, review possible  supply risk scenarios against  unplanned interruptions and  work with our supply base  to improve and lower their  overall risk profiles. Micron’s supply chain risk and resilience program has global  processes, partners with best-in-class, third-party risk service  providers, and has a team of highly skilled professionals in  place applying continuous improvement to ensure a resilient,  compliant and sustainable supply chain. Profiling and  managing the relative operational risks of each of our strategic  suppliers allow us to continuously manufacture and deliver  products to our customers while upholding industry and  Micron standards relating to sustainability.   Micron performs a supplier risk assessment that aligns with  one of our guiding documents, Integrity Matters: The Micron  Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and with the   RBA code of conduct. We evaluate the results of the  assessment to generate a risk score. We then require any  supplier with a high risk score or deficiency in a program   or process to develop plans to address the issues. In  addition, we expect suppliers to comply with or report to   the following:  RBA audit or equivalent for any facility identified as high risk    U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act    U.K. Bribery Act © Micron 2021 33   California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010    U.K. Modern Slavery Act of 2015  E.U. Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction  of Chemicals, updated and provided every six months or  as any product change requires    E.U. Restriction of Hazardous Substances, updated   and provided every 12 months or as any product   change requires As part of these assessments, Micron uses a software  system to make it easier to manage supplier inputs and  data. This practice improves the coverage, resources  and processes used to uphold high expectations for our  suppliers. In fiscal year 2020 (FY20), Micron assessed over  1,400 new suppliers, up from 900 in FY19. our supply chain. We also offer a training program focused  on responsibilities and expectations for our suppliers,  including Micron’s code of conduct, RBA requirements and  product compliance standards. More than 1,500 supplier  representatives, including new suppliers and incumbent  strategic partners, participated in this virtual training in  2020, and more than 3,500 have participated since FY18.  We also introduced a more tailored training for indirect  service and product suppliers that covers only training  topics relevant to their areas.   While compliance is an important aspect of a responsible  supply chain, Micron is evolving to reach beyond compliance  and toward greater engagement with suppliers. This  approach is particularly significant as we grow our business,  respond to evolving trade pressures around the world and  seek suppliers in new locations. In some areas, newer  businesses may not be familiar with industry standards  for suppliers such as the RBA code of conduct. We are  proactive in communicating our expectations and mitigating  risk up front, rather than having to correct issues later. As a result, in 2020, we introduced a new supplier onboarding  process incorporating increased due diligence. We use a  third-party partner to do background screenings and verify  all supplier data. If we uncover violations of our sourcing  standards, we give suppliers 30 days to address any gaps  — with Micron’s guidance — before they can be approved.  Otherwise, they are removed from our approved supplier list. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, close engagement   with suppliers has been essential. We shared the   Micron COVID-19 Playbook that we developed to guide  our internal response to the pandemic, helping suppliers  implement best practices and ensure safe workplaces.   We also sped up payments to small vendors so that they  could better manage financial challenges stemming from   the pandemic. We may develop a mitigation plan  and request improvement actions  of any suppliers found to be out of  compliance, or the suppliers may be  removed from our supply base. Micron  may establish corrective action plans,  conduct in-person training or develop  scorecard reviews or other plans to  improve suppliers’ risk profiles. Audit We initially assess suppliers using information from  business continuity processes, geographic location,  type of commodity or service, Micron’s history with the  supplier and third-party reviews. We conduct additional  screening for new suppliers. Suppliers identified as high risk may be audited in  person to ensure they comply with Micron’s code of  conduct. The COVID-19 pandemic limited the number  of audits we could conduct in 2020. We map suppliers at the manufacturing level, focusing  on business continuity planning processes, ethics,  location, forced labor, environment and safety. We  assign a score that indicates the risk of manufacturing  or business disruption, as well as a score that indicates  risk associated with responsibility and compliance. Each  score may be high, medium or low. Micron’s responsible sourcing and resilience group oversees  supply chain risk management, which includes environmental,  human rights and geopolitical risks. This team continues  to mature its mission of enabling a resilient, compliant  and sustainable global supply chain, including screenings,  assessments, investigations, risk profiling, development and  auditing of new and incumbent suppliers. Micron and our stakeholders  support the advancement of  human rights along our   value chain. The Micron Code of Business Conduct and Ethics aligns  with the RBA code of conduct and explicitly highlights our  commitment to respecting and protecting human rights  wherever we operate. Micron actively works to uphold the  highest level of labor ethics in our own operations, and we  also expect our suppliers, contractors and other partners to  adhere to our code, human rights policy and relevant laws,  with a particular emphasis on child labor and forced labor. Our commitment to these concerns is made public through  our slavery and human trafficking statement, which was  updated and approved by Micron’s board of directors for  FY20. As part of our ongoing due diligence in this area, we  regularly conduct supplier risk assessments to understand  how well suppliers address the issues, with specific focus  on operations in areas more at risk for human rights  violations. Beyond these important issues, Micron also  monitors the following human rights concerns as they relate  to our supply chain: This oversight of human rights begins with anyone who works  on a Micron site in any capacity, from security to construction  work. It extends to the employees of our suppliers and to  any people hired temporarily by suppliers, who in some parts  of the world are foreign migrant workers. Many of Micron’s suppliers are located in Asia, which has areas that are at  higher risk for human rights violations against foreign migrant  workers and require additional diligence. For example,  workers may have their passports withheld or be charged  recruiting or administrative fees before being hired. These  fees can amount to more than several months’ pay and may  require workers to take out loans, effectively forcing them to  pay to have a job. In addition, most of these workers send  the majority of their earnings back to their home countries to  support their families, making the payment of loans and fees  especially burdensome.  RBA code requirements limiting forced labor differ from  the laws regarding fees, levies and working hours in many  countries where we do business. While the variations add  complexity, we enforce the more stringent standard if local  laws and the RBA code are different. Micron is actively  involved, along with other members of the RBA, in eliminating  forced labor in our supply chain through training, dialogue  with government officials and interviews with foreign migrant  workers about their conditions. To avoid forced labor  practices, Micron also works with recruitment agents in the  countries of hire to make sure they follow proper procedures. We are an active member of the Responsible  Business Alliance (RBA). The RBA is composed  of leading electronics, retail, automotive and toy  companies that have joined together to promote  responsible working conditions, ethical business  practices and environmental stewardship globally  throughout their respective industry supply chains.  The RBA plays a critical role in upholding a single set  of expectations regarding social and environmental  responsibility and a single process for demonstrating  conformance. Members adhere to a common RBA  code of conduct, which addresses supply chain  performance expectations for labor, health and safety,  environmental practices, ethics and management  systems. Through RBA training materials, monitoring  tools and third-party audits, we support the efforts of  our key suppliers to maintain responsible operations.  We also hold suppliers accountable when they fall  short of expectations. To comply with the RBA code  in our own operations, we have adopted a vigorous  management approach that includes training our  team members on code requirements and using third- party auditors to verify our actions. Our global RBA  oversight team includes representatives from legal,  human resources, environmental, health and safety,  and supplier management functions. They monitor  key RBA metrics across all of our manufacturing  locations and review periodic reports on Micron’s  overall RBA performance. Micron has long been  a leader in programs to  address and report on  conflict minerals. Like many  technology companies,  Micron relies on the use of  tin, tungsten, tantalum and  gold (3TG) in the manufacture  of our products. These materials, known as conflict minerals, are abundant  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and  surrounding countries, a region that has endured sustained  conflict and human rights violations. We recognize that these  and other raw materials are subject to controversy based  on social and environmental concerns regarding how they  are obtained. With this in mind, our program assesses and  reviews other rare earth elements, metals and materials  used in our processes to understand global risks related to  human rights, potential restrictions, availability, pricing and  implications to manufacturing processes and products while  focusing expanded due diligence on worldwide 3TG minerals. Micron is committed to ensuring that minerals used in the  manufacture of our products do not directly or indirectly fund  violence or human rights abuses in the DRC or adjoining  countries. We have adopted a goal of sourcing entirely  from smelters and refiners validated by third-party audits  as conforming with the Responsible Minerals Initiative  (RMI) Responsible Minerals Assurance Process or similar  cross-recognized programs from the Responsible Jewellery  Council or London Bullion Market Association (LBMA). To  this end, we seek to align with international best practices on  due diligence set forth in the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development’s Due Diligence Guidance  for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals From Conflict- Affected and High-Risk Areas and comply with Section 1502  of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act, which requires publicly traded U.S.  companies to track, monitor and report annually on conflict  minerals in supply chains. Collaboration among government, industry and communities  is key to achieving conformance in our supply chain.  Reflecting this philosophy, Micron is a founding member  of the RMI, a consortium that works across the minerals  industry to develop a common approach for addressing  conflict mineral supply chains and protocols that may  expand to include other minerals. The RMI includes a third- party auditing process, due diligence tools and a public  database documenting where each smelter or refiner stands  in its conflict-free journey. Micron is a member of the RMI’s  smelter engagement working group and has supported  expansion of the RMI’s cobalt reporting program, which we  expect to be implemented in 2022. Because Micron does  not produce batteries, we do not use significant amounts of  cobalt. Even so, we have investigated potential cobalt use  within our supply chain. Micron implements policies and procedures to help ensure  that our existing suppliers rely on smelters and refiners that  are conflict-free, and we only engage with new suppliers that  make similar commitments. We require suppliers to remove  nonconformant smelters within 13 weeks when they fall out  of approved status, but they often resolve issues sooner. Throughout 2020, all the smelters and refineries in Micron’s  supply chain conformed with responsible minerals sourcing  standards. We are committed to transparency and publish  an annual conflict minerals report on our due diligence and  progress toward a conflict-free supply chain. As an industry leader, Micron  has significant opportunity to  partner across our industry to  influence the environmental  profile of suppliers. A limited number of equipment manufacturers supply  the technologies used in Micron’s plants and those of  our peers. Micron steers the industry toward innovations  that reduce water and energy use. And we also help our suppliers to understand our sustainability efforts and to  identify and address sustainability-related risks, including  those pertaining to climate change and other environmental  impacts. In much the same way as we assess suppliers for  risk, we survey high-risk and critical suppliers’ programs to  improve energy efficiency; reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs);  and control, treat and minimize solid waste, wastewater  and air emissions. The RBA audit process used with our  suppliers assesses these impacts. We also require that key suppliers report to CDP, either by  sending Micron their CDP submissions or reporting a subset  of CDP information. We plan to expand our environmental engagement through a formal partnership with the CDP  supply chain program in 2021. Beyond encouraging  suppliers to disclose their direct carbon footprints, we are  working with them to find ways to reduce environmental  impacts at Micron sites. In 2020, we piloted a program with  a targeted group of capital equipment suppliers to identify  how they could support Micron’s internal environmental  goals related to energy, emissions, water and waste. We  now have a tracking system for projects supporting these  goals and are establishing timelines and milestones to keep  us moving forward. We have deep experience interacting with  supply chain partners as both a supplier  and a customer, and we are subject to  many of the same auditing protocols  that our own suppliers are. All Micron  sites have qualified for RBA platinum  recognition with perfect audit scores.  In addition, Micron Memory in Taiwan  received the Factory of Choice award  from the RBA in 2020. We believe the best innovation  comes from diverse  experiences, perspectives and  backgrounds, and this belief  extends to our supply chain  and procurement programs. Micron’s supplier diversity program is helping us build  mutually beneficial partnerships with businesses that are  majority-owned by women, underrepresented communities,  people with disabilities, members of the LGBT community,  and veterans. In 2020, we set an ambitious commitment to  double Micron’s annual spend with these businesses by FY23.  Progress toward this goal will be measured against an FY20 baseline in spending with such businesses globally and made  possible by our continued engagement with industry groups,  nongovernmental organizations and corporate peers. In 2020, we implemented new tools and processes that will  allow us to find diverse suppliers more easily and increase  their opportunities to participate in Micron’s procurement  events. We also revised expectations for suppliers,  including supporting Micron’s supplier diversity initiative  and committing to use inclusive sourcing practices of their  own. In addition, we incorporated tier 2 supplier diversity  and reporting requirements into our supplier scorecards and  evaluated a targeted group of our strategic partners on their  reporting of tier 2 diverse spend. semiconductor industry. Micron recently joined the National  Minority Supplier Development Council, which aims to  advance business opportunities for certified minority- owned businesses based in the United States. Outside  the U.S., Micron is working with WEConnect International  to identify and increase opportunities for women-owned  businesses throughout Asia. Micron is also a member  of the SEMI Manufacturing Ownership Diversity working  group, which seeks to increase ownership diversity in the  semiconductor supply chain. These partnerships reflect our  long-term commitment to advocating for supplier diversity  around the world. “ In FY20, Micron spent   over $104 million  with diverse-owned  businesses. To ensure  continued progress,  we are committing to  doubling our spend   with diverse businesses  by FY23.” A thriving workplace requires focused effort. People are the backbone  of our business and critical to our vision of transforming how the world  uses information to enrich life for all. Micron depends on a hardworking, tenacious and highly  educated workforce to design, develop and manufacture  high-quality, cutting-edge memory and storage solutions.  Our employees (called team members for the importance of  their collaboration) are located in 17 countries. So creating a  unified culture across functions and geographies is essential  to realizing Micron’s vision and mission. The challenges of 2020 reaffirmed a fundamental truth:  Nothing is more important than our people. While Micron has  always had a strong human resources team, we recognized  the need to shift to a comprehensive people strategy that  reflects just how vital Micron’s people are to the business  and how highly we regard our team members. We have  also elevated the position of chief people officer (CPO) to  Micron’s executive leadership team. © Micron 2021 40 Micron - Boise, Idaho, U.S. Our new people and culture organization has introduced a  mission to be a top company to work for by investing in our  people, strengthening our communities and investing for the  future. We will achieve this mission with efforts in three areas:  Focusing on our people and our influence on the  community. Innovation requires diverse perspectives at the  table. That’s why we’re committed to building a diverse  pipeline of people who not only contribute to their local  communities, but also drive progress for the world at large.    Enabling the workforce of the future. We’re creating the  next generation of trailblazers by actively investing in the  professional development of our talent. By cultivating an  inclusive culture, we’re able to continue growing our talent  at all levels.  Transforming the work experience. We embrace change.  Using technologies like artificial intelligence, machine  learning, data analytics and other tools, we’re able to  evolve and create the best experience working at Micron. Over the short and long terms, our people and culture  organization will focus on priorities in each of these areas,  bringing us closer to our vision. “ In partnership with  our global leaders, our  incredible people team  is continually looking for  new ways to strengthen  our culture that fosters  inclusion for all.” Finding and retaining the  best and brightest people  in an extremely competitive  industry environment is a  strategic imperative for   our business. Work in our three strategic focus areas begins even before  prospective employees become part of the Micron team.  Our talent acquisition group works to build a diverse,  global workforce by enhancing our employment brand and  strengthening recruitment efforts at universities and with  diverse candidates. We have partnerships with more than  300 colleges and universities worldwide. In collaboration with  these institutions, we offer curricula and mentorship programs  that reinforce awareness of and engagement with Micron  among students and graduates. To connect with candidates  from diverse backgrounds, Micron is strengthening our efforts  at historically Black colleges and universities and Hispanic- serving institutions, and we’re also working with organizations  such as the Society of Women Engineers. Micron is increasing hiring — and therefore representation  — of diverse candidates through a new set of practices.  These include hiring practices where we build a diverse  slate of qualified candidates and ensure that interview  panels themselves are diverse. In addition, we use  artificial intelligence to draft job descriptions to reduce or  eliminate the potential for bias, and we remove identifiable  information from résumés, minimizing any distractions  from personal characteristics to instead focus on individual  merit. Micron’s legal department has adopted the Mansfield  Rule, which means it will consider at least 50% historically  underrepresented lawyers for 70% or more of its high- visibility opportunities, internal promotions, significant  leadership roles, and outside counsel representation for a  two-year period. Knowing that bias can unconsciously influence hiring  decisions, volunteers from our employee resource groups  have been trained to participate on interview panels as  inclusion advocates to deter bias. The advocate listens  carefully and challenges unfair assumptions to ensure hiring  decisions are made fairly. Measuring Team Member Engagement   People who are engaged at work tend to thrive  professionally, and our performance is better as a result.  Micron participates in the Great Place to Work survey, which  solicits feedback from our global team members on their  experiences at the company. This information allows us to  identify strengths and areas of opportunity, as well as to  benchmark our performance against other companies. We are proud of our results, which improved in a number  of key areas compared to 2019. For example, 94% of  employees agreed that Micron is a physically safe place  to work, which was especially meaningful in light of the Micron - Boise, Idaho, U.S. 2020 pandemic. Micron was certified as a Great Place to Work in  seven countries and made the Best Workplace list in four  countries in 2020. Improving Team Member Retention  Creating an environment where team members can thrive  enhances our ability to retain the best talent. Micron  historically has low turnover, even at locations with fierce  competition for top talent. We have seen a 6% rate of  voluntary turnover in fiscal year 2020 (FY20), down 1% from  FY19. This trend was observed across all three geographical  regions where Micron operates, with the biggest  improvement in Asia. That said, Micron is focused on improving the retention rate  for our female team members. Many companies including  Micron experienced a decline in turnover due to COVID-19.  This coupled with our efforts to retain diverse talent through  targeted programs resulted in a 0.6% decrease in the gender  retention gap from 2019. People here  are treated fairly  regardless of   their gender. 94%  This is a  physically   safe place   to work. 84%  Taking  everything into  account, I would  recommend Micron  as a Great Place   to Work. People here  are treated fairly  regardless of  their sexual  orientation. People here  are treated fairly  regardless of   their race. We encourage our team members to seek balance between  their work and home lives. Micron follows Responsible  Business Alliance (RBA) standards on working hours,  which state that employees in all functions should work no  more than 60 hours a week (typical in some international  manufacturing environments), except in emergency or  unusual situations, with at least one day off every seven  days. We also offer flexible work arrangements and  compressed work weeks for manufacturing team members  so they can manage work and life. Our total compensation strategy includes base salary, annual  bonuses and equity awards. Taken as a whole, Micron’s  compensation programs are designed to support our team  members’ financial and personal well-being by providing a  valuable return for their contributions to the company. We  also offer a discounted stock purchase program, allowing  team members to purchase Micron stock at a 15% discount  in most of the markets where we operate. They can enroll in  the program twice a year and contribute up to 10% of their  salary. When the program was reinstated at Micron in August  2018, about 53% of our workforce opted to participate. In  2020, that participation increased to 65%.  Military differential pay to offset the difference in pay for  eligible team members who are performing voluntary or  involuntary service in the U.S. uniformed services    Professional development opportunities and financial  assistance for team members seeking to advance their  education in a traditional university setting In 2020, we expanded these benefits in the U.S. to offer an  adoption benefit, fertility benefits and coverage for team  members’ domestic partners. We also enhanced gender  confirmation services covered under the medical plans and  added benefits for backup child care and elder care. We  modified our U.S. holiday calendars to incorporate floating  holidays that team members can use as they wish, provided  an additional paid wellness day and facilitated a charity  event in which team members could cash out or donate  vacation days to help others affected by COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded  medical benefits and leave-of-absence programs. No-cost  telehealth benefits were added to all U.S. medical plans to  give team members access to medical and mental health  services at home while doctors’ offices were closed and  hospitals were at capacity. Similar telemedicine services  were implemented in Singapore so that team members there  could avoid waiting at clinics, and medical insurance policies  in Malaysia were enhanced to provide better coverage. In  India, Micron enhanced the insurance policy exclusively for  COVID-19 treatment on top of standard insurance benefits  and sponsored COVID-19 testing for all Micron team  members there.  Micron also addressed financial challenges related to the  pandemic, including providing a global COVID-19 assistance  payment and pledging no layoffs for 90 days in the early  stages of the pandemic. To help U.S. team members adjust,  Micron adopted several 401(k) and flexible spending account  COVID-19 provisions. We also instituted an assistance  fund to deliver additional financial help to team members  facing extreme hardships. It is funded primarily by Micron  team members and gives one-time grants of US$500 to  eligible team members who apply. We have now broadened  the scope of the fund to help team members experiencing  hardships and emergencies not related to COVID-19 with  grants up to US$5,000. Safety protocols to prevent community spread of COVID-19  required a swift work-from-home transition for many of our  team members. In response, we offered several resources:    Hardware productivity kit and home office equipment and  furniture reimbursements offered to all team members who  shifted to working remotely As a multinational company,  Micron knows that real  innovation comes from our  team members’ distinct  experiences, perspectives  and backgrounds. In 2020, Micron updated our corporate vision statement, adding  two small but important words to the end: Transforming how  the world uses information to enrich life for all. This powerful  and intentional change builds on Micron’s brand promise  and highlights our ongoing commitment to diversity, equality  and inclusion (DEI). “For all” embodies not just who we are  but also what we do. DEI is essential throughout our business. Our customers  expect us to collaborate with them to solve real human problems. Our investors expect our board to represent a  diverse set of experiences and views. Our communities  expect us to advocate for equitable laws and accessible  education that benefits everyone. Our people expect to   work in an inclusive culture where all voices are heard and  the best ideas win. We know that diversity can be both visible and invisible,  so we foster a culture of inclusion and equality in which all  team members can grow and thrive. While we have made  great progress, our achievements to date don’t represent  our sense of urgency. We are making powerful commitments  for 2021, launching targeted programs to support our  underrepresented team members in their advancement at  all levels of the company. Because we believe transparency  promotes accountability, each year we affirm our  commitment by publishing our DEI report. This year’s report,  titled “For All: 2020 Annual Report,” highlights our DEI  strategy, recognizes our successes and calls attention to  areas that need improvement. While most of Micron’s team members are located outside  the United States, our DEI efforts to date have been more  U.S.-focused than representative of our global workforce.  In FY20, we addressed this situation by expanding our DEI  team in Asia and naming a senior leader based in Singapore  who will oversee our DEI business partners and collaborate  with global leaders. We are also putting in place regional DEI  strategies for each of our locations. In addition, we have set goals for inclusive hiring and work  practices, with specific focus areas for all regions. For  example, our teams in Japan and Malaysia are working  to hire women and people with disabilities, while Japan is  emphasizing hiring foreign nationals. In India, Micron’s talent  acquisition team has ramped up recruitment of new female  college graduates for engineering roles. Our talent acquisition, university relations, DEI, workforce  development and other teams work closely to guide inclusive  hiring efforts and ensure development and advancement  opportunities for all. We continue to make progress on  women’s representation in leadership positions. In FY20,  our board of directors was 37.5% female, growing to  50% female representation in February 2021. Female © Micron 2021 44 Micron - Boise, Idaho, U.S. representation in our senior leadership team grew from  13.5% in FY19 to 14.2% in FY20. Micron is developing a strong pipeline of female technical  talent through a global women’s mentoring program that  connects early-career engineering talent with our senior  leadership. In FY20, 33% of the participants in our FY19  advance sponsorship cohort were promoted, including two  who became vice presidents in technical areas. We continue  to more broadly promote women in the technology industry  through our partnerships with organizations such as the  Global Semiconductor Alliance. Another area of DEI progress addresses our team members  with disabilities, a self-reported group that grew by nearly  4% in FY20. Our Malaysia sites successfully launched  a program to recruit and train 20 new technicians with hearing impairments. The Malaysia team partnered with an  external agency and marshalled internal resources to create  an inclusive environment for these new team members  through staff training in sign language and light-based  notification systems. Micron has also raised awareness of visible and invisible  disabilities globally through our new Capable employee  resource group and campaigns such as World Mental Health  Day. Because disability data is self-reported, we believe  that increasing cultural acceptance helps our global team  members feel more comfortable being open about their  disability status. 37.5% 14.2% 75.0% 62.5% 86.5% 85.8% 37.5% increased to 50% in 2021 2.2% LGBTQ+ 7.2% Living With   Disabilities  5.9% U.S. Veterans 25.0% Female Male 14.2% 13.5% We have a regular review of pay globally, including base pay  and stock awards, to drive compensation equitability. Micron  works with a third party and uses dynamic technology to  analyze and adjust when needed. Historically, our pay equity analyses have focused on  gender. We have expanded our scope to assess all  underrepresented groups: women and people with  disabilities globally, and veterans, Black Americans and  Hispanic Americans in the U.S. As a result of our analyses,  in FY20, we increased Micron’s minimum wage to $15 an  hour for all U.S. team members. Much like the inclusion advocates who participate in  candidate interviews, team member advocates also  participate in talent review meetings to ensure that decisions  regarding promotions, performance, rotation assignments,  access to training and other advancement opportunities are  determined fairly. Strengthening Our Culture of Inclusion   Employee resource groups (ERGs) are an important part of  our talent pipeline and our work to build a more inclusive  culture. ERGs are employee-led and volunteer-driven groups  centered around people with shared identities or experiences  and their allies. Micron has nine ERGs with 74 chapters  at our sites around the world. We saw an 84% growth in  overall ERG membership in 2020 and the creation of 25 new  chapters, including 10 in the U.S. and 15 in Asia. Micron is empowering ERG members even more by aligning  their work more closely to our business objectives. For  example, the Micron Women’s Leadership Network (MWLN)  ERG and Micron patent team began the Women’s Innovation  Network in 2019 to mentor women inventors. As a result, the  number of female inventors at Micron increased from 77 in  2019 to 136 in 2020. ERGs engage both members and nonmembers in creative  ways. For example, the PRIDE+ Allies, Black Employee  Network (BEN) and Micron Hispanic Professionals ERGs  held inclusion ally training to help all Micron team members  understand the importance of allyship. Nearly 1,000 team  members participated in this training. For FY21, all ERGs  have developed their own training, with a goal of all 40,000  Micron team members participating in at least one session,  an activity that is tied to the company’s short-term incentive  goals. Taking this a step further, we created a new inclusion  ally award, given quarterly to recognize exceptional allyship  among team members. Awards have been given for standing  up against microaggressions and creating hiring initiatives  aimed at women and people with disabilities.  Other efforts by ERGs to promote inclusion include Micron’s  first commemoration of Juneteenth, led by our BEN  ERG in the United States. The group organized a day of  education with a virtual fireside chat, panel discussions and  opportunities for small-group meetings among teams about  the prejudices faced by Black Americans. In June, members  of PRIDE+ Allies raised the Pride flag at three Micron  sites. And our Capable ERG has partnered with our senior  leadership team, facilities and IT staff to explore technology  resources for team members with varying abilities. Such  resources include smart badges and translations of video  calls. In addition to these specific efforts, the DEI team has  also focused on creating strong dialogue with community  leaders and police officers. Advocating for Racial & LGBTQ+ Equality  We have the power to promote social justice beyond the  walls of our company. Micron’s new social justice council  is determining how best to promote racial equality and  LGBTQ+ rights in the communities where our team members  live, work and play. For example, we are actively engaging  with community and law enforcement leaders at our largest  U.S. sites to identify systemic issues and take action to  move our communities forward. We are training local  municipalities and police departments where Micron has a  presence in DEI behaviors, and we will partner with other organizations to advance the use of data and technology  to influence the criminal justice system and create greater  transparency in law enforcement. In addition, the Micron Foundation is promoting social  justice with a recent Advancing Curiosity award to the  eScience Institute’s Data Science for the Social Good  program at the University of Washington. During the summer,  a team developed new methods for detecting dilution of  minority votes and created an open-source tool to identify  coronavirus disinformation on news websites. Engaging With Minority-Owned Financial  Institutions for Cash Management  Another way Micron uses our strength and resources to drive  lasting change is through the firms we choose to manage  our capital investments. Throughout 2020, Micron allocated  $250 million in cash and cash equivalents to be managed by  minority-owned firms, which has a multiplying effect in the  economies of underrepresented communities. This effort includes allocating $100 million for management  under Academy Securities, a veteran-owned firm, and $100  million under Ramirez Asset Management, Inc., an affiliate  of Samuel A. Ramirez & Company, Inc. which is the oldest  and largest Hispanic-owned investment bank in the U.S. A  final $50 million allocation to RBC Global Asset Management  will support an impact investment strategy that aims to  reduce wealth gaps in predominantly Black neighborhoods  and increase access to homeownership, affordable rental  housing, community facilities and small business loans. 10  in U.S. Proactive efforts to prevent  occupational illnesses   and injuries allow us to  maintain a safe, healthy   and secure workplace. Our safety vision is straightforward: We strive for an incident- free workplace. Micron already has a tradition of world-class  safety performance, but making further improvements requires  dedicated effort, resources, commitment and tenacity, and it  involves everyone at every level of our organization. Across our  business, Micron is evolving safety to a value so embedded in  our culture that it becomes instinctual. Our manufacturing locations are certified to ISO 45001:2018  safety and occupational health management systems,  setting a foundation for an effective and auditable safety  program. In early 2020, we introduced a new program known  as Live Safe to move us from a compliance-based to a more  proactive, risk management-based approach to safety. Live  Safe creates a unified corporate safety culture by engaging  managers at all levels, identifying program champions,  establishing a formal training structure and common safety  practices across our global facilities, and reinforcing critical  technical programs that focus on fundamental hazards that  our team members may face. The program rollout coincided  with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. While this timing  required us to adapt training to be delivered virtually, it also  created a proving ground that empowered team members  to own their personal safety — and senior leaders to show  their care and concern for the safety of our team members,  contractors and vendors. One of the tenets of our safety methodology — and our  COVID-19 response — is to “coach and be coached.”  Our teams showed both leadership and humility as we  ramped up global safety protocols, allowing us to see the  effectiveness of this mindset in action. Micron - San Jose, California, U.S. Safety is not a lack of incidents. Rather, safety is the sum of  actions we take that help prevent incidents from occurring.  As part of the Live Safe program, we have strengthened our  safety key performance indicators and established a set  of leading indicators — proactive actions we take to keep  us all safe. We have also implemented leader-led, activity- focused key performance indicators that better measure  management behaviors and engagement for safety, as well  as enhancements to our technical safety program. For example, all leaders in manufacturing participate in  regular area safety assessments where they walk through  their work environments looking for unsafe conditions  and behaviors. They also participate in behavioral safety  assessments in which they observe their teams at work and  share constructive feedback, including correcting unsafe  behaviors. When issues are identified through an area safety  walk or a behavioral assessment, we track corrections and  timely closeouts. We also track that team members complete  all required safety training. *Management systems at all of Micron’s manufacturing  sites cover employees and nonemployee workers.  Approximately 84% of Micron team members are  assigned to manufacturing locations. 2018 0.32 Rates are based on 200,000 hours worked.  Starting in 2020, contractors are included in the recordable injury rate. While we are proud of this performance, we recognize that  we can do even more, knowing that serious injuries can  happen even with a low recordable injury rate. To this end,  we are strengthening our focus on serious injury prevention  by tracking potential and real life-altering injuries. These  injuries are often associated with our nine critical risks. We aim to reduce these serious injuries by placing ownership  on each site leader. If an incident occurs on a Micron site,  we require leaders to take action to help prevent a similar  incident in the Micron network. Our goal is to reach zero life- altering injuries by FY22. Ensuring Safe Use of Chemicals   in Manufacturing   Micron is an industry leader in the responsible use  of chemicals, gases and byproducts that are part of  manufacturing. We focus on protecting our team members  by identifying chemical hazards through a rigorous approval  process, eliminating or substituting these substances,  implementing engineering controls, and providing information  about hazards to team members through training. As  appropriate, we provide team members with personal  protective equipment and conduct regular medical checks  and monitoring for concentrations of hazardous substances. Micron has implemented a risk-based approach of  analyzing and controlling hazards for the lifecycle  of hazardous chemicals and gases. A global team,  coordinating with local teams at each manufacturing  and technology development site, provides training,  assesses risk, mitigates hazards and responds to  incidents. Worldwide teams work closely with all elements  of manufacturing, including leadership, equipment and  engineering teams, and fab support and facilities personnel. These teams follow a risk-based program developed by  the Center for Chemical Process Safety. It is built on 20  elements that are essential to a successful process safety  strategy. To discover and mitigate any safety concerns on  fab workstations and facilities systems, teams primarily use  a risk assessment tool known as a hazard and operability  study (HAZOP). Worldwide, Micron team members have  completed over 1,000 HAZOPs since 2010. Maintaining a Safe & Healthy Workplace  During COVID-19   As Micron has responded to the global spread of COVID-19,  the past year has tested us in countless ways. It has also  shown us the importance of preparation, teamwork and  willingness to adapt our plans as a situation evolves. Micron’s safety protocols often went well beyond local,  state and federal requirements. In most Micron locations,  our response to COVID-19 began before the first case of  the virus was detected. As a global company, we conduct  planning related to emergencies of all types, including  pandemics and infectious diseases. We have navigated  localized epidemics near our facilities in Asia in the past,  so we had protocols ready to deploy when the first cases  were reported and the virus began to spread. Our pandemic  emergency preparedness plan (PEPP) provided the  framework for our response, outlining risk-based categories  that could be applied uniformly to mitigate risk and keep  workers safe at our sites worldwide. As COVID-19 spread, several groups acted swiftly,  procuring masks and other personal protective equipment  and overseeing the adaptation of our work practices. We  also quickly developed contact tracing procedures, using  technology such as wearable devices that allowed us to  rapidly determine team members’ exposure risk. The global process safety and hazard review team is now  leading a project to build a database of safety-critical  information for all the gases and chemicals used at  Micron. Through partnerships with process and equipment  engineering teams, our efforts continue to reduce overall risk  for our manufacturing and technology development sites. Micron also takes a long-term approach to eliminating the use  of high-hazard materials from the workplace and from our  products, working across our industry to develop alternatives  with lower risk. Although these are not regulatory requirements  for Micron in most countries, we view this as a best practice  that positions Micron as an industry leader to ensure the  safety of our team members and their communities. it was essential that we adopt safe distancing and  cleaning protocols that would allow our business to  continue operating. Micron developed dynamic plans for  how individuals could move safely through each of our  facilities. We also upgraded HVAC systems and installed  bipolar ionization technology that effectively removes the  coronavirus from a building’s air flow. With COVID-19  vaccines now available, we have launched a task force to  monitor vaccine availability for team members. More than a year after the outbreak began, we are proud of  our approach and our ability to protect more than 40,000  team members in 17 countries while maintaining our global  operations. Micron continues to adapt on-site work protocols  to prioritize the health and safety of our team members. We  carefully assess risk in each location to protect our teams  and support business needs. The return of team members to  Micron sites will be based on a range of considerations, such  as virus prevalence, location, job role and business needs.  Meanwhile, we continue to enforce the strong preventative  measures we implemented at our sites from the start of the  COVID-19 outbreak and deploy new protocols as needed to  promote safety. Creating an injury- and  illness-free workplace is a  minimum expectation, but it  is only one aspect of Micron’s  efforts to keep team members  safe and healthy at work. A focus of our well-being and benefits teams in 2020 was  using every possible means to deliver robust mental and  emotional health services, tools and resources to team  members and their families. However, ensuring well-being  amid the uncertainty of COVID-19 went well beyond helping  team members cope with challenges. Several existing programs were enhanced to provide more  services or modified from an in-person delivery to a virtual  environment. We created new roles for team member  advocates, a resource we launched in 2019, to provide a  single place where team members could turn for advice  on challenges related to careers, family, finances, health  and other concerns. We also expanded our Choose Well,  Live Well program, one that combines site-level and global  assistance, in these meaningful ways:  Adding financial tools and work-life coaching for U.S.  team members, and stress, anxiety and depression  programming globally    Providing critical-incident stress management services  and emotional support sessions for team members dealing  with the trauma of social justice events Micron - Manassas, Virginia, U.S. “ Wellness is much more  than just cardiovascular  and physical health. It’s  also about mental and  emotional well-being.  Knowing that resources  are just a phone call away  has helped team members  manage stress from the  COVID-19 pandemic.” To attract and retain people  with exceptional capabilities,  we invest in the ongoing  learning and development of  our team members, fostering  a work environment that  inspires creativity, leadership  and collaboration. Using a “learn and grow” approach, we create an  environment where team members and leaders are  inspired to grow, empowered to learn and connected to  resources and opportunities that nurture personal growth  and performance. We encourage them to choose their own  development priorities and take initiative in using resources  that Micron provides to advance their personal development. Micron’s primary program for assessing performance  and promoting professional development is called Reach  Performance. This program encourages higher levels of  performance by establishing clear individual performance  expectations, supporting team member development and  enabling leaders to be better coaches. It begins with setting  individual goals through conversations, progresses through  periodic check-ins and culminates with feedback and  performance analyses. At every step along the way, Micron  strives to create a high-performance culture that is motivating  and to inspire and empower team members to do their best. Inspiring Team Members to Grow  Learning can take many forms. Team members have  access to on-demand training options like web-based  learning, workshops and on-site university courses. They  can also take technical and business skills training through  our internal learning management system and through  third-party systems for cultural awareness, personal and professional skills building and industry-relevant research.  In addition, a rotational program helps new hires get an in- depth understanding of their functional teams. Team members can also access the Micron-TLP Technical  Journal, an in-house, peer-reviewed archival journal with  articles published by members of the Technical Leadership  Program, as well as a variety of technical seminars. Micron’s  learning management system allows team members to  view courses that have been assigned to them or search  the catalog and self-assign items. They can also request or  register for instructor-led learning or access online learning.  As team members expand their capabilities and become  qualified for new roles, our internal job opportunities allow  them to grow within the company. Micron’s CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, joined over 400 other U.S.  companies in signing the Pledge to America’s Workers, which identifies workforce investments that will prepare  workers for tomorrow’s job market. As part of the pledge,  we have committed to providing approximately 10,000  enhanced career opportunities over the next five years  through apprenticeships, work-based learning programs,  continuing education, on-the-job training and reskilling.  We will not only increase opportunities for existing team  members, but we will also prepare students for tomorrow’s  careers by implementing new programs and partnerships  with educational institutions and creating a scholarship  program for underserved populations. Micron resources are also available to help our team  members prepare their educational plans and select  programs that further their interests and career development.  Micron offers a continuing education program, providing  tuition for eligible team members pursuing higher education 1.69M degrees, and an education assistance program for  those seeking additional industry-related courses and  certifications. In 2020, we nearly doubled the continuing  education benefit offered to all U.S. team members and  expanded the program globally. To promote Micron’s goal of enabling the workforce of  the future, we launched a new training platform, Micron  University, to promote a growth mindset among all team  members. As part of Micron University, we introduced a  digital skills platform with training on critical technology  trends, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing,  data science and digital security. Team members can select  a training opportunity by level of expertise, and leaders can  identify learning opportunities that are relevant for their team  members. A skills advisory board assesses the offerings  periodically to identify future skill needs and propose  solutions for developing them in our workforce. mindset that empowers our people to identify development  priorities, find resources to support their development and  intentionally engage in new experiences in a meaningful way. Encouraging Collaborative Learning   Our team members learn from and teach one another  through feedback, coaching and mentoring, which we view  as equally important points on the professional development  continuum. We define feedback as observations of how team  members perform at a specific point in time, coaching as an  exercise in inquiry that helps them reach their potential, and  mentoring as a sustained, organic relationship that can help  clarify possible new career paths for team members. While we do not offer centralized programs around these  types of team member interactions, we are building  awareness of their power and allowing business functions  to develop opportunities that best suit them. For example,  we recently launched a virtual coaching platform for a  small subset of leaders and developed a course on impact coaching. A training course on best practices for evaluating  performance was delivered to more than 5,000 global leaders. We offer a common mentoring playbook that is used across  all our professional development possibilities. That handbook,  accessible by all team members, is available in English,  Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Japanese and Malay. To promote collaboration across teams, Micron uses the  Emergenetics tool, which encourages team members to  actively embrace diversity of thought and behaviors. After  filling out a questionnaire, team members receive a profile  that gives them greater understanding of their actions at  work and at home. Leaders can use their team members’  results to enhance team effectiveness. Since this tool was  introduced, more than 14,400 leaders and team members  have received their customized profiles. Teams may also  participate in in-person or e-learning sessions to learn how  to apply profile insights. Micron focuses on building capabilities and accelerating  the success of leaders at key levels in the company through  a model that defines the attributes and capabilities that  all leaders need to be successful. It supports current  and emerging leaders at key transition points during  their careers while also providing learning experiences  for continued growth, including feedback, coaching and  mentoring. Resources are designed globally and delivered  locally, with the majority available in a virtual format in 2020  due to COVID-19. This model, called Micron Leadership  Accelerated, includes several key programs. Ignite  Ignite is a five-week program for individuals aspiring to move  into leadership roles. Ignite exposes these team members to  global people leadership expectations and responsibilities  prior to committing to a leadership career path. With over  300 participants a year, Micron uses the Ignite program to  build our next generation of leaders. Core Management  This program is a mandatory learning experience for new  managers either promoted within or hired into Micron. It  focuses on managerial and performance fundamentals  and covers Micron’s leadership philosophy, behaviors to  be successful and leadership styles. Participants walk  away with a solid understanding of what it takes to lead  effectively at Micron. The migration of the Core Management  experience to a virtual platform has increased both the reach  and influence of the program. Leadership Conductor  This experience supports leaders of leaders and focuses on  self-leadership, team leadership and business leadership.  Participants network and learn about enterprise thinking and  decision-making through simulated exercises customized to  their learning objectives. With 90 completions before being paused for COVID-19, we hope to relaunch this in-person  program in the latter part of FY21. Leadership Circuit  Built with busy Micron leaders in mind, the Leadership Circuit  comprises 13 short courses ranging in duration from two to  four hours. They are open enrollment and built around topics  that leaders can select to address their immediate needs.  Focus areas include communication, decision-making,  emotional intelligence, growth mindset, coaching and  storytelling. These workshops have quickly become our most  popular offerings, with almost 2,300 completions in FY20. key principles of leadership. Topics include effective one- on-one meetings, leadership of distributed teams, team  health, leadership through change, situational leadership and  conflict management. Other Resources  The resources available to leaders extend beyond our  workshops and self-guided options. A 360-degree leadership  assessment was launched in late FY20 to offer leaders a  holistic leadership skill assessment and action plan, along  with senior and executive leadership coaching. We also offer  a suite of resources, both facilitated and self-guided, that  smooth leadership transitions at all levels of the organization. “ The leadership circuit  course including the  tools and framework  provided were very  useful, comprehensive  and interactive. We can  apply what we learned in  our day-to-day activities  to help us become  better leaders and better  represent Micron values.” We transform the communities where our team members live and  work through our philanthropy and people. Our grants, programs  and volunteers focus on promoting human potential through STEM  education, basic human needs and equitable opportunities for all. For decades, Micron has given back to the communities  where our team members live and work. We’ve strengthened  this relationship among team members, our communities  and our company in recent years by aligning all philanthropic  efforts under the Micron Gives program. Ultimately, our giving programs revolve around our corporate  value of people. We provide resources and tools to elevate  how team members donate time and money to their  favorite causes. Micron Gives also inspires the next wave  of innovators and educators by developing and funding  programs to promote science, technology, engineering  and mathematics (STEM) education, with a focus on  underrepresented groups. Alongside our team members,   we also invest in our communities through charitable causes  that address basic human needs. The Micron Foundation has supported the communities  where we live, learn, work and play since 1999. In calendar year 2020, the company’s corporate programs worked  together with the foundation to address the challenges that  communities faced due to the pandemic and the systemic  racial inequalities further magnified by the pandemic.  The Micron Foundation doubled its charitable giving,  distributing nearly $24 million in grants and funds to match  team member contributions. In total, 57% of Micron team  members participated in volunteering and giving, raising $4.8  million in team member donations (matched by $8 million  from the Micron Foundation) and contributing more than  150,000 volunteer hours to their communities worldwide. Donations were delivered to charitable organizations  worldwide whose missions aligned to Micron’s charitable  priorities, with a focus on basic human needs, social  justice and education. As part of this response, the Micron  Foundation established a $10 million COVID-19 relief fund,  which is helping global efforts to promote economic recovery and provide much-needed community resources for food  banks, child care, hospitals, school meal plans and online  learning resources. Micron also distributed 367,000 masks,  10,000 gloves and 3,000 face shields to health care workers. Micron accelerated the role and influence of our team  members by matching their philanthropic donations two to  one. In total, the Micron Foundation contributed $8 million  in matching funds — quadrupling donations from 2019.  Throughout the year, more than half of all Micron team  members participated by giving either money or time, more  than doubling the engagement rate for 2019. To advance social justice, Micron, its team members and  the Micron Foundation donated more than $1 million to the  NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Throughout  2020, Micron continued to deepen our relationships with  historically Black colleges and universities and awarded  numerous grants to support student success. $23.9M+ Total Giving Micron’s citizenship efforts  have always emphasized  meeting the basic needs of  people in our communities.  In 2020, these endeavors  focused mainly on responding  to the COVID-19 crisis. In 2020, the Micron Foundation created a COVID-19 relief  fund to address many of the challenges communities faced  during this time, including increased demand for medical and  personal protective equipment, the transition of workplaces  and schools to remote settings, economic insecurity,  inadequate access to housing, and hunger. Protecting Health & Safety Health care-related grants included a donation to  Give2Asia, which partnered with leading Chinese public  health organizations to protect front-line health workers  and hospitals. Our contribution supplied food, lodging  and mental health treatment for these front-line workers.  The Micron Foundation also funded a research team at  the National University of Singapore that is developing an  artificial intelligence-based platform for treating infectious  diseases like COVID-19. Other significant grants went to  Protezione Civile in Italy, the American India Foundation, and  Boys and Girls Clubs in Idaho to provide full-day emergency  child care for essential workers. Improving Access to Education   In the pandemic’s early months, the Micron Foundation  awarded grants to organizations to promote remote learning  and distance education, including the Digital Inclusion Fund  in Idaho and a number of schools in Italy. The grants tackled  multiple problems at once — both launching online solutions  for a large number of students and creating equal access to the internet. These grants continue to help schools and  students in communities with Micron facilities where schools  are still operating remotely. Providing Economic Relief   The Micron Foundation supported the most vulnerable  members of communities through grants to organizations  such as the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund for  Idaho, the Silicon Valley Community Foundation and the  Community Foundation for Northern Virginia, which each  provide funds to trusted organizations assisting low-income  individuals affected by the crisis. Knowing that the pandemic  is disproportionately infecting and killing African Americans,  Latinos and other people of color, Micron gave $1 million in  grants to nine U.S. organizations that offer key services to  minority families, particularly those dealing with poverty or  economic loss. In addition, team members at Micron’s sites have raised  funds for other organizations in their areas. Many of these charities act as umbrella groups, sharing resources with  other nonprofits and aid groups in their regions. For example,  over 1,000 Taiwan team members raised NT$8 million  (US$267,000 at the time) for the Taiwan Fund for Children  and Families’ COVID-19 Home and School Care Project.  Their fundraising, matched two to one by Micron, helped  2,500 families and 500 children in need of emergency aid. Solving Hunger   Addressing hunger has been a major priority for  the COVID-19 relief fund. Grants have included gifts to  the Rotary Club of Muar in Malaysia, the Akshaya Patra  Foundation in India, and the Idaho Foodbank and Utah  Food Bank in the U.S. Additional funding came from our  team members. In Singapore, for example, team members  donated over 3,500 pounds of food to the Food Bank  Singapore, while others participated in the annual Walk for  Rice, taking 256 million steps that translated into meals for  7,000 families. “ With equitable opportunity  for all as our guide,  Micron Gives’ success is  measured across our three  primary pillars — creating a  culture of giving at Micron,  enriching our communities  and inspiring learning.” To be a global leader in  memory and storage  solutions, Micron relies  on its talented scientists  and engineers. Cultivating  innovators and those who  teach them aligns naturally  with how and why we   give back. As we fulfill our overall mission of transforming how the world  uses information to enrich life for all, we are increasingly  focused on developing STEM pathways that are not only  robust but also accessible to a more diverse population. In 2018, the Micron Foundation committed $1 million to  STEM programs at higher education institutions in Virginia  and introduced Virginia diversity and opportunity grants.  With a focus on women and underrepresented minorities in  science and engineering fields, we have provided 10 grants  to date, benefiting more than 50 institutions in Virginia. In  2020, we helped launch Boise State University’s Micron  Academy for Inclusive Leadership, a student-led initiative  to address social injustice, strengthen leadership skills and  build a sense of community for underrepresented students. Despite the challenges presented by COVID-19, Micron  adapted and continued many of its STEM education  initiatives, accelerating learning and growth for students  throughout the world. Our STEM grants totaled over $5  million in 2020, benefiting more than 600,000 students. While our popular Chip Camp — a summer camp for  young teens — was canceled due to the pandemic, we  quickly pivoted to offer a virtual Tech Camp. The online  format allowed us to expand our reach, with approximately 165 students from across the U.S. and Canada taking  part. Micron enrolled ethnically and economically diverse  participants in the free camp by connecting with Native  American tribes in Idaho, the refugee community in Boise,  and groups such as the National Center for Children and  Families and Techbridge Girls. Camp organizers mailed  laptops to children who didn’t have them and then met   with each virtually to be sure they were set up correctly. Micron was also one of few companies to continue its  summer internship program, providing valuable summer  internships to 205 students from over 60 institutions.  In addition, a cross-functional Micron team led a public  engineering design challenge to create a more accessible  and effective robotic solution for disinfecting rooms with  ultraviolet light, which could protect workers against  COVID-19. More than 70 designs, including many from  university teams, were submitted from around the globe.  Micron was included on the 2020 Taiwan Railways   of Popular Science tour, a STEM-themed train that   brings activities to students via a four-day railway tour   through Taiwan.  The Micron Women’s Leadership Network chapter in  Shanghai invited seventh-grade students on-site to learn  about Micron and engage in STEM activities.  Micron provided funding for hundreds of U.S. students  transitioning from elementary to secondary schools to  increase their confidence in math and computer   science classes.  Members of the Micron Young Professionals in China  assembled boxes containing educational STEM materials  for youth in their area.  Micron team members volunteered at the National Taiwan  Science Education Center.  collaborative two-day workshop with the Penang Science  Cluster in Malaysia. “ I learned to be grateful for  what I might have taken  for granted previously. My  parents have inspired me to  continue to contribute and  give back to the society,   no matter how small the  effort is.” “ It’s very inspiring to  work for Micron and its  community initiatives —  especially with all the  values that Micron stands  for, making 37,000-plus  people as one.” “ I believe that is the way  we keep our communities  strong and connected. I feel  that volunteering is one way  to support those in need as  well as provide fulfillment   in my life and in the lives   of others.” Micron team members are passionate about using their time and  skills in service of others. These people and their stories were  featured in Heart of Micron posts on Micron’s website and intranet. Throughout 2020, many individuals found ways to help their  communities stop the spread of COVID-19 and cope with the  challenges of isolation. Others, such as these dedicated team  members, supported worthy causes such as hunger relief   and education. 102-1 Name of the organization  Micron Technology, Inc. / About This Report 102-2 Activities, brands, products and services  About Micron / Micron 2020 Form 10-K (pp. 4-11) 102-3 Location of headquarters  Boise, Idaho, USA / About Micron / Micron 2020 Form 10-K (p. 14) 102-4 Location of operations  About Micron / Micron.com | Locations 102-6 Markets served  Micron 2020 Form 10-K (pp. 4-7) 102-7 Scale of the organization  About Micron / Performance at a Glance | Diversity / Micron 2020 Form 10-K (pp. 2-4, 11, 47) 102-9 Supply chain  Responsible Sourcing / Micron 2020 Form 10-K (pp. 8-9, 21-22) / Micron.com | Responsible Minerals Policy | Conflict Minerals Report / Micron.com | Sourcing Responsibly 102-10 Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain  There were no significant changes to the organization in FY20. / Micron 2020 Form 10-K (pp. 8-9, 21-22) 102-11 Precautionary principle or approach  The risk and resilience program does not use the term “precautionary principle,” but Micron does recognize it is our responsibility to prevent any harm from our actions.

This information is communicated   to all of Micron’s governance body members, full-time and part-time team members, and contractors via the company intranet and new hire onboarding. As of September 2020, 100% of governance body members and 99% of team members in all of Micron’s regions completed an annual certification to abide by the code. Micron’s  compliance and ethics team also provides live, interactive training sessions on core C&E topics, including anti-corruption. In 2020, more than 1,000 team members attended these live  training sessions worldwide.  Micron and its subsidiaries expect suppliers to adopt and implement the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and Micron codes of conduct regardless of local business practices or  social customs. Micron’s supplier requirements standard communicates code of conduct expectations annually through the training and business reviews. In FY20, all new Micron  suppliers received communication on this topic during the onboarding process, which every supplier must agree to as a condition of doing business. All reports made in good faith are investigated thoroughly and appropriate action is taken in cases that are substantiated. In FY20, all new Micron suppliers received communication on anti-corruption and compliance with the Micron and RBA codes of conduct during the onboarding process via training on  supplier responsibility expectations. Of these, 13% required further screening and only 1% were terminated (not onboarded) based on failures to commit to policy improvements. No  confirmed incidents of corruption were recorded among team members.

Performance at a Glance | Health & Safety Micron’s global business model provides opportunities for team members to complete assignments in different countries. In 2020, 5% of the workforce were foreign  nationals, and 73% were located outside the U.S. Micron protects workers per the Micron Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our code guides how to act with integrity and make the right choices. It summarizes  the laws and ethical principles that apply to our work, including industry standards like the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) code of conduct. We are strongly  committed to respecting and protecting human rights wherever we operate. To that end, we follow all applicable laws relating to working hours and wages. Micron  does not retain team members’ identity or immigration original documents, such as government-issued identification, passports or work permits, unless such  holdings are required by law. To protect human rights beyond our direct operations, Micron further requires our suppliers and contractors to adopt the same or  similar standards. In addition to the defined SASB metrics, Micron recognizes the importance of managing workforce recruitment, education, training, engagement, and turnover as  elements of recruiting and managing a global and skilled workforce (elements also mentioned in the SASB semiconductor standard), as well as diversity, equality  and inclusion in the workforce, and we report extensively on these in our sustainability report and elsewhere.

While this specific standard disclosure is not a relevant metric for Micron given the breadth of the company’s product portfolio and manufacture of memory and  storage (rather than processors), Micron recognizes the importance of product energy efficiency. Our approach to this topic and data about the efficiency of some  recent products can be found in Products & Innovation | Product Efficiency and Micron 2020 Form 10-K (pp. 4-8).

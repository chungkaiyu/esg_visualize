Corporate Governance As for corporate governance, we seek to build a highly  effective framework that achieves sustainable growth  while taking into consideration our corporate culture and  business characteristics for the proper functioning of  management’s decision-making and supervisory role. We  have introduced a skills matrix in this fiscal year and will  encourage diversity in the members of our Board of  Directors and promote further improvement to  deliberations. In addition, to further strengthen  compliance and risk management, we have defined 13  business-related and other risks across our value chain  and are working to strengthen our framework to be  capable of always going through the PDCA* cycle. We will build governance that is both proactive and  prudent to incorporate our growth potential to the  maximum extent. Reflecting on the past, the 1990s were called  computer-centric, with personal computers driving the  semiconductor market. We then entered the  mobile-centric 2000s, when smartphones drove the  market. Going forward, we will enter the age of DX,  where billions of “things” will be connected to the  internet and the big data generated by these things will  drive society. Global data traffic is expected to increase at  a compounded annual growth rate of 26%1. The semiconductor market will expand greatly to  support the explosive increase in data traffic. In the  nearly 70 years since the invention of the transistor in  1947, the size of the global semiconductor market  reached approximately US$440 billion in 2020. It is  expected to reach US$1 trillion in 2030, more than twice  the size of the current market which has grown over the  past 70 years. In other words, it means a market that is  the same size or greater than the current one will  develop in the next 10 years. (Fig. C) The wafer fab equipment (WFE2) market that we are a  part of is expected to have a market size of over US$90  billion in 20213. Looking toward the future, further growth  is expected with the trends toward ICT, DX, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all  stakeholders for your continued support and patronage. Tokyo Electron was established in 1963 by a few  young people full of venture spirit. That spirit has been  passed down through the years, making it possible for us  to launch innovative equipment for semiconductor and  LCD panel manufacturing, areas characterized by rapid  technological change.  With the spread of IoT, AI and 5G today, the shift  toward a data-driven society is accelerating, and we Based on these aforementioned ideas, we will adopt  strategies that maximize the application of our expertise and  strengths, which are as follows: (1) being the only  manufacturer in the world with the series of four key process  systems required for semiconductor scaling; (2) having the  number one or two product share for these systems; (3)  specifically, our 100% share of coater/developers for EUV  lithography, which is essential for leading-edge scaling; and  (4) delivering approximately 4,000 units annually and having  a cumulative number of equipment installations of  approximately 76,000 units, the largest number in the  industry, through which sold equipment become new  business opportunities and build a business model for field  solutions that generate value. (Fig. G) Under such circumstances, we plan to invest 165  billion yen for research and development in fiscal 2022,  the highest amount ever. When we revised the  aforementioned Medium-term Management Plan, we  announced a research and development investment plan  of approximately 400 billion yen in the three years  starting from fiscal 2020. We are executing investments  according to this plan. Going forward, we will continue to  proactively invest in growth using our solid financial  foundation based on profits. Virtually every semiconductor or display in the world  passes through our systems. We will further grow our  strengths and bring in growth opportunities to the  furthest extent possible. A rich future that will be realized by semiconductors, and  semiconductors which continue to evolve; the market for  production equipment which support these has entered  a further growth phase.  Corporate growth is about people, and employees  both create and fulfill company values. Utilizing our  expertise as an equipment manufacturer and diverse  management resources, we will provide society with  high-value-added technologies that the world has never  seen and only we can accomplish. Going forward, we will continue to take on challenges  and evolve to be a truly excellent global company that is  loved and highly trusted by all stakeholders. We look forward to your continued support and patronage. decarbonization, electric vehicles, autonomous driving  and post-5G communication, and just as the  semiconductor market is expected to reach US$1 trillion,  the WFE market will also enter what we refer to as a new  “Big Years” growth phase. (Fig. D)  To achieve further growth, we will ride the wave of  such technological innovation and create high-added- value technologies that the world has never seen and  only we can accomplish. Applying our expertise as an  equipment manufacturer developed through being an  industry leader and using all management resources,  including our employees who both create and fulfill  company values, we will contribute toward achieving the  societal shared value of balancing “Digital × Green”. We  will strive to practice our Corporate Philosophy and  achieve sustainable growth through these efforts and  meet the expectations of all stakeholders. Our sustainability initiatives are the practice of our  Corporate Philosophy itself. We will achieve sustainable  growth and the enhancement of corporate value by  using our unique expertise as an equipment  manufacturer and contributing to the development of  industry and society. The Environment Based on this approach, we are undertaking the building  of a carbon-free society from three perspectives.  First, we will contribute toward higher performance  and lower power consumption for semiconductor  devices being used around the world. We will create the  societal shared value of balancing “Digital × Green” by  promoting technological innovation together with our  customers. Next is saving energy during the operation of  equipment. In December of last year, we revised our  Medium-term Environmental Goals for 2030,  announcing our goal of reducing per-wafer CO2  emissions by 30% compared to 2018. The third perspective is the activities at our plants and  offices. We have set our goals to achieve a rate of 100%  renewable energy usage and a 70% reduction in total CO2  emissions compared to 2018 by 2030. (Fig. H) We will fulfill our mission and responsibility toward  achieving decarbonization based on industry-leading,  top-class goals. expect to see further expansion in business  opportunities against a backdrop that demands  unending technological innovation. Amid such circumstances, we constantly remain  aware of the “Purpose” of our existence in society, as  represented by our Corporate Philosophy: “We strive to  contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring  society through our leading-edge technologies and  reliable service and support”. By leading the world in the  creation of high-value-added technologies, we strive to  expand profits in the medium to long term, and  continuously enhance our corporate value. B: Technological Demands on Semiconductors and Displays  Fig. A: Trend toward the Future In May 2019, we revised our Medium-term Management  Plan upward. We developed a financial model that shows  the relationship between operating margin and return on  equity (ROE) that we should seek to achieve for each  anticipated sales scope. The model’s core targets are to  achieve net sales of 2 trillion yen, an operating margin of  30% or more and an ROE of 30% or more by fiscal 2024.  It was designed to capture as much growth potential as  possible while steadily reinforcing our financial strength  and seeking to achieve world-class profits and ROE.  (Fig. E) Through these profits, we will achieve shareholder  satisfaction and stable and enriching lives for our  employees in all business situations. We will also strive to  invest in technology development and secure  outstanding human resources for continuous growth. In  addition, we will seek financing when necessary under  favorable conditions by building a solid financial  foundation based on profits and fulfill our corporate  responsibility by paying proper taxes. For fiscal 2022, we forecast net sales to be 1,850 billion  yen with a 27.5% operating margin*. We assess that we  are making smooth progress toward our targets and will  continue to work as one to achieve this financial model. * Net sales and operating margin for fiscal 2022 are estimates as of August 16, 2021. The previous year 2020 saw the global spread of  COVID-19 and frequent natural disasters arising from  climate change, including torrential rains in Japan and  hurricanes and cold spells in North America. In addition,  there were geopolitical issues such as trade friction as  well as various human rights issues that occurred  worldwide. It became a year carved in history as one that  had a major impact on society and the lives of people. On the other hand, it was also a year when digital  transformation (DX) made progress in our daily lives and  all kinds of industries, and the importance of  semiconductors, which are essential for information and  communication technologies (ICT), became prominent. As the shift toward a data-driven society accelerates  and efforts to solve global environmental problems  progress, “Digital × Green” has become a major trend  worldwide. Green refers to carbon neutrality, the goal of  decarbonization by suppressing CO2 emissions. (Fig. Human Resources We believe corporate growth is about people, and  employees both create and fulfill company values. Based  on this approach, we place importance on the following  three perspectives. The first perspective is from the corporate culture and  codes of conduct that we have cherished since our  founding, and we summarized them as TEL Values1. We  always keep in mind the TEL Values as we strive to create  a company replete with dreams and vitality. The second perspective is from management that  emphasizes motivation. “Employee capabilities and  motivation” is essential for the Company’s growth, and  we focus on improving employee motivation together  with the strengthening of human resource development  such as through TEL UNIVERSITY2. We see the main  components of employee motivation as (1) dreams and  expectations of the Company’s future; (2) opportunities  to take on challenges; (3) fair evaluations that recognize  employee effort; and (4) an open workplace. Based on  these components, we introduced a new human  resources system in July of 2017 to promote the  improvement of communication between managers and We established E-COMPASS (Environmental  Co-Creation by Material, Process and Subcomponent  Solutions) in June of this year as a new supply chain  sustainability initiative. We will actively endeavor to  preserve the global environment throughout the  supply chain. (Fig. We define our material issues as we strive for medium- to  long-term profit expansion and continuous enhancement  of corporate value. In addition to “Management  Foundation”, with areas such as safety, quality,  compliance, governance and risk management that  support our business activities at the foundational level,  our material issues consist of “Product Competitiveness”,  “Customer Responsiveness” and “Higher Productivity”. As  a manufacturer, we always keep in mind the pursuit of  becoming “Only One, Number One” through sales and  support of equipment with world-leading performance  that fulfills extreme technological needs; that is to say,  we offer the Best Products and Best Technical Service. We  will quickly grasp the changes in the trends of and needs  for leading-edge technologies to create next-generation  products with overwhelming added value and  performance required by customers in the future; be the  sole strategic partner using our customer responsiveness;  and further strengthen our earning power using higher  productivity based on continually improving operational  efficiency. (Fig. Therefore, the world is currently pushing firmly ahead  with implementing ICT and DX as well as taking action to  realize a carbon-free society in order to build a strong  and resilient society in which economic activities do not  stop under any circumstances. Going forward, the digitalization of all kinds of  industries will penetrate widely through society,  including the evolution of new technologies such as  autonomous driving and smart fabs, smart agriculture,  smart medical care, and smart cities. Standing at their  core and supporting them are semiconductors.  Semiconductors were first used in computers and  television sets and then spread to mobile phones. They  are now no longer simply chips that power things but  have instead become an infrastructure for the whole of  society. It is only with semiconductors that the  digitalization of society becomes possible. The  technological demands on semiconductors, such as  larger capacity, higher speed, higher reliability, and lower  power consumption, are limitless. Alongside the evolution of semiconductors are displays  that form the interface between people and data.  Technological innovation continues to center on organic  light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and application is expanding  beyond the concept of just being monitors. Technological  innovation will continue as long as efforts to make  displays more beautiful and easier to use continue. (Fig. their subordinates. In addition, the Corporate Senior Staff  (CSS), consisting of our executive officers and  management executives of overseas subsidiaries, reviews  the progress of the entire Group’s overall growth strategy  and additional measures every quarter to improve  openness and mobility within our organization. I also  personally communicate the Company’s direction at  employee meetings being held at each location and listen  to on-site opinions and proposals from employees  directly in an effort to make prompt and accurate  management decisions. The third perspective is from human resource  diversity. With 76 locations in 18 countries and regions  around the world, 42% of our employees are foreign  nationals. We actively implement initiatives for global  diversity, including appointing the presidents and  management executives of overseas subsidiaries mainly  from locally recruited employees. In addition, we are also  undertaking further gender-related initiatives to promote  diversity and inclusion to bring about further growth. 7 8 TOKYO ELECTRON Integrated Report 2021 TOKYO ELECTRON Integrated Report 2021 Fig. C: Outlook for the Semiconductor Market Fig. D: WFE Market Trends Fig. E: Financial Model of Medium-term Management Plan Fig. F: Our Material Issues Corporate Governance As for corporate governance, we seek to build a highly  effective framework that achieves sustainable growth  while taking into consideration our corporate culture and  business characteristics for the proper functioning of  management’s decision-making and supervisory role.

(Fig. G) Under such circumstances, we plan to invest 165  billion yen for research and development in fiscal 2022,  the highest amount ever. When we revised the  aforementioned Medium-term Management Plan, we  announced a research and development investment plan  of approximately 400 billion yen in the three years  starting from fiscal 2020. We are executing investments  according to this plan. Going forward, we will continue to  proactively invest in growth using our solid financial  foundation based on profits. Virtually every semiconductor or display in the world  passes through our systems. We will further grow our  strengths and bring in growth opportunities to the  furthest extent possible. G: Systems for Series of Four Key Processes Fig. I:  E-COMPASS  Fig. H: Medium-term Environmental Goals A rich future that will be realized by semiconductors, and  semiconductors which continue to evolve; the market for  production equipment which support these has entered  a further growth phase.  Corporate growth is about people, and employees  both create and fulfill company values. Utilizing our  expertise as an equipment manufacturer and diverse  management resources, we will provide society with  high-value-added technologies that the world has never  seen and only we can accomplish. Going forward, we will continue to take on challenges  and evolve to be a truly excellent global company that is  loved and highly trusted by all stakeholders. We look forward to your continued support and patronage. decarbonization, electric vehicles, autonomous driving  and post-5G communication, and just as the  semiconductor market is expected to reach US$1 trillion,  the WFE market will also enter what we refer to as a new  “Big Years” growth phase. (Fig. D)  To achieve further growth, we will ride the wave of  such technological innovation and create high-added- value technologies that the world has never seen and  only we can accomplish. Applying our expertise as an  equipment manufacturer developed through being an  industry leader and using all management resources,  including our employees who both create and fulfill  company values, we will contribute toward achieving the  societal shared value of balancing “Digital × Green”. We  will strive to practice our Corporate Philosophy and  achieve sustainable growth through these efforts and  meet the expectations of all stakeholders. Our sustainability initiatives are the practice of our  Corporate Philosophy itself. We will achieve sustainable  growth and the enhancement of corporate value by  using our unique expertise as an equipment  manufacturer and contributing to the development of  industry and society. The Environment Based on this approach, we are undertaking the building  of a carbon-free society from three perspectives.  First, we will contribute toward higher performance  and lower power consumption for semiconductor  devices being used around the world. We will create the  societal shared value of balancing “Digital × Green” by  promoting technological innovation together with our  customers. Next is saving energy during the operation of  equipment. In December of last year, we revised our  Medium-term Environmental Goals for 2030,  announcing our goal of reducing per-wafer CO2  emissions by 30% compared to 2018. The third perspective is the activities at our plants and  offices. We have set our goals to achieve a rate of 100%  renewable energy usage and a 70% reduction in total CO2  emissions compared to 2018 by 2030. (Fig. H) We will fulfill our mission and responsibility toward  achieving decarbonization based on industry-leading,  top-class goals. expect to see further expansion in business  opportunities against a backdrop that demands  unending technological innovation. Amid such circumstances, we constantly remain  aware of the “Purpose” of our existence in society, as  represented by our Corporate Philosophy: “We strive to  contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring  society through our leading-edge technologies and  reliable service and support”. By leading the world in the  creation of high-value-added technologies, we strive to  expand profits in the medium to long term, and  continuously enhance our corporate value. In May 2019, we revised our Medium-term Management  Plan upward. We developed a financial model that shows  the relationship between operating margin and return on  equity (ROE) that we should seek to achieve for each  anticipated sales scope. The model’s core targets are to  achieve net sales of 2 trillion yen, an operating margin of  30% or more and an ROE of 30% or more by fiscal 2024.  It was designed to capture as much growth potential as  possible while steadily reinforcing our financial strength  and seeking to achieve world-class profits and ROE.  (Fig. E) Through these profits, we will achieve shareholder  satisfaction and stable and enriching lives for our  employees in all business situations. We will also strive to  invest in technology development and secure  outstanding human resources for continuous growth. In  addition, we will seek financing when necessary under  favorable conditions by building a solid financial  foundation based on profits and fulfill our corporate  responsibility by paying proper taxes. For fiscal 2022, we forecast net sales to be 1,850 billion  yen with a 27.5% operating margin*. We assess that we  are making smooth progress toward our targets and will  continue to work as one to achieve this financial model. * Net sales and operating margin for fiscal 2022 are estimates as of August 16, 2021. The previous year 2020 saw the global spread of  COVID-19 and frequent natural disasters arising from  climate change, including torrential rains in Japan and  hurricanes and cold spells in North America. In addition,  there were geopolitical issues such as trade friction as  well as various human rights issues that occurred  worldwide. It became a year carved in history as one that  had a major impact on society and the lives of people. On the other hand, it was also a year when digital  transformation (DX) made progress in our daily lives and  all kinds of industries, and the importance of  semiconductors, which are essential for information and  communication technologies (ICT), became prominent. As the shift toward a data-driven society accelerates  and efforts to solve global environmental problems  progress, “Digital × Green” has become a major trend  worldwide. Green refers to carbon neutrality, the goal of  decarbonization by suppressing CO2 emissions. (Fig. Human Resources We believe corporate growth is about people, and  employees both create and fulfill company values. Based  on this approach, we place importance on the following  three perspectives. The first perspective is from the corporate culture and  codes of conduct that we have cherished since our  founding, and we summarized them as TEL Values1. We  always keep in mind the TEL Values as we strive to create  a company replete with dreams and vitality. The second perspective is from management that  emphasizes motivation. “Employee capabilities and  motivation” is essential for the Company’s growth, and  we focus on improving employee motivation together  with the strengthening of human resource development  such as through TEL UNIVERSITY2. We see the main  components of employee motivation as (1) dreams and  expectations of the Company’s future; (2) opportunities  to take on challenges; (3) fair evaluations that recognize  employee effort; and (4) an open workplace. Based on  these components, we introduced a new human  resources system in July of 2017 to promote the  improvement of communication between managers and We established E-COMPASS (Environmental  Co-Creation by Material, Process and Subcomponent  Solutions) in June of this year as a new supply chain  sustainability initiative. We will actively endeavor to  preserve the global environment throughout the  supply chain. (Fig. We define our material issues as we strive for medium- to  long-term profit expansion and continuous enhancement  of corporate value. In addition to “Management  Foundation”, with areas such as safety, quality,  compliance, governance and risk management that  support our business activities at the foundational level,  our material issues consist of “Product Competitiveness”,  “Customer Responsiveness” and “Higher Productivity”. As  a manufacturer, we always keep in mind the pursuit of  becoming “Only One, Number One” through sales and  support of equipment with world-leading performance  that fulfills extreme technological needs; that is to say,  we offer the Best Products and Best Technical Service. We  will quickly grasp the changes in the trends of and needs  for leading-edge technologies to create next-generation  products with overwhelming added value and  performance required by customers in the future; be the  sole strategic partner using our customer responsiveness;  and further strengthen our earning power using higher  productivity based on continually improving operational  efficiency. (Fig. Therefore, the world is currently pushing firmly ahead  with implementing ICT and DX as well as taking action to  realize a carbon-free society in order to build a strong  and resilient society in which economic activities do not  stop under any circumstances. Going forward, the digitalization of all kinds of  industries will penetrate widely through society,  including the evolution of new technologies such as  autonomous driving and smart fabs, smart agriculture,  smart medical care, and smart cities. Standing at their  core and supporting them are semiconductors.  Semiconductors were first used in computers and  television sets and then spread to mobile phones. They  are now no longer simply chips that power things but  have instead become an infrastructure for the whole of  society. It is only with semiconductors that the  digitalization of society becomes possible. The  technological demands on semiconductors, such as  larger capacity, higher speed, higher reliability, and lower  power consumption, are limitless. Alongside the evolution of semiconductors are displays  that form the interface between people and data.  Technological innovation continues to center on organic  light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and application is expanding  beyond the concept of just being monitors. Technological  innovation will continue as long as efforts to make  displays more beautiful and easier to use continue. (Fig. their subordinates. In addition, the Corporate Senior Staff  (CSS), consisting of our executive officers and  management executives of overseas subsidiaries, reviews  the progress of the entire Group’s overall growth strategy  and additional measures every quarter to improve  openness and mobility within our organization. I also  personally communicate the Company’s direction at  employee meetings being held at each location and listen  to on-site opinions and proposals from employees  directly in an effort to make prompt and accurate  management decisions. The third perspective is from human resource  diversity. With 76 locations in 18 countries and regions  around the world, 42% of our employees are foreign  nationals. We actively implement initiatives for global  diversity, including appointing the presidents and  management executives of overseas subsidiaries mainly  from locally recruited employees. In addition, we are also  undertaking further gender-related initiatives to promote  diversity and inclusion to bring about further growth. 1 Refer to TEL Values on p. 12 Corporate Governance As for corporate governance, we seek to build a highly  effective framework that achieves sustainable growth  while taking into consideration our corporate culture and  business characteristics for the proper functioning of  management’s decision-making and supervisory role. We  have introduced a skills matrix in this fiscal year and will  encourage diversity in the members of our Board of  Directors and promote further improvement to  deliberations. In addition, to further strengthen  compliance and risk management, we have defined 13  business-related and other risks across our value chain  and are working to strengthen our framework to be  capable of always going through the PDCA* cycle. We will build governance that is both proactive and  prudent to incorporate our growth potential to the  maximum extent. Reflecting on the past, the 1990s were called  computer-centric, with personal computers driving the  semiconductor market. We then entered the  mobile-centric 2000s, when smartphones drove the  market. Going forward, we will enter the age of DX,  where billions of “things” will be connected to the  internet and the big data generated by these things will  drive society. Global data traffic is expected to increase at  a compounded annual growth rate of 26%1. The semiconductor market will expand greatly to  support the explosive increase in data traffic. In the  nearly 70 years since the invention of the transistor in  1947, the size of the global semiconductor market  reached approximately US$440 billion in 2020. It is  expected to reach US$1 trillion in 2030, more than twice  the size of the current market which has grown over the  past 70 years. In other words, it means a market that is  the same size or greater than the current one will  develop in the next 10 years. (Fig. C) The wafer fab equipment (WFE2) market that we are a  part of is expected to have a market size of over US$90  billion in 20213. Looking toward the future, further growth  is expected with the trends toward ICT, DX, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all  stakeholders for your continued support and patronage.

Pursuit of Technological Innovations As the spread of IoT, AI and 5G accelerates the transition to a  data-driven society, the role played by semiconductors is  becoming ever more important. The big data era will require  large quantities of diverse semiconductors as well as even higher  performance. There is no stopping technological innovation in  semiconductors, including larger capacity, higher speed,  improved reliability and lower power consumption. Meanwhile,  the application scope for displays, which form the interface  between people and data, is expected to expand thanks to  higher resolution, lower power consumption, larger size and  improved design freedom from taking advantage of flexible  shapes. As long as technological innovations continue, the  semiconductor and flat panel display (FPD) markets will keep  growing. At the same time, the market for production  equipment, which supports these devices, can also be expected  to grow further. Requirements of Production Equipment Manufacturers Along with evolutions in semiconductors and FPDs, new  materials and more complex structures are being adopted,  resulting in an increasing degree of technical challenges in their  production. As many as dozens of billions of transistors are  integrated into leading-edge semiconductor chips, which are  produced through more than 1,000 processing steps fully  utilizing nanofabrication technologies. Consequently, the  technical requirements for semiconductor and FPD production  equipment are becoming more and more advanced. For production equipment manufacturers, it is extremely important to develop highest-performance equipment that  helps realize semiconductor and FPD technological innovations  by fully utilizing specialized expertise in a variety of fields,  including electronics, mechanics, process and software.  Therefore, it is crucial that manufacturers comprehend customer  needs early, based on a solid relationship of mutual trust with  customers, and carry out research and development  continuously not only in-house but also with customers and  consortiums. In addition, to carry out research and development  that span multiple generations with an eye toward the future,  solid management and financial foundations are also essential.  Furthermore, the importance of technical services that support  stable equipment operation is continuing to increase, and the  utilization of AI and other technologies is actively being  promoted toward providing higher-value-added services. In our business activities, it is also crucial to build a  sustainable supply chain based on partnerships with a variety of  suppliers, including those who supply parts and materials,  assemble and adjust equipment, and perform customs  clearance and logistics operations. Moreover, as a “Digital × Green” society is being promoted, the  demand for reducing environmental impact is also heightening.  Toward the realization of a sustainable society, production  equipment manufacturers are required to contribute to the  preservation of the global environment through various steps,  such as contributing to the development of low-power- consumption semiconductors and FPDs, increasing the  productivity of their production equipment and improving the  operational efficiency of their plants and offices. 17 18 TOKYO ELECTRON Integrated Report 2021 TOKYO ELECTRON Integrated Report 2021 For information about the material issues’ identification process and the annual goals, please refer to the Tokyo Electron Sustainability Report 2021.  www.tel.com/csr/report As a manufacturer of semiconductor and flat panel display  production equipment, we have identified “Product  Competitiveness”, “Customer Responsiveness” and “Higher  Productivity” as three items to be enhanced in the Medium-term  Management Plan.

The  progress of our activities and legal compliance status are  checked through internal audits and third-party audits. Any  issues identified through these activities are reviewed by the  Environment Council, reported to the Manufacturing Company  Presidents’ Council and used for promoting environmental  activities across the entire Group. Under such an environment  management system, fiscal 2021 was again free from  environmental incidents, accidents, violations and associated  legal proceedings. dropping our CO₂ emissions by 40%. In terms of products, we are  moving ahead with understanding the amount of CO₂ emissions  during use of standard equipment and creating a roadmap. We are  rolling out activities toward achieving our goals based on this. We have set the following as a long-term goal to achieve by  2050: “As a leading company in environmental management, we  strive to contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring  society by proactively promoting the reduction of environmental  burden of both our products, plants and offices, and at the same  time, providing evolutionary manufacturing technologies that  effectively reduce the power consumption of electronic products”.  We are working on initiatives for this at a company-wide level. E-COMPASS We established E-COMPASS (Environmental Co-Creation by  Material, Process and Subcomponent Solutions) as a new supply  chain sustainability initiative. E-COMPASS aims to align our  products and the entire operations more closely with our  environmental mandates, strengthen our ties with business Initiatives Related to Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) We are pursuing ongoing disclosures and initiatives based on the  TCFD framework and relating to risks and opportunities that  climate change presents to our business. Status of Initiatives Related to Recommendations of the TCFD • Governance Each of our corporate directors for EHS and CSR is working under  the supervision of the CEO to monitor progress of goals related  to our response to climate change. With the establishment of the  EHS Promotion Department and CSR Operations Department at  headquarters, these activities are being driven by the entire  Group. At the Environmental Council , comprised of members  appointed by executives of the Group companies, company- wide goals are set, progress is monitored and the achievement of  these goals is promoted. • Strategy Utilizing the framework of the TCFD recommendations, we  identified the risks and opportunities of climate change that will  impact business over the medium to long term. We have  evaluated the quantitative impact on business from some of  those risks and opportunities, and we aim to continue  quantifying others going forward as we investigate relevant  measures. • Risk Management Through the Manufacturing Company Presidents’ Council, we  approve company-wide risk management initiatives, from short  term to long term, that related divisions and councils  recommend, and then apply those initiatives to the facilities and • Increased energy costs in line with taxes on fuel and energy. Assuming our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and use  of renewable energy remain at fiscal 2021 levels, if a carbon tax were applied, we estimate our costs would increase  by 1.1 billion yen/year by fiscal 2026 (assuming a tax of 6,000 yen per ton CO2) and 2.6 billion yen/year by fiscal 2041  (14,000 yen per ton CO2)  • Decreased net sales if we are unable to meet customers’ requirements and demands for environmental initiatives • Reduced reputation among investors, NGOs and local communities if a response to climate change and other  environmental issues is delayed divisions of the Group companies. For Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions, we are adopting renewable  energy from a global perspective, including the implementation  of measures at our key manufacturing sites in Japan with high  emissions.  For Scope 3 emissions, we recognize the importance of  providing products that generate fewer CO2 emissions because  about 88% of the emissions in our entire value chain are  generated during use of products after sale, so we are focusing  on development of a range of environmental technologies. We also formulate business continuity plans in anticipation of  natural disasters caused by abnormal weather and other factors,  and take measures with our suppliers to ensure that business  operations can be maintained. • Metrics and Targets To further reinforce our initiatives toward improving  environmental performance of products and conserving the  environment at our plants and offices, we revised our medium- term environmental goals in December 2020*. While supporting  the advancement of information and communications  technology through the provision of our semiconductor and FPD  production equipment, we are also committed to achieving new  environmental goals in keeping with our Corporate Philosophy:  "We strive to contribute to the development of a dream- inspiring society through our leading-edge technologies and  reliable service and support.” * Refer to Medium- and Long-term Environmental Goals on p. 35 partners, solidify our industry leadership, and pave the way for a  sustainable future. We will utilize every management resource at  our disposal to drive the major trends of digitalization and  greening of society and actively endeavor to preserve the global  environment throughout the supply chain. 2 SEMI S2: This is a set of environmental, health and safety guidelines for  semiconductor production equipment. It is used mainly by the leading manufacturers  of semiconductor equipment in the United States and Europe, not only for  semiconductors but also as safe procurement guidelines for electric and electronic  device manufacturing equipment around the world. Safe Design of Equipment Taking the entire product life cycle into consideration, we carry  out product risk assessments as early as possible in the  development phase. Based on the assessment results, we  implement safe equipment design1 to reduce the risks posed to  humans. We also examine and ensure compliance with  increasingly strict laws and regulations around the globe, and  have a system in place for all safety regulations of the regions  where our equipment is delivered. Equipment we ship is checked  to ensure that it complies with international safety standards such  as SEMI S22 and CE marking3 as well as the safety laws and  regulations of each country and region. Safety utilized a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) for internal use,  based on the RBA Code of Conduct, and also reviewed the results  of a CSR assessment3 for suppliers of materials, staffing and  logistics to assess the current situation throughout the value  chain. We are using the results of these surveys to consider  corrective actions and reduce human rights risks. Approach to Safety Under the “Safety First” slogan, everyone at Tokyo Electron, from  top management to on-site personnel, is actively and  continuously improving safety and promoting health, giving  safety and health the highest priority when carrying out various  types of operations such as development, manufacturing,  transportation, installation and maintenance. Approach to Human Rights Conscious of our corporate social responsibility, we recognize  that it is important to conduct ourselves with a strong sense of  integrity. Based on this recognition, we have firmly upheld  human rights since our founding, as reflected in the spirit of our  Corporate Philosophy and Management Policies. For us,  respecting human rights means a significant undertaking, not  only to fulfill our responsibility for eliminating adverse impacts  on people caused through business activities, but also to respect  those people who support our business activities, and contribute  to the realization of a sustainable, dream-inspiring society. We  incorporate the concept of respect into every aspect of our  business activities, and strive to nurture a dynamic corporate  culture where each person can realize his or her full potential. 2 RBA Code of Conduct: A global initiative with a focus on the electronics industry, the  Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) establishes a set of standards for supply chains in  the electronics industry for a safe labor environment, to ensure that workers are treated  with respect and dignity, and that companies take responsibility for environmental  impact in the manufacturing process. 1  Human Rights Policy: www.tel.com/csr/employee/diversity/ Human Rights Initiatives In fiscal 2018, we formulated our Human Rights Policy1,  summarizing our approach to human rights. We have specified the  human rights we believe are particularly important in business  activities as Freedom, Equality & Non-Discrimination; Freely  Chosen Employment; Product Safety & Workplace Health and  Safety; Freedom of Association; and Appropriate Working Hours &  Breaks/Holidays/Vacations. In preparing the Human Rights Policy,  we referred to the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business  and Human Rights and the International Bill of Human Rights and  the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work  referred to therein, the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global  Compact, and the RBA Code of Conduct2. Handling of Accidents We analyze the causes of all accidents and implement corrective  measures. We strive to prevent accident recurrence by not only  identifying the main cause, but also carrying out multi-faceted  cause analysis, targeting the operator who was involved, the facility,  the environment, the involved coworkers and the management  aspect, and sharing the results with all Group companies. Safety Education We are implementing two education programs globally for the  establishment of safe work environments. The first is a program  on basic safety targeting all employees and the second is a  program on advanced safety targeting employees working on  manufacturing lines and cleanrooms. To eliminate incidents, we  also provide online training and risk assessment training for  employees in Japan and overseas. Also, to expand the concept of  safe equipment design to our design, manufacture and service  operations, we hold a semiannual safe equipment design  seminar at our manufacturing sites in Japan, inviting an external  guest to speak. Finally, we also promote our initiatives to prevent  accidents, such as providing our suppliers and customers with  safety information as circumstances demand. As a result of  having maintained a high priority on creating safe work  environments, TCIR has been maintained at less than the  Company’s target of 0.5, with 0.27 in fiscal 2021. TCIR 0.27 We ensure that our executives and employees, as well as  suppliers, are fully aware of this content. Specifically, we publish  the Human Rights Policy on our website to make it available to  everyone inside and outside the Company, and also implement  online human rights training targeting all of our executives and  employees. In fiscal 2021, as in the previous fiscal year, we  conducted human rights due diligence, as well as risk surveys,  and identified and assessed impacts. As part of the surveys, we We recognize the importance of having highly effective  grievance mechanisms related to human rights and are working  to establish and operate those mechanisms. In fiscal 2021, we  further strengthened our internal and external reporting systems  in Japan and overseas for employees and suppliers. By continuing The results of human rights risk surveys conducted at  suppliers showed that 35% of those with 500 or more  employees had potential/actual risks. Among these risks, the  major risks are health and safety issues related to human  rights, followed by labor issues. Based on these results, we  continued to request those suppliers to comply with  domestic laws and regulations and social norms related to health and safety. We will work to reduce human rights risks  by promoting corrective actions together with our suppliers. Meanwhile, inside our company, we identified potential  human rights risks in the areas of labor, and health and safety.  To mitigate these risks, we are renewing our efforts to fully  manage working hours and also taking steps to improve  operational efficiency further. 3 Refer to Supply Chain Management on p. 39 to conduct human rights due diligence going forward, we will  assess and correct any human rights issues we identify in our  business activities, and further improve the grievance  mechanisms we provide. Actions to reduce risks based on  assessment results • Feedback sheet publication •   Program development and  review according to issues Initiatives in the Supply Chain CSR Operations To keep track of our suppliers’ engagement in CSR activities,  we have conducted a CSR assessment in the areas such as  labor, health and safety, the environment and ethics since  fiscal 2014. We analyze the results of the assessments, provide  feedback and work together with our suppliers to remediate  any issues. In fiscal 2019, we completely revised the content of  the survey based on audit standards stipulated by the RBA,  and have since conducted surveys on materials1, staffing2 and  logistics3 suppliers. In fiscal 2021, with the help and understanding of our  suppliers, steps were taken to repay workers with respect to  cases of an employment-related expense burden for forced  labor and bonded labor, which had been identified in the  previous fiscal year and which have been given particular Principles and System of Supply Chain Management The building and maintenance of a supply chain, which responds  flexibly to the demands and risks of a diverse society and  contributes to the creation of new value, is crucial for the  enhancement of our medium- and long-term corporate value.  To make our entire supply chain sound and sustainable, we have  formulated a procurement policy based on the laws, regulations  and social norms of each country, as well as the RBA Code of  Conduct, and are promoting activities based on this policy by  disseminating it throughout the Company and our suppliers. We  also promote improvement activities from various perspectives  while valuing continuous communication with diverse suppliers,  including materials suppliers that handle parts and raw materials,  staffing suppliers that provide services and logistics suppliers  that handle physical distribution operations. We strive to create value in the supply chain by working to  build relationships of trust with our suppliers, who support our  business as partners, and by working together to conduct  operations in compliance with global standards. Under the  leadership of the Representative Director, President & CEO,  issues identified during various activities are shared with relevant  divisions for consideration and action on specific improvements. Responsible Procurement of Minerals (Conflict Minerals) We regard taking action against conflict minerals (3TG4) obtained  through illegal exploitation, including sources with human rights  violations or poor working conditions, as an important part of  corporate social responsibility. Our resolute goal is to eliminate the  use of raw materials made from these conflict minerals, as well as  any parts or components containing them. We conduct surveys on  conflict materials using the CMRT5 and referring to the OECD6 Due  Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from  Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. 1  Material suppliers: Surveys have been conducted since fiscal 2014 for suppliers  accounting for more than 80% of our procurement spend. 2 Staffing suppliers: Surveys have been conducted since fiscal 2019 on 100% of  employment agencies and contracting companies (internal contractors). Procurement BCP As part of our business continuity plans (BCPs), we collaborate  with suppliers for disaster preparation.  We maintain a database of suppliers’ production sites so that  if a crisis arises, we can promptly identify impacted suppliers and  quickly collaborate in recovery efforts. In addition, we conduct  BCP assessments on our suppliers, analyze their responses and  provide them with feedback to promote further improvement. 3 Logistics suppliers: Surveys have been conducted since fiscal 2019 on 100% of  customs-related operators. 5  CMRT: Conflict Minerals Reporting Template. Survey format for reporting conflict  materials, provided by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI), which has established  international guidelines on conflict minerals. emphasis in the RBA Code of Conduct. In addition, with respect  to cases of false reporting, changes were made in business  processes and audits were introduced.  Regarding the human rights issue of “freely chosen  employment”, we have expressly stipulated our zero tolerance  policy for forced labor and bonded labor, and by communicating  this to our major suppliers, we are promoting initiatives to ensure  that all people in our supply chain can work of their own free will. Diversity and Inclusion At Tokyo Electron, diversity and inclusion are management pillars  that lead to the continuous generation of innovation and  increased corporate value. We are actively pursuing them with  the strong commitment of our management. Employees Both Create and Fulfill Company Values A total of 14,479 employees are working at the 76 Tokyo Electron  sites located in 18 countries and regions of the world, and we  believe that each of them maintaining a high level of  engagement and demonstrating their full potential will lead  directly to our company’s growth. By sharing with our employees  the direction toward which management is aiming and providing  platforms for direct dialogue through the employee meetings  and discussions held every year at each site, we are striving to  build mutual trust between the organization and individuals.  Furthermore, to realize our Corporate Philosophy, we established  TEL Values, which delineate Tokyo Electron’s values, the mindset  that each employee must possess and the codes of conduct to  be passed on to the future. The TEL Values—pride, challenge,  ownership, teamwork and awareness—are being put into Although the areas of emphasis for diversity and inclusion  vary by country, we have taken on gender and nationality as  major themes and put the following goals and initiatives in place  based on the characteristics of each region. practice by our employees all over the world. We have established TEL UNIVERSITY as an in-house  educational establishment, helping employees to independently  build their careers and realize their personal goals for their  growth and development. Our aim is to stand shoulder to  shoulder with each employee, supporting their self-growth and  fruitful career development throughout their working life, and  create a foundation that enables the organization and individuals  to trust each other and grow. We are focusing on employee  growth that leads to corporate growth through the following  four initiatives: Provision of Personalized Learning Opportunities,  Support for Career Development, Leader Programs, and  Provision of Global Learning Opportunities. Employee Engagement Improving employee engagement is essential to maximize  corporate performance and achieve sustainable growth.  Recognizing that employees both create and fulfill company  values for us, we have been regularly conducting engagement  surveys since fiscal 2016 to assess the current state of employee  engagement and identify issues. Based on the results of the  surveys, our management takes the lead in making  improvements to foster a better workplace environment and  culture. These initiatives resulted in an increase in the employee  engagement score of 12 points from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2021 and  a turnover rate of 2.5%.  We plan to continue these initiatives since we believe that  improving employee engagement leads to providing increased  value to our stakeholders. Initiatives for Quality Improvement  In order to help each of our employees correctly understand   and implement quality assurance activities, we realize the  importance of correctly defining the ideal form of quality  assurance (goals), along with creating an environment and  culture for widely disseminating it. From the ideal form, we  established “Our Approach to Quality” and “Quality Policy” and  communicate the importance of quality to our employees at  various opportunities to increase their quality awareness. To  carry out correct quality assurance activities, it is important to  establish clear rules for what has to be done and correctly  implement those rules. To ensure that our employees are always  aware of their roles and purposes and correctly perform their  work, we are striving to make the rules comprehensive, reassess  and deploy our quality education from time to time and  visualize appropriate quality information. Based on these  foundations, we help our employees mutually enhance  awareness about quality in a variety of situations so that their  efforts lead to the improvement and growth of our business  processes, enabling us to provide product quality and services  that surpass customer expectations. Approach to Quality We have defined our approach to quality as follows: “The Tokyo Electron Group seeks to provide the highest-  quality products and services. This pursuit of quality begins at  development and continues through all manufacturing,  installation, maintenance, sales and support processes. employees must work to deliver quality products, quality  services and innovative solutions that enable customer success”. Quality Focus Focusing on quality to satisfy customers, meet production  schedules and reduce required maintenance even with  temporary cost increases. 2. Quality Design and Assurance Building quality into products and assuring in-process quality  control, from the design and development phase throughout  every process. 3. Quality and Trust When a quality-related problem occurs, working as a team to  perform thorough root cause analyses and resolve problems  as quickly as possible. 4. Continual Improvement Ensuring customer satisfaction and trust by establishing  quality goals and performance indicators and by implementing  continual improvement using the PDCA cycle. 5. Stakeholder Communication Listening to stakeholder expectations, providing timely  product quality information and making adjustments  as needed. We strive to implement own-process assurance systems by  carrying out strict risk management and development/design  inspections beginning at the development stage, and also by  ensuring verification of customers’ operations using simulations.  We have also built an important component traceability system  as part of our effort to strengthen our information environment.  By making it possible to use the One Platform1 to view such  information as past problems and adjustment values used during  manufacturing and assembly, as well as important component  inspection information from suppliers, we have successfully  strengthened our risk management (FMEA2) to prevent various  types of non-conformance. We believe that thorough implementation of these own- process assurance systems and prevention makes it possible for  employees to focus on high-value-added business operations  and promote initiatives that lead to Shift Left (front-loading). We  will continue to strive to provide high-quality and high-value- added products and services to our customers. 2  FMEA: Failure mode and effects analysis. Method to identify, prevent and mitigate risks  in advance. We are currently introducing a new enterprise system (ERP*) to  improve productivity and quality further. The new ERPs, being  integrated across operational and national boundaries, are aimed  at creating the following five benefits: (1) compliance with the  new revenue recognition standards in Japan; (2) business and  management decision making with quick response to change;  (3) large improvements in business operation efficiency;  (4) utilization of globally integrated information with an eye  toward overall digital transformation; and (5) realization of  ultimate work style reform. Beginning with business operational  improvement, we are contributing to the resolution of issues  from COVID-19 with global progress in the expansion of  telecommuting, the shift to online approval operations, and  overall digitalization. * ERP: Enterprise resource planning. A system that integrates the core business  operations of an enterprise, such as accounting, personnel, production, logistics and  sales, for better efficiency and centralized information. In fiscal 2021, we made progress in communication and  consensus-building that included our headquarters,  manufacturing sites in Japan, and overseas subsidiaries, as well as  partner companies, to form a globally unified team toward  business innovation. In May 2021, the new ERPs began operation,  primarily at our headquarters. While making the most of the  knowledge gained from this process and the results, we plan to  realize a true globally integrated system, with project members  and all our employees working as one. Corporate Governance Framework With over 80% of our sales coming from overseas, we regard  building governance structure as essential in order to achieve  success in global competition and sustainable growth. To that  end, we have built a framework to maximize use of worldwide  resources, and have worked to incorporate a wide range of  opinions to strengthen our management foundation and  technology base, establishing a governance structure capable of  ensuring that we attain global-level earnings power. We have  also established the Corporate Governance Guidelines* which  outline this governance structure. We use the Audit & Supervisory Board System, which consists  of a Board of Directors and an Audit & Supervisory Board, and  has achieved effective governance based on the supervision of management by the Audit & Supervisory Board. Furthermore, in  addition to the Board of Directors, whose role is to make major  operational decisions and play a supervisory role in the executive  management’s execution, and support appropriate risk-taking  by them, we have established systems that facilitate growth- oriented governance directed at sustainable growth, including  the following: (1) the Nomination Committee and Compensation  Committee to ensure fair, effective, and transparent  management; (2) the Corporate Senior Staff (CSS) to formulate  and advance company strategy; and (3) the Business Execution  Meeting, to play a role in deliberations of the executive  management. * Corporate Governance Guidelines: www.tel.com/about/cg/ Policies for Allocation of Earnings Our basic stance is for the appropriate allocation of company  earnings to all stakeholders.  Our dividend policy to shareholders is to link dividend  payments to business performance on an ongoing basis and  maintain a payout ratio of around 50% based on net income  attributable to owners of the parent company. Furthermore, we  also set the minimum annual dividend at 150 yen per share in  light of the stable distribution of dividends.  We effectively use internal capital reserves to raise corporate  value through earnings growth by concentrating investment in  high-growth areas and provide returns directly to shareholders  by linking dividend payments to business performance.  Furthermore, we flexibly consider implementing repurchases of  treasury stocks as part of returning earnings to shareholders. Establishment of the Director Compensation System As our basic policies on executive compensation, we emphasize  (1) levels and plans for compensation to secure highly competent  management personnel with global competitiveness; (2) high  linkage with business performance in the short term and  medium- and long-term increase of corporate value aimed at  sustainable growth; and (3) securement of transparency and  fairness in the decision process of compensation and  appropriateness of compensation. Compensation for inside directors consists of fixed basic  compensation, annual performance-linked compensation  and medium-term performance-linked compensation.  Compensation for outside directors consists of fixed basic  compensation and non-performance-linked (stock-based)  compensation. Compensation for Audit & Supervisory Board  members consists solely of fixed basic compensation in  consideration of their role being primarily the audit and  supervision of management. In order to secure transparency and fairness in management  and appropriateness of compensation, the Compensation  Committee, which an independent outside director chairs,  utilizes advice from an external expert, compares compensation  levels with those of industry peers in Japan and overseas, and  analyzes the latest trends and best practices in Japan and  overseas (such as reflecting ESG in compensation). The  committee then proposes to the Board of Directors a  compensation policy for corporate directors, a compensation  system that is globally competitive and the most appropriate  for us, and individual compensation amounts for the  representative directors. Fixed Basic Compensation Fixed basic compensation is determined in reference to the  compensation standards of industry peers in Japan and overseas.  For inside directors, it also depends on the scale of their  responsibilities based on the job grade framework provided by  the external specialist organization. Annual Performance-linked Compensation Annual performance-linked compensation consists of cash  bonuses and stock compensation-based stock options at a ratio  of approximately 1:1. The specific amounts paid and the numbers  of stock options granted are determined based on the results of  corporate business performance and individual performance  evaluations for the relevant fiscal year. Net income attributable  to owners of parent and consolidated ROE are adopted as  evaluation indicators for corporate business performance.  Evaluation items for individual performance include the degree  of contribution to short-term and medium-term management  strategy targets (including ESG). Medium-term Performance-linked Compensation Medium-term performance-linked compensation is a  performance share (stock-based) compensation to motivate  recipients to contribute to improving medium-term business  performance and raise awareness for enhancing corporate value  by sharing the perspective of shareholders through the holding  of shares. The number of shares issued to each corporate  director varies according to the payout rate based on their  respective responsibilities and level of performance goal  achievement over the relevant three-year period. Consolidated  operating margin and consolidated ROE have been adopted as  the indicators for measuring the levels of performance goal  achievement which are linked to the Medium-term  Management Plan. Non-performance-linked (Stock-based) Compensation  Non-performance-linked stock-based compensation has been  introduced for the purpose of making the compensation system  for outside directors more consistent with their expected role of,  in addition to supervising management, giving advice to  management from the perspective of increasing corporate value  over the medium to long term. Under this stock-based  compensation system, shares are granted after the expiration of  the applicable period (three fiscal years) which is set each year. Process for Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors and Management Issues To evaluate the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, including  the Nomination Committee and Compensation Committee, we  conduct questionnaire surveys of all corporate directors and  Audit & Supervisory Board members, as well as individual  interviews with some corporate directors and Audit &  Supervisory Board members. We also conduct opinion  exchanges and deliberations with a group comprised mostly of  outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members. The  results of this questionnaire, summaries of interviews and the  content of deliberations are then shared with the entire Board of  Directors before deliberating and comprehensively evaluating  the effectiveness of the Board of Directors. We appoint a third  party to provide advice on setting assessment items and to conduct, aggregate and analyze the interviews in an effort to  increase objectivity. In terms of the evaluation results in fiscal 2021, open and  dynamic discussions were held at Board of Directors meetings  and off-site meetings. We recognize that the Board of Directors,  including the Nomination Committee and Compensation  Committee, is functioning in an effective manner. In light of the results of this evaluation, we will continue our  efforts to have fuller discussions regarding medium- to long- term management strategies, promote diversity, strengthen  group governance at a global level and share appropriate  information with the Nomination Committee, Compensation  Committee and Board of Directors. mandate from our stakeholders. We believe that our corporate  directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members have the  necessary qualifications to realize these initiatives.  Described in detail below, all of them have knowledge of  global business, governance, sustainability and so on. In  addition to this matrix of individual skills, we also disclose the  overall diversity of our Board of Directors in an easy-to- understand format.

The most important duty of Tokyo Electron’s Board of  Directors is making decisions on important matters toward  enhancing short-, medium- and long-term shareholder value.  In fiscal 2021, we achieved the highest net sales and operating  income in our corporate history. This was due in large part to  the tremendous effort of our executive management and  employees. At the same time, I also recognize that the Board  of Directors maintained a high level of effectiveness and  made decisions on important directions and strategies after  wide-ranging discussions, all of which also contributed to our  good performance. Priority issues for further growth, medium- to long-term  management strategies and initiatives regarding  sustainability were also discussed and deliberated in depth. All  corporate directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members  engaged in discussions based on their diverse insights and  experience with a global perspective and strong awareness of  Tokyo Electron’s corporate culture to arrive at our directions  for growth and many important resolutions. Through our discussions about short-, medium- and long- term value creation, we made the decision to issue the  Integrated Report starting from this year in addition to our  annual Sustainability Report to allow us to accurately  communicate these initiatives to our stakeholders. Japan’s Corporate Governance Code was revised in June 2021,  and the Tokyo Stock Exchange will also be carrying out a  transition to new market segments (Prime, Standard and  Growth) in April 2022. To further improve the effectiveness  of the Board of Directors, we are also working on initiatives  for the new recommended items in the revised Corporate  Governance Code. Together with the introduction of a skills  matrix for corporate directors, we are also overseeing  successor training plans as appropriate. In addition, we seek  to strengthen diversity by positioning the development and  appointment of global human resources and the promotion  of gender diversity as key issues that must be addressed. As  for the important matter of risk management, we will  broadly identify risks on a company-wide basis, including  overseas sites, and respond to them appropriately. At the  same time, we will evolve and further strengthen our  Group’s governance. To correctly grasp the trends of the rapidly growing global ICT  industry, meet the expectations of the capital market, achieve  sustainable growth and improve our medium- to long-term  corporate value, our Board of Directors will undertake  management with world-class effectiveness so as to always  make the best decisions at the right time regarding important  management issues. Approach to Compliance To practice Tokyo Electron’s Corporate Philosophy, it is vital that  each employee performs their daily duties with strong interest in  and a deep understanding of compliance. We established “Tokyo  Electron’s Code of Ethics” as a code of conduct to ensure that our  employees are aware of the risks around them and conduct  themselves appropriately. We have built a global system that can  directly raise questions and concerns about compliance and  business ethics to quickly address potential problems. Compliance System In order to effectively promote a global compliance program, we  have appointed a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and  established a dedicated Compliance Department at our  headquarters. Additionally, people responsible for compliance  (Regional Compliance Controllers) have been appointed at key  overseas sites, creating a system for direct reporting to the Chief  Compliance Officer and Compliance Department. Compliance Initiatives Business Ethics In addition to establishing the Code of Ethics as standards of  conduct by which executives and employees should abide and  distributing it in the form of booklets, we also strive for  understanding and awareness by regularly obtaining  confirmation of compliance from all executives and employees.  In fiscal 2021, we made a full-fledged revision on the content to  what is required as a global company and changed the booklet  design to make it easier to understand. Initiatives for Anti-Bribery and Corruption and for  Competition Laws We have established the “Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption  Policy” as well as the “Gifts and Entertainment Guidelines”, and  the “Global Competition Law Policy” and the “Guidelines”. In  addition, we also regularly conduct training to promote  understanding and awareness. Internal Reporting System Preventing problems from occurring and resolving them before  they become significant requires a system that allows employees  to raise questions and concerns about business ethics and  compliance without reservation or hesitation and to discuss  them fully. For this reason, we have established an internal  reporting system that ensures complete confidentiality,  anonymity and the prohibition of retribution, so that employees  can safely and reassuringly provide information and seek redress  outside the chain of command about behavior that is, or may be,  in violation of laws, regulations or business ethics. Specifically, we have established and are operating the Tokyo  Electron Group Ethics & Compliance Hotline—a global common  internal point of contact that uses a third-party system that is  also accessible to our suppliers—as well as an external point of  contact that allows direct consultation with an outside law firm. Reports and consultations received via these points of  contact are handled with sincerity and investigations are  undertaken in accordance with internal regulations. If a  compliance violation is found, disciplinary action is taken in  accordance with the Rules of Employment, and preventive  measures and corrective measures, such as improvements to the  workplace environment, are implemented as necessary. Relevant Divisions, etc. Report and Sales Installation and Maintenance Services Risk Management System and Initiatives In order to promote more effective risk management, we carry  out enterprise risk management1 through a body established  within the General Affairs Department at our headquarters. This  body works with the respective departments responsible for  each operation to identify a wide range of risks arising in business  activities, such as compliance risk, human resource and labor risk,  and business continuity risk. It then classifies risks with high  impact and probability as our key risks. The body also formulates and executes measures to minimize  these key risks, monitors the effect of said measures, as well as  works to understand the status of risk control, and implements  the PDCA cycle for risk management. In fiscal 2021 we introduced CSA2 and started a risk  management committee. We will continue these activities going  forward.

In the electronics industry, where Tokyo Electron operates, the  market for semiconductor production equipment is expanding  as demand for semiconductors increases, driven by the transition  to a data-driven society due to the expansion of the use of  information and communication technologies (ICT) such as IoT, AI  and 5G. Although it will be necessary to continue to monitor the  impact of COVID-19, the market for semiconductor production  equipment is expected to grow further. In this environment, the consolidated operating results for  fiscal 2021 were as follows.  Net sales for the fiscal year increased 24.1% from the previous  fiscal year to 1,399.1 billion yen. Domestic net sales increased  22.1% from the previous year to 197.5 billion yen, while overseas  net sales increased 24.5% to 1,201.5 billion yen to account for 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 799.7 40.3 42.0 41.2 40.1 40.4 1,130.7 1,278.2 1,127.2 1,399.1 Operating Income and Operating Margin Operating Income (Billions of yen)              Operating Margin (%) 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 155.6 19.5 310.5 281.1 24.9 24.3 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 85.9% of net sales. Cost of sales increased 23.5% to 834.1 billion yen and gross  profit increased 25.0% to 564.9 billion yen. As a result, the gross  profit margin expanded by 0.3 points to 40.4%. Selling, general  and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 13.8% to 244.2  billion yen, while the ratio to consolidated net sales declined by  1.6 points to 17.5%.　 As a result, operating income increased 35.1% to 320.6 billion  yen and operating margin increased 1.9 points to 22.9%. After  netting of non-operating income of 5.4 billion yen and non- operating expenses of 4.0 billion yen, ordinary income increased  31.5% to 322.1 billion yen. Income before income taxes was 317.0  billion yen (year-on-year growth of 29.6%) and net income  attributable to owners of parent was 242.9 billion yen (year-on- year growth of 31.2%).  As a result, net income per share was 1,562.20 yen compared  to net income per share of 1,170.57 yen in the previous fiscal year. 237.2 21.0 22.9 320.6 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 115.2 19.1 248.2 204.3 29.0 30.1 185.2 21.8 26.5 242.9 Total net assets 645,999 771,509 888,117 829,692 1,024,562 Total liabilities 311,447 431,287 369,510 448,802 400,801 Total current liabilities 247,770 368,452 304,882 382,578 327,661 Total assets 957,447 1,202,796 1,257,627 1,278,495 1,425,364 Note:  From fiscal 2019, the Company applied the Accounting Standards Board of Japan’s “Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting” (ASBJ Statement No. 28,  revised on February 16, 2018). Total current assets, total investments and other assets, total assets and total liabilities for fiscal 2018 have been restated in accordance with the  revised accounting standard Total current assets at the end of fiscal 2021 were 1,015.6 billion yen,  an increase of 53.2 billion yen compared to the end of the previous  fiscal year. This was mainly due to an increase of 41.5 billion yen in  trade notes and accounts receivable, an increase of 36.6 billion yen  in cash and deposits, an increase of 23.2 billion yen in inventories,  and a decrease of 44.8 billion yen in short-term investments.  Net property, plant and equipment increased by 21.3 billion  yen from the end of the previous fiscal year, to 196.9 billion yen.  Investments and other assets increased by 72.2 billion yen from  the end of the previous fiscal year, to 212.6 billion yen. As a result, total assets increased by 146.8 billion yen from the  end of the previous fiscal year, to 1,425.3 billion yen. Total current liabilities decreased by 54.9 billion yen from the  end of the previous fiscal year, to 327.6 billion yen. This was largely  due to a decrease in customer advances of 53.6 billion yen.  Total non-current liabilities increased by 6.9 billion yen from  the end of the previous fiscal year, to 73.1 billion yen.  Total net assets increased by 194.8 billion yen from the end  of previous fiscal year, to 1,024.5 billion yen. This was largely due  to an increase of 242.9 billion yen in net income attributable  to owners of parent, a decrease resulting from the payment of  109.5 billion yen in year-end dividends for the previous fiscal year  and an interim dividend for fiscal 2021, and an increase of 45.9  billion yen in net unrealized gains on investment securities. As a  result, the equity ratio was 71.1%. 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 Cash Flows Cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal 2021 increased by  18.0 billion yen compared to the end of the previous fiscal year,  to 265.9 billion yen. The combined balance including 45.5 billion  yen in time deposits and short-term investments with maturities  of more than three months that are not included in cash and  cash equivalents was 311.5 billion yen, a decrease of 26.8 billion  yen from the end of the previous fiscal year. The overall situation  regarding cash flows for the fiscal year was as described below. Cash flows from operating activities were positive 145.8  billion yen, a decrease of 107.2 billion yen compared to the same  period of the previous fiscal year. The major positive factors were  317.0 billion yen in income before income taxes, 33.8 billion yen  in depreciation and amortization. The major negative factors  were 87.7 billion yen in payment of income taxes, a decrease in  customer advances of 54.8 billion yen, an increase in trade notes  and accounts receivable of 37.7 billion yen, and an increase in  inventories of 17.2 billion yen. Cash flows from investing activities were negative 18.2 billion  yen compared to positive 15.9 billion yen in the same period of  the previous fiscal year. This was largely due to the payment  of 53.8 billion yen for the purchase of property, plant and  equipment, and an inflow of 44.9 billion yen from a decrease in  short-term investments. Cash flows from financing activities were negative 114.5 billion  yen compared to negative 250.3 billion yen in the same period of  the previous fiscal year. This was largely due to the payment of  109.5 billion yen in dividends. Our operating results for fiscal 2021 were a record-high  1,399.1 billion yen, an increase of 24.1% from the previous fiscal  year, due to active capital expenditure by customers in both  the semiconductor and flat panel display (FPD) production  equipment markets. Together with the significant increase in net sales, operating  income also reached 320.6 billion yen, an increase of 35.1% from  the previous fiscal year, and the operating margin was 22.9%,  an increase of 1.9 points from the previous fiscal year. This was  mainly due to the increase in gross profit margin from the  increase in net sales of key fields, and the decrease in the ratio  of selling, general and administrative expenses arising from the  increase in net sales. Total R&D expenses increased by 16.3 billion  yen (13.6%) from the previous fiscal year to a record-high of 136.6  billion yen in order to achieve the financial model of the Medium- term Management Plan as well as to achieve further growth in  the future. Net income attributable to owners of parent—which  is operating income with non-operating profit and loss  and unusual or infrequent profit and loss reflected less tax  expenses—was 242.9 billion yen, and its ratio against net sales  was 17.4%, an increase of 1.0 points from the previous fiscal year.  Net income per share was 1,562.20 yen due to the increase in  profits as well as the impact of the purchase of treasury stock  conducted in the previous fiscal year. The following is our understanding, analysis and consideration  about the state of operating results for each segment. Please note  that segment profit corresponds to income before income taxes on  the consolidated statements of income. 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 166.5 20.8 17.1 16.9 19.1 193.8 214.6 215.6 244.2 17.5 R&D Expenses and Ratio to Net Sales R&D Expenses (Billions of yen)              Ratio to Net Sales (%) 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 83.8 10.5 8.6 8.9 10.7 120.2 113.9 •Semiconductor Production Equipment Due to the expanded use of ICT mentioned above, capital  expenditure in semiconductors for logic/foundry has been  robust in a wide range of areas, from the leading-edge to mature  generations of semiconductors. In addition, capital expenditure  in NAND increased significantly during fiscal 2021, reflecting  the transition to a data-driven society. Furthermore, capital  expenditure in DRAM that had been adjusted also started to  recover due to an improvement in the supply and demand  balance toward the second half of fiscal 2021. Consequently,  net sales in this segment during the fiscal 2021 were 1,315.2  billion yen (year-on-year growth of 24.0%). Segment profit was  362.5 billion yen, an increase of 34.0% from the previous fiscal  year. Amid active capital expenditure by customers on new  equipment, as a result of smooth progress in sales strategies  within key fields, net sales in fiscal 2021 increased significantly,  especially in sales for logic/foundry and NAND. In addition, net  sales for used equipment and modifications as well as parts and  services also grew steadily due to the increase in cumulative  number of equipment installed and high equipment utilization  by customers. Segment profit margin was 27.6% in fiscal 2021, an increase of  2.1 points from 25.5% in the previous fiscal year. This was mainly  due to the decrease in the ratio of fixed costs arising from the  significant increase in net sales. •FPD Production Equipment The FPD production equipment market underwent positive  growth year-on-year, with an increase in capital expenditure  in small- to medium-sized OLED panels for mobile devices  in addition to robust capital expenditure in large-sized LCD  panels for televisions. Consequently, net sales in this segment during the fiscal 2021 were 83.7 billion yen (year-on-year  growth of 26.8%). Segment profit was 8.8 billion yen, a 136.6 20.6 17.8 Capital Expenditures (Billions of yen)               Depreciation and Amortization (Billions of yen) 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 45.6 20.6 49.7 24.3 54.6 29.1 53.8 decrease of 16.7% from the previous fiscal year. The significant  growth in this segment’s net sales was due to the increase in  capital expenditure on small- to medium-sized OLED panels  for mobile devices as well as robust capital expenditure on  large-sized LCD panels for televisions. Segment profit margin was 10.5% in fiscal 2021, a decrease of  5.5 points from 16.0% in the previous fiscal year. This was mainly  due to inventories—manufactured during the previous fiscal  year when our plant utilization rate was temporary low—being  realized as cost of sales in fiscal 2021. Regarding our financial conditions, total assets stood at 1,425.3  billion yen at the end of fiscal 2021, an increase of 146.8 billion  yen from the end of the previous fiscal year. This was mainly  due to the increase in trade notes and accounts receivable,  inventories, property, plant and equipment, and investment  securities included in investments and other assets. Trade notes  and accounts receivable reached 191.7 billion yen, an increase of  41.5 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year, due to the  significant increase in net sales during the fourth quarter against  the backdrop of rapid growth in the market for semiconductor  production equipment. Inventories reached 415.3 billion yen, an  increase of 23.2 billion yen from the end of the previous fiscal year,  in reflection of the robust demand for equipment and parts— which will continue into the following fiscal year—as well as a  result of incorporating measures such as leveling of production. Net property, plant and equipment increased 21.3 billion yen  year-on-year to 196.9 billion yen, in reflection of the completion  of new buildings at our Yamanashi and Tohoku plants aimed 702.26 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 1,245.48 1,513.58 1,170.57 1,562.20  (Yen) Note:  Segment profit corresponds to income before  income taxes on the consolidated statements of  income. 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 749.8 24.4 1,060.9 1,166.7 1,055.2 29.8 28.0 25.5 27.6 at enhancing our production capacities, as well as other works  such as the ongoing construction of the Technology Innovation  Center at our Miyagi plant. Investment securities increased 66.6 billion yen year-on- year to 105.0 billion yen due to the higher market prices of  strategically-held listed shares. Due to these factors, total assets  increased since the end of the previous fiscal year, but as the  increase in net sales was greater, the turnover period for total  assets decreased from 414 days in the previous fiscal year to 372  days, improving asset efficiency. Regarding cash flows, the balance of cash and cash  equivalents including deposits and short-term investments with  original maturities of more than three months decreased 26.8  billion yen year-on-year to 311.5 billion yen. This was mainly due  to a concentration of equipment shipments in the fourth quarter  of the previous fiscal year and a portion of payments from  customers for sales in fiscal 2021 being recognized as customer  advances in the previous fiscal year. Given that the required working capital is increasing, such as  an increasing level of inventories due to business expansion, we  continued to invest in growth, including the enhancement of our  production capabilities in preparation for higher demand and  research and development. At the same time, we returned 109.5  billion yen to our shareholders based on our shareholder return  policy of a 50% dividend payout ratio. These were all covered  using cash on hand obtained through business operations.  We will continue to undertake investments for future growth  and aggressive shareholder return while maintaining our solid  financial foundation built through high profit margins. Return on equity (ROE), one of our management indicators,  increased from 21.8% in the previous fiscal year to 26.5%,  improving capital efficiency. This was due to the increase in the  ratio of net income attributable to owners of parent against net  sales as well as the decrease in the turnover period for total assets. 1,315.2 Note:  Segment profit corresponds to income before  income taxes on the consolidated statements of  income. 2017.3 2018.3 2019.3 2020.3 2021.3 49.3 9.4 75.0 58 TOKYO ELECTRON Integrated Report 2021 111.2 21.8 66.0 16.0 83.7 1  From fiscal 2015, Electronic components and computer networks were excluded because Tokyo Electron Device Limited, a former consolidated subsidiary, became an equity method  affiliate.

Tokyo Electron Limited and Subsidiaries Years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 Millions of yen Thousands of   U.S. dollars Basis of Presentation of Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of  Tokyo Electron Limited (hereinafter “the Company”) and its  subsidiaries (hereinafter collectively referred to as “Tokyo  Electron”) have been prepared in accordance with the  provisions set forth in the Financial Instruments and Exchange  Act of Japan and its related accounting regulations, and in  conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in  Japan, which are different in certain respects as to application  and disclosure requirements of International Financial  Reporting Standards. The Company uses financial statements prepared by foreign  subsidiaries in accordance with International Financial Reporting  Standards or U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements,  together with adjustment for certain items which are required to  be adjusted in the consolidation process. The accompanying consolidated financial statements  have been restructured and translated into English from the  statutory Japanese language consolidated financial statements.  Some supplementary information included in the statutory  Japanese language consolidated financial statements is  not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial  statements. The amounts in the consolidated financial statements and  associated notes shown in millions and thousands of yen;  thousands of U.S. dollars; and thousands of shares as of and for  the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 are truncated at the  nearest unit. Accordingly, totals do not necessarily agree with the  sum of the corresponding individual amounts. U.S. dollar amounts included herein are solely for the  convenience of readers and are presented at the rate of  ¥110.71 to $1.00, the approximate rate as of March 31, 2021. The  translation should not be construed as a representation that  the Japanese yen amounts shown could be converted into U.S.  dollars at that or any other rate. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts  of the Company and its 27 and 29 subsidiaries as of March 31,  2021 and 2020, respectively. All significant inter-company  transactions and account balances have been eliminated  through consolidation procedures. There are 9 affiliates accounted for using the equity method  as of March 31, 2021 and 2020.  The fiscal year-end of all entities is March 31, except for  3 consolidated foreign subsidiaries. Financial statements  provisionally closed for the period ending March 31 are used for  those subsidiaries. (b) Foreign currency translation All assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  are translated into Japanese yen at the year-end rates, except  for those hedged by forward exchange contracts, which are  translated at the contracted rates. Resulting exchange gains and losses are included in earnings for the year. Revenue and expense items are translated at the rates that  approximate those prevailing at the time of the transactions. The balance sheet accounts of foreign subsidiaries are  translated into Japanese yen at the rates of exchange in effect at  the balance sheet date, except for shareholders’ equity accounts,  which are translated at the historical rates. Revenue and expense  accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated at average rates  of exchange in effect during the year. Resulting translation  adjustments are presented in net assets as a component  of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the  consolidated balance sheets. (c) Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, short term  deposits and low-risk financial instruments with original  maturities of three months or less. (d) Short-term investments Short-term investments consist of short term deposits and  low-risk financial instruments with original maturities of more  than three months. (e) Investment securities Tokyo Electron examines the intent of holding each security  and classifies those securities as trading securities, held-to  maturity debt securities or other securities. Tokyo Electron has  no trading securities as of March 31, 2021 and 2020. Held-to- maturity debt securities are stated mainly at amortized cost.  Other securities with market prices are valued at fair value at the  balance sheet date. The differences between the book value and  fair value of other securities, net of applicable income taxes, are  presented in net assets as a component of accumulated other  comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated balance sheets.  Other securities without market prices are valued at cost using  the weighted-average method. The cost of sold securities is calculated using the weighted  average method. (f) Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, determined by  principally the specific identification method, or net selling  price, which is defined as selling price less estimated additional  manufacturing costs and estimated direct selling expenses. (g) Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation of buildings, machinery and equipment of the  Company and its domestic subsidiaries is computed using  the declining-balance method, except for buildings acquired  since April 1, 1998 and facilities attached to buildings and  structures acquired since April 1, 2016 which are depreciated  using the straight-line method, based on the estimated  useful lives of assets. Foreign subsidiaries mainly apply the  straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of  assets. (h) Intangible assets (excluding goodwill) Intangible assets are amortized by the straight-line method  over their estimated useful lives. (i) Goodwill Goodwill is evaluated on an individual basis and amortized by  the straight-line method over a period not exceeding 20 years. (j) Impairment of fixed assets Tokyo Electron evaluates the carrying value of fixed assets  held for use in the business and idle assets. If the carrying value of a fixed asset is impaired, a loss is  recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value  exceeds its recoverable amount, being the higher of the net  selling price or the value in use of the assets. Net selling price  is determined using the fair value less disposal costs and value  in use is based on the total amount of discounted cash flows  estimated to be generated from the continuing use of the  individual assets or the asset group and the disposal of the  assets. (k) Allowance for doubtful accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts is provided at an  amount determined based on the historical experience of bad  debts with respect to ordinary receivables, and an estimate  of uncollectible amounts determined by reference to specific  doubtful receivables from customers which are experiencing  financial difficulties. (l) Accrued employees’ bonuses The provision for accrued employees’ bonuses is provided  based on the estimated payments to be made in respect of the  fiscal year. (m) Employee benefits The Company and its domestic subsidiaries provide defined  benefit plans for their employees. Expected benefits are  attributed to accounting periods by the benefit formula basis.  Prior service costs are charged to earnings on a straight-line  basis, beginning from the fiscal year in which they are incurred,  over a fixed number of years (4 years) within the average  remaining years of service of employees when the changes  occur. Actuarial differences are charged to earnings on a  straight-line basis, beginning from the following fiscal year after  they are incurred, over a fixed number of years (4 years) within  the average remaining years of service of employees when the  differences occur. The provision for accrued pension and severance costs  for directors and audit & supervisory board members of  the Company and its domestic subsidiaries is calculated in  accordance with internal regulations. The Company and certain domestic subsidiaries decided to  discontinue the payment of severance pay for directors and  audit & supervisory board members after April 1, 2005, and at the  general shareholders’ meeting in June 2005, it was resolved that  the severance pay for directors and audit & supervisory board  members until March 31, 2005 would be paid at the termination  of their service and the decision regarding the payment amount  for each director and audit & supervisory board member was  delegated to the board of directors and audit & supervisory  board members. The accruals for severance costs for directors  and audit & supervisory board members are included in Net  defined benefit liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. (n) Accrued warranty expenses Tokyo Electron’s products are generally subject to warranty,  and Tokyo Electron accrues estimated warranty costs when  product revenue is recognized. Estimated after-sale repair  expenses over warranty periods are accrued based on the  historical ratio of actual repair expenses to corresponding sales. (o) Derivatives and hedge accounting The Company and certain subsidiaries (hereinafter “the  Group”)  make use of derivatives in order to manage certain risks  arising from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange  rates. The amount of derivatives is limited to the extent of  foreign currency assets, liabilities and actual orders or forecasted  transactions, and  the Group does not trade in derivatives for  speculative purposes. Derivatives are carried at fair value in the consolidated  balance sheets with changes in unrealized gain or loss charged  or credited to earnings, except for those which meet the criteria  for hedge accounting. Unrealized gains or losses on hedging  instruments, net of taxes, are reported in net assets as a  component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)  in the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables and payables  hedged by qualified forward foreign exchange contracts are  translated at the corresponding foreign exchange contract rates. (p) Income taxes Tokyo Electron records deferred tax assets and liabilities  on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of  assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the  amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss  carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured  using the enacted tax rates and laws which are expected to be  in effect when net operating loss carryforwards and temporary  differences are expected to be realized. (q) Revenue recognition Revenue from Semiconductor and FPD (Flat Panel Display)  production equipment is principally recognized at the time of  the customer confirmation of set-up and testing of products.  Revenue from equipment not requiring substantial installation  is recognized at the time of shipment. Service revenue for  maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the  maintenance contract. (r) Research and development expenses Research and development expenses are charged to earnings  as incurred and amounted to ¥136,648 million ($1,234,295  thousand) and ¥120,268 million for the years ended March 31,  2021 and 2020, respectively. (s) Reclassifications Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior  year’s consolidated financial statements to conform with the  presentation used for the year ended March 31, 2021. Tokyo Electron adopted “Accounting Standard for Disclosure  of Accounting Estimates” (ASBJ Statement No. 31, March 31,  2020) for the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal  year ended March 31, 2021 and, therefore, Significant Accounting  Estimates is presented as note 3. below.  The note does not  include information for the prior consolidated fiscal year in  accordance with the transitional provision set out in paragraph 11  of the Accounting Standard. Significant Accounting Estimates 1. Valuation of inventories (1)  Carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements as  of March 31, 2021 ¥415,344 million ($3,751,640 thousand) (2)  Information on the nature of significant accounting estimates  for identified items Inventories are principally stated at cost on the consolidated  balance sheet. When the net selling price for inventory decreases  below its cost at the end of the fiscal year, the Company writes  down inventories in an amount equal to the difference between  the cost of the inventory and the net selling price. Inventories aged over a certain holding period are classified  based on the use and salability and are then systematically  written down according to their classification. The carrying amount of inventories to be disposed of is  written down to the estimated disposal value. The valuation of inventories is based on forecasts of  future demand and prospects of market environment. The  semiconductor industry, where Tokyo Electron operates, is  influenced by the short-term unbalance between supply and  demand, and the market could undergo significant fluctuations.  Unforeseen rapid contraction of the semiconductor market  could lead to additional write downs of inventories in the  consolidated financial statements for the next fiscal year. Accrued warranty expenses (1)  Carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements as  of March 31, 2021 ¥14,415 million ($130,209 thousand) (2)  Information on the nature of significant accounting estimates  for identified items The Company accrues estimated warranty costs. Estimated  after-sale repair expenses over warranty periods are accrued  based on the historical ratio of actual repair expenses to corresponding sales. Tokyo Electron’s products are based on the integration  of numerous leading-edge technologies. The occurrence of  unforeseen defects could lead to additional after-sale repair  expenses in the consolidated financial statements for the next  fiscal year. 4.  Change in Accounting Policies and Adoption of New  Accounting Standards Year ended March 31, 2020 Certain consolidated overseas subsidiaries adopted IFRS 16  “Leases” from the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31,  2020, and recognize all leases as a lessee in principle as assets  and liabilities on the balance sheets. Tokyo Electron elected to use the transitional approach to  recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying this standard  at the date of initial application. Right-of-use assets were  recognized at the same value as lease liabilities and, therefore,  there was no impact on retained earnings at the beginning of the  fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The effect of this change on the consolidated financial  statements is immaterial. Additional Information Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to  Employees, etc. through Trusts Tokyo Electron introduced stock delivering schemes  (hereinafter “the Schemes”) from the fiscal year ended March  31, 2019 as a common global incentive plan. The purpose of the  Schemes is to encourage the directors of the Company and its  subsidiaries (excluding outside directors), executive officers  and senior and mid-level employees to contribute to improving  medium-term business performance, as well as to share a  shareholder perspective by holding Company shares and raising  awareness towards enhancing corporate value. For the Company’s outside directors, the Company has  introduced non-performance-linked stock-based compensation  from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 as a system that  is more consistent with their expected role of advising  management from the perspective of  increasing corporate value  over the medium- to long-term, in addition to management  supervision. In accordance with that objective, the Company  partially modified the Schemes and the Company’s outside  directors are now within the scope. Tokyo Electron adopted the “Practical Solution on  Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to  Employees, etc. through Trusts” (PITF No. 30, March 26, 2015) for  the accounting treatment of the Schemes. 1.  Executive compensation BIP (Board Incentive Plan) Trust (1) Overview of the transactions The Executive compensation BIP Trust which the Company  established acquires the Company’s shares, and delivers and  provides shares of the Company and monetary compensation  corresponding to the cash conversion value of the Company’s  shares to the directors of the Company and its subsidiaries in accordance with the share delivery rules. (2)  The Company’s shares held by the trust Tokyo Electron recorded the Company’s shares held by the  trust in “Treasury stock, at cost” under “Net assets” at the book  value in the trust (excluding ancillary expenses). The book value  and the number of such treasury shares were ¥1,744 million  ($15,757 thousand) and 80,538 shares, respectively, as of March  31, 2021, and were ¥1,154 million and 60,538 shares, respectively,   as of March 31, 2020. 2.  Share-delivering ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) Trust (1) Overview of the transactions The Share-delivering ESOP Trust which the Company  established acquires the Company’s shares, and delivers and  provides shares of the Company and monetary compensation  corresponding to the cash conversion value of the Company’s  shares to the general managers, senior employees and mid-class  employees of the Company and its subsidiaries based on their  position and attainment of performance targets in accordance  with the share delivery rules. (2) The Company’s shares held by the trust  Tokyo Electron recorded the Company’s shares held by the  trust in “Treasury stock, at cost” under “Net assets” at the book  value in the trust (excluding ancillary expenses). The book value  and the number of such treasury shares were ¥11,507 million  ($103,944 thousand) and 534,699 shares, respectively, as of  March 31, 2021, and were ¥7,840 million and 411,492 shares,  respectively,  as of March 31, 2020. Accounting Standards Issued but Not yet Adopted “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ  Statement No. 29, March 31, 2020 (hereinafter, “Statement  No.29”)) “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for  Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No. 30, March 26, 2021  (hereinafter, “Guidance No.30”)) “Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of  Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Guidance No. 19, March 31, 2020) (1) Overview The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the  U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) collaborated  on a project to develop a single, comprehensive revenue  recognition model and jointly issued new revenue recognition  standards “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (IFRS 15  published by IASB, ASC Topic 606 published by FASB) in May  2014. IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning  on or after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 is effective for annual  reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Considering the above circumstances, the Accounting  Standard Board of Japan (ASBJ) also developed a new revenue  recognition standard and issued Statement No.29 together with  Guidance No.30. ASBJ’s basic policy in developing the new revenue recognition standards is to first incorporate the core principle of IFRS 15 in  the light of improving the international comparability of financial  statements and then add additional alternative treatments  to the extent that international comparability would not be  impaired where any business practices operated in Japan need to  be considered. (2) Effective date Effective from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March  31, 2022. (3)  Effects of the application of the standards The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries are  currently in the process of determining the effects of these new  standards on the consolidated financial statements. “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ  Statement No. 30, July 4, 2019 (hereinafter, “Statement No.30”)) “Accounting Standard for Measurement of Inventories” (ASBJ  Statement No. 9, July 4, 2019) “Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” (ASBJ  Statement No. 10, July 4, 2019) “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair  Value Measurement” (ASBJ Guidance No. 31, July 4, 2019) “Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of  Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Guidance No. 19, March 31, 2020) (1) Overview The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the  U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have provided  similar detailed guidance for fair value measurement (IFRS 13  “Fair Value Measurement” published by IASB, ASC Topic 820 “Fair  Value Measurement” published by FASB). Considering the above circumstances, the Accounting  Standard Board of Japan (ASBJ) issued Statement No.30 and  the other standards above to enhance consistency between  Japanese accounting standards and international accounting  standards regarding guidance for fair value of financial  instruments and required disclosures. ASBJ’s basic policy in developing the new fair value  measurement standards is to basically incorporate all principles  of IFRS 13 in light of improving the international comparability of  financial statements by using a unified measuring method, and  then provide other treatments for individual items to the extent  that international comparability would not be significantly  impaired where any business practices operated in Japan need to  be considered. (2) Effective date Effective from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March  31, 2022. (3) Effects of the application of the standards The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries  have not determined the effects of these new standards on the  consolidated financial statements yet. Securities Other securities as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: Held-to-maturity securities classified as current assets are  ¥125,014 million ($1,129,207 thousand) and ¥188,500 million as of  March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, Tokyo Electron had unused  lines of credit amounting to ¥276,952 million ($2,501,604  thousand) and ¥126,929 million, respectively. Employee Benefits The Company and its domestic subsidiaries provide a cash  balance plan and a non-contributory retirement and severance  benefit plan as defined benefit plans, and provide a defined  contribution plan as defined contribution plans for their  employees. Further, certain consolidated overseas subsidiaries  provide defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans for  their employees.

Plan assets comprise: Discount rate 0.50% 0.55% Long-term expected rate of return 2.00% 2.00% Long-term expected rate of return Current and target asset allocations, and historical and  expected returns on the various categories of plan assets have  been considered in determining the long-term expected rate of  return. The expected rates of salary increase for the years ended  March 31, 2021 and 2020 are also considered as one of the  actuarial assumptions, and are set based on the salary increase  index by age group as of January 1, 2019. Defined contribution plans The contributions of the Company and its subsidiaries to the  defined contribution plans are ¥2,873 million ($25,954 thousand)  and ¥2,570 million for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020,  respectively. Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Income Taxes Significant components of the deferred tax assets and  liabilities as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent  upon the generation of future taxable income during the  period in which temporary differences become deductible and  net operating loss carryforwards are available to be utilized.  For assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets,  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred  tax liabilities, future estimated taxable income, tax planning  strategies and level of net operating loss carryforwards, if any,  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in  Japan. Based on the level of historical taxable income and future  estimated taxable income over the periods which the temporary  differences are deductible and net operating loss carryforwards  are available to be utilized, management believes Tokyo Electron  will realize the benefits of deferred tax assets, net of valuation  allowance, as of March 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries  apply a consolidated tax filing system for corporate tax purposes. The Company and its domestic subsidiaries calculated the  amounts of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  based on the Income Tax Act prior to amendment regarding  the transition to group tax sharing system established in “Act  for Partial Amendment of the Income Tax Act, etc. ” (Act No.8  of 2020) and the items for which the single tax payment  system was amended in line with the transition to group tax  sharing system, in accordance with the treatment specified  by paragraph 3 of “Practical Solution on the Treatment of Tax  Effect Accounting for the Transition from the Consolidated  Taxation System to the Group Tax Sharing System” (PITF No.39, Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars March 31, 2020) instead of the provision of paragraph 44 of  ”Implementation Guidance on Tax Effect Accounting” (ASBJ  Guidance No. 28, February 16, 2018). Significant components of the difference between the  statutory and effective tax rates for the years ended March 31,  2021 and 2020 are as follows: Statutory tax rate in Japan 30.62% 30.62% Adjustments: Tax credits (7.52) (5.96) Difference in statutory tax rates of subsidiaries (1.14) (1.52) Undistributed earnings of subsidiaries 0.74  0.25  Others, net 0.67  0.90  Effective tax rate 23.37% 24.29% Net Assets Net assets comprises four subsections, which are  shareholders’ equity, accumulated other comprehensive income,  share subscription rights and non-controlling interests. Under Japanese laws and regulations, the entire amount  paid for new shares is required to be designated as common  stock. However, a company may, by a resolution of the board of  directors, designate an amount not exceeding one half of the  price of the new shares as additional paid-in capital which is  included in capital surplus. In cases where dividend distribution of surplus is made, the  lesser of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if  any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in  capital and legal reserve must be set aside as additional paid- in capital or legal reserve. Legal reserve is included in retained  earnings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Both appropriations of legal reserve and additional paid-in  capital used to eliminate or reduce a deficit generally require a  resolution of the shareholders’ meeting. Additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may not be  distributed as dividends. All additional paid-in capital and legal  reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained  earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for  dividends. The Company is subject to restriction of dividends based  on the Japanese Corporate Act, which restricts the amount of  dividends to retained earnings on a consolidated basis. The Company’s articles allow for the distribution of earnings  to shareholders on dates other than the mid-term and year- end, by a resolution of the board of directors in accordance with  Japanese laws and regulations. At the board of directors’ meeting held on May 13, 2021, the  distribution of cash dividends amounting to ¥65,746 million  ($593,858 thousand) was resolved. Such appropriations have  not been accrued in the consolidated financial statements  as of March 31, 2021 since they are recognized in the period  in which they are resolved at the board of directors’ meeting.  The dividends of ¥65,746 million include ¥259 million ($2,339  thousand) related to treasury stock held by the BIP/ESOP Trusts. Other Comprehensive Income Other comprehensive income for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: 15.

Leases Future minimum lease payments on non-cancelable  operating leases are as follows: 17.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments Policy for financial instruments Tokyo Electron limits its fund management to short-term  bank deposits and low-risk financial instruments. Trade receivables, which consist of notes and accounts  receivable, are exposed to credit risk in the event of non- performance by the counterparties. Execution and management  of credit risk, maturity and receivable balance are conducted  pursuant to the internal management rules for credit control.  Credit risk of major customers is assessed on a regular basis. Expected residual period (Note 2) 5.49 years Expected dividends (Note 3) ¥ 673 ($6.08) per share Notes: 1.  Calculated based on the stock price performance for the period corresponding  to the expected residual period (from December 2014 to June 2020). 2.  Calculated based on past actual results and forecast of the exercise of stock  options. 3.  Based on the dividends paid for the years ended March 31, 2020   and 2019. 4.  Based on Japanese government bond yield corresponding to the   expected residual period. Volatility (Note 1) 36.18% Risk-free interest rate (Note 4) (0.12)% Note:  Certain consolidated overseas subsidiaries adopt IFRS 16 “Leases” . Accordingly,  leases as a lessee are not included in the amounts above, since they are now  recorded on the balance sheets in principle. Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Short-term investments consist of short term deposits and  low-risk financial instruments and Tokyo Electron trade with  highly-rated financial institutions to mitigate credit risks. Investment securities consist of mainly equity interests in  listed companies exposed to equity market risks. Conditions,  including market prices, for these investment securities are  monitored on a regular basis. Trade payables, which consist of notes and accounts payable,  mainly mature within one year. Trade payables are exposed to  liquidity risks which are managed through activities such as  implementing cash management plans. See note 18 for detailed discussion on derivative financial  instruments. Fair value of financial instruments Carrying amount and estimated fair value of financial  instruments as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 are set out below.  Fair value of financial instruments which is practically difficult to  estimate are excluded. Derivative Financial Instruments Tokyo Electron and certain subsidiaries are subject to risk  from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  in its operating and financing activities. The Group enters into Notes: 1. Fair value calculation of financial instruments Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, trade notes and accounts  receivable and trade notes and accounts payable.  The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of  these instruments. Investment securities The fair values of marketable securities are based on quoted market prices. See note 7 for further information by classification of investment securities. Derivatives See note 18 for detailed discussion on derivative financial instruments. 2.  The following financial instruments are not included in the above as they do not  have quoted market prices and therefore it is considered extremely difficult to  measure their fair value. 3.  Maturities of financial assets and securities are as follows: Millions of yen Thousands of  U.S. dollars Thousands of U.S. dollars Thousands of U.S. dollars Buy U.S. dollars 21,973  162  162  Buy Chinese yuan 2,105  (28) (28) Buy GBP 334  (1) (1) Buy Singapore dollars 303  0  0  Buy Taiwan dollars 45  1  1 forward foreign exchange contracts in order to hedge such risks,  but do not enter into such transactions for speculative purposes.  The Group implements a ratio analysis of the total cumulative  cash flow fluctuations to assess effectiveness of hedging for all  derivative transactions, except for transactions where the critical  terms of the hedging instrument and hedged item match and  the Group could conclude that changes in fair value or cash flows  are expected to completely offset. Execution and management  of all derivative transactions are conducted pursuant to the  internal management rule. The estimated fair values of the derivative financial  instruments as of March 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: 1.

Thousands of U.S. dollars Millions of yen Segment Information General information about reportable segments A reportable segment is a component or an aggregated component of Tokyo Electron. For each of the components, discrete  financial information is available and the operating result is regularly reviewed by management to make decisions about resources to be  allocated to the segment and assess its performance. The operation of Tokyo Electron consists of segments by products and services based on business units (BUs), and Tokyo Electron  identifies as a reportable segment, “semiconductor production equipment (SPE)” and “flat panel display (FPD) production equipment”. Products of the SPE segment consist of coater/developers, etch systems, deposition systems, cleaning systems used in wafer  processing, wafer probers used in the wafer testing process and other semiconductor production equipment, such as wafer bonders/ debonders. The SPE segment principally develops, manufactures, and sells such products, and provides services on them. Products of the FPD production equipment segment consist of coater/developers, etch/ash systems used in the manufacture of  flat panel displays and inkjet printing systems used in the manufacture of OLED displays. The FPD production equipment segment  principally develops, manufactures, and sells such products, and provides services on them. Basis of measurement of reportable segment net sales, segment profit (loss), segment assets and other items The accounting policies applied in each reportable segment are generally consistent with those applied for the preparation of the  consolidated financial statements. Intersegment sales or transfers are determined by negotiation between the Tokyo Electron group  companies considering current market prices. Assets in common use have not been allocated to each reportable segment, while costs  associated with those assets have been allocated to reportable segments on a systematic basis. 2.

Millions of yen Thousands of U.S.  dollars Thousands of U.S. dollars Millions of yen (1) Market changes The semiconductor market is expected to further grow in  the medium to long term due to continuing technological  innovation amid an accelerating transition to a data-driven  society backed by the spread of information and communication  technology applications such as IoT, AI and 5G; progress in  digital transformation (DX); and response to sustainability  transformation (SX). However, a wide range of factors— including the global economy, demand for end products, trade  and tariff policies, and geopolitical factors—can cause short- term supply and demand to become unbalanced and generate  significant fluctuations in market size. Rapid contraction  of the semiconductor market could lead to results such as  overproduction, increases in dead inventory or losses from bad  debts resulting from the worsening of a customer’s financial  position. On the other hand, a rapid increase in demand that we  cannot respond to could lead to situations such as an inability  to provide products to customers in a timely manner resulting  in lost opportunities. Both of these circumstances can adversely  affect our business performance. To respond to such market fluctuations, we constantly  work to appropriately adjust our capital investment, personnel,  inventory plans and other aspects of our businesses based  on understanding of the latest market conditions through  periodically reviewing the market environment and orders  received at Board of Directors and other important meetings.  In addition, a large portion of our sales are to major, leading- edge semiconductor manufacturers. As such, our performance  tends to be impacted by changes in capital investment by these  major customers.  We have established an Account Sales Division, which works  in close coordination with major customers and quickly grasps  trends in their capital investment outlook, as well as a Global  Sales Division, which responds to a wide range of customer  needs from around the world and cultivates new customers  emerging in step with growth in semiconductor demand.  Through such efforts, we strive to strengthen and expand our  sales framework and customer base.) (2) Geopolitics We undertake businesses in various countries and regions, and  a high proportion of sales comes from overseas. Amid growing  international attention on semiconductors, countries and  regions are seen to be embarking on measures—including  the domestication of semiconductor-related businesses,  prioritization of domestically manufactured products,  tightening of export controls and strengthened environmental  regulations—from perspectives such as industrial policy,  national security and environmental policy. Our business  performance may therefore be affected if our business activities  are restricted as a result of those measures. The following are recognized as the main risks that may have a  critical impact on Tokyo Electron’s financial condition, operating  results or cash flow. This is not a comprehensive list of all risks  pertaining to us and there are also risks which are not listed. We grasp the implementation moves of regulations regarding  import and export of products and technological development  by carefully watching policy and diplomatic trends of countries,  anticipating the impacts when policies and regulations are  introduced and considering countermeasures. At the same time,  in addition to the early identification of risks, we also strive to  take fast and appropriate response when risks occur, including  communicating our opinions to the policy-making authorities  through means such as public comments for the healthy  development of the semiconductor industry. (3) Research and Development Through ongoing R&D investment in leading-edge technologies,  we quickly bring to market new products incorporating such  technologies, succeeding in capturing high market share in each  product category and achieving a high profit margin. However,  delays in the launch of new products that meet customers’  technological needs, the mismatch of newly developed products  with such needs, or the launch of new technologies or products  by competitors before our launches could negatively affect the  competitiveness of our products, impede the recovery of R&D  costs or otherwise affect our business performance. We have established a Corporate Innovation Division, which  develops innovative technology and makes groundbreaking  technology proposals that integrate the products and  technologies of each development division as part of a Group- wide development framework. In addition, we have in place  a system that constantly provides highly competitive Next- generation products that meet future needs ahead of our  competitors through initiatives such as conducting joint research  with global research institutions and sharing technology  roadmaps spanning multiple technology generations with  leading-edge customers. (4) Procurement, Production and Supply Our key production sites are located in Japan, and we  supply products to customers in and outside Japan. As such,  earthquakes, floods or other natural disasters, acts of terrorism,  unavoidable events like infectious disease outbreaks or other  such accidents occurring in Japan could cause interruptions in  production that, if not promptly resolved, could delay the supply  of products to customers. Furthermore, the stable supply of  components and such provided by suppliers is indispensable  to stable production. Therefore, in addition to the risk of  disasters, accidents or other similar events, delays in component  procurement due to the worsening of a supplier’s business  conditions, demand that exceeds supply capabilities arising from  the expansion of the semiconductor market or similar factors  could result in delays in the supply of products to customers and  affect our business performance. We formulate and periodically review business continuity  plans (BCPs) and undertakes measures such as establishing  alternate production capabilities, developing multiple sources  of important parts, seismically reinforcing its plants, and  maintaining backups of information systems. In addition, we  also seek to procure components early and level production by sharing forecasts with suppliers that consider our  customers’ investment plans as well as semiconductor demand  projections. Through these and other measures, we strive to  maintain stable product supply. (5) Safety Our business performance may be affected if problems related  to the safety of our products occur, including damage to  customers, order cancellations, liability for damages or decline in  our credibility. Our “Safety First” approach entails the constant consideration  of safety and health in the execution of business activities,  including development, manufacturing, sales, services and  management. In accordance with this approach, we work  continuously to improve the safety of our products. Measures  to this end include thoroughgoing safety design at the  product development phase, promotion of safety training and  maintaining an accident reporting system. (6) Quality Our products are based on the integration of numerous  leading-edge technologies. The occurrence of defects  could lead to recalls, liability for damages based on quality  responsibility, additional costs related to implementing defect  countermeasures, decline in our credibility, or otherwise affect  our business performance. Based on a uniform Group-wide quality control policy,  we provide quality training for our employees and suppliers  and strive to constantly maintain a quality assurance system,  including ISO 9001 certification, as well as a world-class  service system. In development, we introduce collaboration  with sales and service departments from the initial stages  of product development and design to solve technological  issues. Furthermore, we mitigate and address risks such as by  using simulation technology for thorough validation. When  defects occur, we investigate the root of the problem and  take thoroughgoing measures to prevent recurrences and  the occurrence of similar defects. Similarly, in managing the  quality of procured components, we constantly monitor the  state of supplier quality and conduct audits, improvement  support and other measures. (7) Laws and Regulations We operate globally and are therefore subject to the various  laws and regulations of the countries and regions where we do  business, including those regarding imports and exports, the  environment, competition, labor, corruption, bribery and transfer  pricing taxation. We strive to ensure compliance with such laws  and regulations. However, violations of such laws or regulations  could result in consequences such as diminished public confidence  in us, fines, liability for damages or restrictions on business  activities. Furthermore, national security policies of countries  and unanticipated future legal amendments or tightening of  regulations could, if not appropriately responded to, result in  liability for costs related to such response or restrictions on  business activities, or otherwise affect our business performance. We have built a system for monitoring compliance activities  at each of the key sites in and outside Japan under the direction  of a Chief Compliance Officer. We conduct compliance  assessments by external experts, report the identified issues  to the CEO, Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board,  and carry out swift and effective measures as well as further  enhancement of systems. (8) Intellectual Property Rights Our products are based on the integration of numerous  leading-edge technologies. Obtaining and legally protecting our  intellectual property rights and preventing infringements of such  rights by third parties are crucial to differentiating and reinforcing  the competitiveness of our products. Infringements by us of  the intellectual property rights of third parties could lead to  restrictions on the production and sale of our products or liability  for damages, or otherwise affect our business performance. By advancing R&D strategy, business strategy and intellectual  property strategy in an integrated manner, we strive to build an  appropriate intellectual property portfolio and obtain exclusive  rights to numerous proprietary technologies to capture high market  share and achieve high profit margins in each of our product fields. (9) Information Security In the course of its business activities, we may obtain, hold and  utilize confidential information, customer information and personal  information. Incidents—such as the breach of information and  service disruption—caused by unauthorized access or operation  due to cyberattacks and other causes, human errors, natural  disasters or other reasons could result in diminished public  confidence in us, liability for damages or other consequences which  may otherwise affect our business performance. Together with seeking organizational reinforcement  such as by creating a dedicated department centered on the  Information Security Committee, we are building an information  security system based on global standards, by conducting  security assessments by external experts. In addition, beside  technological aspects such as the introduction of an anomaly  detection system in preparation for the occurrence of incidents,  we are also taking measures from operational aspects, such  as establishing globally standardized rules and regulations for  information management and guidelines for response during the  occurrence of incidents. (10) Human Resources Securing and developing diverse human resources in and  outside Japan and the practice of diversity and inclusion are  crucial to the continued innovation and growth of our global  businesses. The inability to recruit and retain the necessary  human resources on an ongoing basis or the inability to create  an environment where human resources with diverse values and  expertise can apply their individualities can lead to diminished  product development capability or customer support quality.  This may result in not being able to realize an organization with  competitive advantage or other such consequences that may  affect our business performance. We believe that our employees are the source of ongoing  value creation and that increasing employee engagement is  one of the most important factors in increasing corporate  value. Specifically, we undertake measures such as the sharing  of direction by top management through regular employee  meetings, the building of plans to continuously develop next- generation human resources, the visualization of employee  career paths, and the provision of attractive remuneration  and benefits. We are also advancing ongoing measures to  improve work environments as well as health and productivity  management, including steps to prevent excessively long work  hours and workplace harassment. (11) Environmental Issues Globally, there are growing requests from society, including  our stakeholders, related to sustainability. Given this,  difficulties in adequately responding to requirements  accompanying the transition to a carbon-free society— including the climate change policies and environmental laws  and regulations of countries, industry standards of conduct,  technological innovation and customer needs—could  result in costs for additional responses such as new product  development, specification change and modifications,  reduced product competitiveness, diminished public  confidence in us or other consequences that may otherwise  affect our business performance. Together with striving to comply with environmental laws  and regulations and industry standards of conduct, we set our  own industry-leading medium- to long-term environmental  goals and work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from  the use of our products. We also seek to increase the ratio of  renewable energy usage and reduce energy consumption at our  plants and offices. In addition, we work to protect the global  environment through our business activities by such means  as providing technologies to reduce semiconductor power  consumption, promoting used equipment and parts businesses,  reducing equipment size, increasing productivity by improving  throughput, reviewing packaging and promoting modal shifts. (12) The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) The spread of COVID-19 could affect our business continuity,  including our manufacturing and sales activities. In addition,  restrictions on the worldwide movement of people and things,  the deterioration of global economic conditions, and other  such impacts from the spread of COVID-19 could affect our  business performance.  Centered on the Emergency Task Force headed by the CEO,  we are implementing related countermeasures, including  restricting travel to high infection-risk countries and regions,  taking steps to maintain supply chains, and thorough infection  prevention measures at our plants and offices. (13) Other Risks Our businesses are influenced by many factors, including the  global and regional political conditions, economic conditions,  financial and stock markets, commodity and real estate  markets, foreign exchange rates, the success or failure of  corporate acquisitions, major lawsuits, and competition over  standardization. We expect that such factors will sometimes  affect our business performance and take the necessary  measures to counter such risks. We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Tokyo Electron Limited (“the Company”) and its  consolidated subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “the Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as at March  31, 2021 and 2020, the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in net assets and cash flows for the  years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated  financial position of the Group as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated  cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan. Our responsibilities under those  standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements  section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our  audit of the consolidated financial statements in Japan, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance  with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the  consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion  on these matters. In the consolidated balance sheet for the current fiscal year,  the Company recognized Inventories of ¥415,344 million, which  represented approximately 29% of total assets in the consolidated  financial statements. Most of the inventories belonged to the  semiconductor production equipment business. As described in Note 3 “Significant Accounting Estimates, 1.  Valuation of inventories” to the consolidated financial statements,  inventories are measured in principle at the lower of either the  acquisition cost or the net selling price at the end of the fiscal  year. However, inventories aged over a certain holding period  are classified based on the use and salability and are then  systematically written down according to their classification. In  addition, the carrying amount of inventories to be disposed of is  written down to the estimated disposal value. The valuation of inventories aged over a certain holding period  and the identification of finished goods and work in process  inventories to be disposed of are based on management’s  forecasts of future demand and prospects of market environment.  Among the markets in which the Group participate, the  semiconductor market is susceptible to significant fluctuations  due to a short-term imbalance between supply and demand,  which could result in an unforeseen rapid market contraction.  Therefore, the forecasts of future demand and prospects of  market environment involve uncertainty and management’s  judgment thereon may have a significant effect on the  valuation of inventories. We, therefore, determined that our assessment of the  reasonableness of the Company’s valuation of inventories in  the semiconductor production equipment business was one of  the most significant in our audit of the consolidated financial  statements for the current fiscal year, and accordingly,   a key audit matter. The primary procedures we performed to assess whether  the Company’s valuation of inventories in the semiconductor  production equipment business was reasonable included  the following: (1) Internal control testing We tested the design and operating effectiveness of certain  of the Company’s internal controls relevant to the valuation  of inventories. In this assessment, we focused our testing on controls designed to  determine the rates of write-down for each holding period on the  carrying amount of inventories aged over a certain holding period  and to identify finished goods and work in process inventories to  be disposed of in a comprehensive manner. (2)  Assessment of whether the valuation of inventories aged  over a certain holding period was reasonable The rates of write-down by holding period adopted by  management in applying the method that writes down the  carrying amount of inventories on a systematic basis according to  their holding periods were determined based on management’s  forecasts of future demand and prospects of market environment.  In order to assess the reasonableness of assumptions underlying  the rates of write-down determined by management, we: •  evaluated the rates of write-down by holding period determined  by management by referencing published demand forecasts for  semiconductor production equipment and the customers’ capital  investment plans; and •  compared the amount of the write-down of inventories aged  over a certain holding period, calculated using the rates of write- down by holding period determined by management, with our  own estimate of the write-down of those inventories. (3)  Assessment of whether finished goods and work in  process inventories to be disposed of were identified in a  comprehensive manner Among finished goods and work in process inventories aged over a  certain holding period, we assessed the accuracy of management’s  sales forecasts by comparing the past forecast for a selection of  finished goods and work in process inventories held for a long  period with actual sales results and examining the causes of  variances between the two. In order to assess the reasonableness  of assumptions related to sales forecasts adopted by management  in identifying finished goods and work in process inventories to be  disposed of, we primarily: •  evaluated the basis for management judgment on its sales  forecasts for finished goods and work in process inventories held  for a long period by inquiring of management and inspecting  relevant documents. Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with  accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable  the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as  a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern in accordance with accounting principles generally  accepted in Japan. Corporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors are responsible for overseeing the directors’ performance of their duties  with regard to the design, implementation and maintenance of the Group’s financial reporting process. Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable  assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted in Japan will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud  or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and  maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: •  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design  and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as  fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. •  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. •  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related  disclosures made by management. •  Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit  evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on  the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw  attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are  inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s  report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. •  Evaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in accordance with accounting  standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,  including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events  in a manner that achieves fair presentation. •  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the  Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and  performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with corporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned  scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify  during our audit. We also provide corporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors with a statement that we have complied with relevant  ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with corporate auditors and the board of corporate auditors, we determine those matters that  were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit  matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter  or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the  adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. The U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year ended March 31, 2021  are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our  opinion, such translation has been made on the basis described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. We do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the Certified Public  Accountants Act of Japan.

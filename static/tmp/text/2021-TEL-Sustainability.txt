In addition, there  were geopolitical issues such as trade friction as well as various human rights issues that occurred worldwide.   It became a year carved in history as one that had a major impact on society and the lives of people. On the other hand, it was also a year when digital transformation (DX) made progress in our daily lives and all  kinds of industries, and the importance of semiconductors, which are essential for information and  communication technology (ICT), became prominent. Applications expanded for the displays that link people  and data, and additional advances in technological innovation were made. As a result of the spread of the IoT, AI, 5G and other technologies, we are transitioning to a data society at an  unprecedented pace. As efforts to solve global environmental problems progress, the balancing of “digital and  green” is now a major trend around the world. Under the circumstances, Tokyo Electron seeks to leverage our expertise developed as a globally leading  company and as a manufacturer of semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment and use all of  our management resources, including the employees who are the source of value creation, in order to  contribute to the realization of the social issue of the compatibility of digitalization and greening as well as a  shared value. We strive to practice our Corporate Philosophy, ”We strive to contribute to the development of a  dream-inspiring society through our leading-edge technologies and reliable service and support” while  increasing medium- to long-term profit expansion and continuous corporate value enhancement. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all stakeholders for your continued support and patronage. Our pursuit of sustainability is the practice of our Corporate Philosophy, and we undertake a diverse range of  company-wide measures through our business. As the social importance of semiconductors and displays increases, the key issues that we need to strengthen  (i.e., material issues) based on a strong management foundation of safety, quality, compliance, governance and  risk management underpinning our business activities are product competitiveness (being the first to identify  leading-edge technological trends and changing needs), continuously creating next-generation products with  the overwhelming added value and performance that future customers will require, and being the sole  strategic partner based on our extensive track record and customer responsiveness, as well as higher  productivity based on the continual improvement of operational efficiency. As a result of these efforts, we will  further reinforce earnings power. To address environmental issues, our technologies contribute to enhancing the performance and reducing the  power consumption of semiconductor devices and displays, and in December 2020, we revised our medium- term environmental goals for fiscal year 2031. Our goals are to reduce CO2 emissions per wafer by 30%  compared with fiscal year 2019 and to reduce total CO2 emissions from plants and offices by 70% compared  with fiscal year 2019 by using 100% renewable energy and implementing other measures. In addition to these  industry-leading goals, we launched E-COMPASS (Environmental Co-Creation by Material, Process and  Subcomponent Solutions) as a new initiative in June of this year. We believe that continuously implementing  global environmental preservation measures throughout the entire supply chain will strengthen product  competitiveness and lead to the provision of added value to customers. Through these measures, we will  perform our social roles for achieving decarbonization. To promote the sustainability management expected of us by global society, we signed the United Nations  Global Compact and joined the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA). Through these international initiatives, we  are actively addressing environmental issues and human rights issues as well. Regarding corporate governance that underpins our business activities, we strive to create highly effective  structure that can achieve sustainable growth while considering our corporate culture and the unique  characteristics of our business so that we can adequately perform management decision-making and  supervisory functions. Moving forward, to properly fulfill our mission and responsibilities, we will aim to remain a truly excellent global  company that is loved and highly trusted by all stakeholders by promoting sustainability-focused management  and contributing to addressing issues of industry and society as well as their development. Your continued support and patronage are very much appreciated by all of us at Tokyo Electron. CSR Policy The CSR operations of Tokyo Electron are initiatives that realize our Corporate Philosophy. We pursue sustainable  operations from the viewpoints of corporate governance, legal and regulatory compliance and business ethics while  creating new value through our products and services. Based on these efforts, we implement CSR activities to help  address social issues. We will continue to pursue CSR activities to build stakeholder trust, improve corporate value and,  by doing so, promote the growth of a sustainable and dream-inspiring society. CSR Promotion Framework We implement sustainability management, integrating it with our business strategy from a medium- to long-term  perspective of corporate value enhancement. Three groups have been established to promote CSR activities. The CSR Management Council, the highest decision-making body regarding CSR, conducts discussions on the policy  for the entire company, and important projects. Based on this, the CSR Global Committee discusses CSR target setting  and progress management regarding activities for achieving CSR targets, along with promoting global projects, and  shares best practices. At the CSR Monthly Meeting, information on CSR activities is shared with representatives from  each division, and collaborative systems are built to tackle cross-division themes. We are also working to further strengthen our CSR structure by appointing CSR managers at the company  headquarters as well as the Group companies in Japan and overseas companies to be in charge of understanding CSR  policy and goals and promoting activities. In addition to these groups, once a year we invite all employees to submit  examples of CSR in the workplace, toward issue resolution and  advancement of industry and society, and practice of our Corporate  Philosophy. Outstanding initiatives are awarded the CSR Promotion Award  by the Representative Director, President & CEO. We strive to contribute to the development of a  dream-inspiring society through our leading-edge  technologies and reliable service and support. Participation in Global Initiatives We signed onto the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC1) and support its Ten Principles in the four areas of Human  Rights, Labour, Environment, and Anti-Corruption, to realize sound globalization and a sustainable society. Additionally, as a corporate member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA2), we promote sustainability in our  supply chain by abiding by the RBA Code of Conduct comprised of five framework sections (Labor, Environment,  Health and Safety, Ethics and Management Systems). In addition, we have expressed our approval of the recommendations offered by the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD3) and are pursuing initiatives based on the framework of governance, strategy, risk  management, indicators and targets relating to the risks and opportunities that climate change presents to our  business. Initiatives for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) The SDGs are a universal set of goals to achieve by 2030, which were  unanimously adopted by the United Nations Sustainable Development  Summit in 2015. We conduct activities on a company-wide basis, and for each  CSR fiscal year and medium-term goal, and each material issue, we clarified  the SDGs it is working toward through business. Additionally, starting in fiscal year 2021, we have been on a regular basis  holding SDGs workshops where employees working in a variety of fields come  together and discuss various suggestions for contributing to the achievement  of SDGs through business. Evaluation from Third-Party Institutions Our CSR activities have received high appraisals from evaluation organizations around the world. We have continued to be  selected as a constituent stock under leading global ESG investment indices, including the DJSI4 Asia Pacific Index,  FTSE4Good Index5 and MSCI World ESG Leaders Indexes6, and in 2021, we were also rated as a low-risk company in  Sustainalytics’ ESG Risk Ratings7. Financial Model in the Medium-Term Management Plan In addition to pursuing sustainable operations in line with its CSR policy, we are also striving for medium- to long-term  profits and ongoing corporate value enhancement by creating new value through business and helping in the  resolution of issues and development of industry and society. In May 2019, against a backdrop of market growth for  semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment, we formulated the Medium-term Management Plan and  set goals in the associated financial model of net sales of 2 trillion yen, an operating margin of 30% or higher and ROE9  of at least 30% by March 2024. We have also set two goals for generating and returning appropriate profits to  shareholders in the event of changes in the macro-economy or in the semiconductor supply-demand balance.

Social Issues While society is currently being affected in many ways by the COVID-19 pandemic, humans are also faced with various  issues, such as abnormal climate conditions and natural disasters, human rights issues, conflicts between nations and  cyber-attacks. Mitigating climate change and eliminating inequality in human rights in particular are pressing issues for  the global community, and there are strong calls for further action, not just by international organizations, and  national governments, but also by the private sector. While participating in global initiatives such as the United Nations Global Compact and RBA and keeping an eye on  societal trends, and considering recommendations from third party organizations, we also examine social issues that  may impact our business activities. Business Environment With the spread of IoT, AI, 5G and other technologies, a data-centric age has arrived and the implementation of digital  transformation and information and communication technology (ICT) is accelerating. This further increases the  importance of the semiconductor industry as a social infrastructure. Along with innovations in semiconductor  technologies to achieve larger capacity, higher speed, higher reliability and lower power consumption, the market for  semiconductor wafer fab equipment (WFE*), in which we conduct our business, is forecast to continue expanding. New evolutions are also required in Flat Panel Display (FPDs), which act as the interface between people and ICT,  and further technical innovations are occurring. In the future, as organic EL displays become widespread, panel size  increases, and design improvements that take advantage of enhanced characteristics such as high resolution, low  power consumption, thinner profile and flexibility, are expected to further expand the application fields. Taking actions to preserve the global environment has become an urgent issue, and initiatives toward  decarbonization are accelerating on a global scale under international frameworks such as the SDGs and Paris  Agreement. As the transition to a digital and green society progresses, the roles played by semiconductors and FPDs  will increase even further in the future.  At the same time, the importance of corporate governance, which fundamentally supports the medium- to long- term growth of corporations, is also increasing. Further strengthening of measures is essential to ensure safety and  quality, as well as compliance and risk management. Risks and Opportunities We examined the risks and opportunities closely related to sustainable business development in consideration of social  issues and social/business environments such as the SDGs.  If we fail to comply with laws and regulations, industry codes of  conduct, or in-house policy, product competitiveness and social  credibility will decline, and the cost of correcting the problem will  increase business costs.  If we fail to comply with laws and regulations, industry codes  of conduct, or in-house policy, social credibility and employee  engagement will decline.  If a natural disaster occurs, or it becomes impossible to continue  business transactions with suppliers, events such as delivery delays  and contractual non-performance will harm business continuity.  If sustainability-related issues such as the environment and human  rights become more serious, operations will stagnate.   If management’s monitoring or supervising function declines,  management risk will increase, and business activities will stagnate.  If an ethical or compliance violation occurs, we will lose social  credibility and suffer economic loss.  If the development of leading-edge technologies is delayed, we will  lose business opportunities.  If confidential information is leaked, social credibility will decline, and  compensation for damages be required.  If a cyber-attack or natural disaster occurs, our business will stagnate. * WFE: Wafer Fab  Equipment. The  semiconductor  production process is  divided into front-end  production, in which  circuits are formed on  wafers and inspected,  and back-end  production, in which  wafers are cut into  chips, assembled and  inspected again. WFE  refers to the production  equipment used in  front-end production  and in wafer-level  packaging production. Stakeholder Engagement We examined the opinions and requests obtained through dialogue and engagement opportunities with stakeholders. Identifying Material Issues We have ascertained the social issues and business environment, considered the risks and opportunities and  examined the opinions and requests of all stakeholders. We have reassessed material issues from the perspectives  of developing a sustainable society and enhancing medium- to long-term corporate value. As a result, we decided to leave Product Competitiveness, Customer Responsiveness, and Higher Productivity  unchanged, which are items already identified for enhancement in the Medium-term Management Plan as material  issues. We also reexamined the significance and activities related to People and Workplaces, which had previously  been defined as a material issue through fiscal year 2021, and decided to integrate it into Management Foundation. The material issues were decided at the CSR Management Council, attended by Chairman of the Board,  Representative Director, and President & CEO, and corporate directors involved in CSR. Annual Goals for Each Material Issue Reflecting on the priority themes in each material issue, we verified the results against the goals for fiscal year 2021  and set annual goals for fiscal year 2022. In setting each goal, we have clearly identified the corporate director  responsible for achieving it, and we are working on various activities aimed at further enhancing our corporate value  and contributing to the achievement of SDGs.  Create work environment in which diverse human resources can thrive  Coexistence of the company with communities  Promotion of environment conservation  Human resource development and innovation  Create new values through innovation  Initiatives targeted at climate change, human rights, etc.  Building of sounder supply chains Work-life balance  Reach at least 70% take-up rate of annual paid leave  62.5% (Japan)  Double the percentage of female managers and experts (with same  roles and responsibilities as managers) by fiscal year 2022 from 2.0%5  in fiscal year 2019  Reduce gap between health age6 and actual age by 1.5 points by fiscal  year 2021 (as compared with fiscal year 2018)  Reduce the number of workplace injuries per 200,000 work hours.

We also continuously strive to reduce the  environmental impact of our equipment. By providing technology that contributes to the development of devices with even  lower power consumption, we endeavor to preserve the global environment. We contribute to the development of industry  and society through innovative technologies and environmental initiatives. Development System In the ever-diversifying area of semiconductor production technology, we have built a system to bring high-value- added products into the market in a timely fashion, promoting technology development and technology innovation  for the next generations with collaboration between our Development & Production Group and Business Group. We  share technology roadmaps spanning multiple generations for the future with our customers, and work with relevant  divisions across the company in converting that technology to equipment in anticipation of their needs.  Specifically, the Corporate Innovation Division, which is headed by the Representative Director, President & CEO,  along with the development divisions of the manufacturing sites in Japan and the marketing departments of business  units, are leading efforts to enhance process integration capabilities based on our wide lineup of semiconductor  production equipment and to promote and develop digital transformation1 using AI technology. In January 2020, we  established TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America to optimize development and manufacturing functions  and improve operational efficiency not only in Japan but in the U.S. as well. Since then, the company has been pushing  ahead with activities. Furthermore, with regard to environment, health and safety (EHS), which is becoming increasingly important as  societal demands escalate, the EHS Council, which oversees our entire company, is playing a pivotal role in promoting  the review and formulation of basic policies. Each of our manufacturing sites in Japan are also actively working to  create a development system that is mindful of the environment, health and safety. Research and Development for the Future Digital technology is becoming an increasingly familiar part of people’s lives, such as online education and medical  services, remote work, and the emergence of various services utilizing AI. The evolution of IT applications and the  diversification of services are expected to continue. As a support for the evolution of such digital technology,  semiconductors will become increasingly necessary in the future, and more advanced and diversified technologies  will be required for semiconductor manufacturing. At Tokyo Electron, we discuss the role we should play for the  future on a daily basis, and are working company-wide on research and development with an eye on future  technology markets. 1  Digital transformation:  Refer to p. 19 Shift Left We are focused on advancing the Shift Left approach, investing resources (including technology, personnel and money) into the  early processes of product development. Together with customers who conduct research with a vision beyond even the next  generation and who aim to accelerate the speed of development further, we have created a technology road map, and are  engaged in developing the various technologies required for its realization. In fiscal year 2021, responding to the ongoing customer need for production equipment to take up less space, we succeeded in  improving equipment efficiency per unit area by maximizing the use of clean rooms and providing more productive equipment.  We also established new goals and strengthened our efforts to meet the environmental demands of customers for equipment. Through promoting the Shift Left approach, we are endeavoring to understand customer needs at an earlier stage and to  strengthen feedback from front-line service engineers, and by reflecting the information obtained through this in the development  of technology, we can propose superior products that contribute to maximizing yield for customer devices and capacity utilization  of their mass production line equipment. We also promote on-site collaboration for early delivery of evaluation units at customers’  plants and research and development laboratories, shortening the period between technology development and the conversion to  mass production equipment and maximizing efficiency. Product Marketing We are promoting effective product development by having our sales departments and product marketing departments  appropriately play their respective roles. Our sales departments are responsible for building relationships of trust with customers  and ensuring that products and services are provided through business to the customers they serve. Meanwhile, our product  marketing departments plan and manage product strategies that meet the future needs of customers in target markets, such as  development planning to increase the value of customer products, services and the examination of value-adding mechanisms.  They also consider the commercialization of technology and the addition of functions based on the seeds of our development  divisions, and formulate strategies for collaborating with partner companies and consortiums. Our sales departments and product marketing departments work together in developing product marketing activities that  contribute to customers’ products by anticipating market needs, and in doing so, help improve our product competitiveness and  promote our Shift Left approach. Collaboration with Consortiums and Academia  We are enhancing our own research and development capabilities through collaboration with international and  domestic consortiums which allows us to further our development of leading-edge technologies. Specifically, we are  focusing on collaboration in a wide range of areas, from development to market launch of rapidly evolving  technologies and applications. This is achieved through participation in a global research hub developing next- generation AI hardware, by cooperating with BRIDG2, a not-for-profit, public-private partnership located in the U.S.  state of Florida, by strengthening collaboration in the field of EUV3 at imec and by accelerating our research in the  front-end and back-end fields4 at TTCA5. We are also working on various collaborations with academia, including major universities in Japan. In particular, we  are promoting collaboration in a wide range of fields with the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and 2 BRIDG: BRIDG is a  not-for-profit,  public-private  partnership specializing  in advanced system  integration,  microelectronics  fabrication, III-V  materials deposition for  sensors, optoelectronics  and high-speed  transistors. BRIDG  offers production  process technologies,  research and  development  capabilities and 200  mm microelectronics  fabrication geared  toward system  miniaturization, device  integration, hardware  security and product  development key to  aerospace/defense and  the IoT/AI revolution.   Supported by Osceola  County, University of  Central Florida, Florida  High Tech Corridor  Council and others,  BRIDG provides the  physical foundry  infrastructure and  collaborative process to  connect challenges and  opportunities with  solutions; “Bridging the  Innovation  Development Gap”  making  commercialization  possible. 3 EUV: Extreme  Ultraviolet. Refers to  ultraviolet radiation  (ultraviolet rays) in the  wavelength range  1–100 nm. 4 Front-end/Back-end  fields: In the fabrication  of semiconductor  devices, the first half of  the upstream process is  called “front-end-of- line” (FEOL) processing  (substrate) and the  second half is called  “back-end-of-line”  (BEOL) processing  (wiring). 5 TTCA: TEL Technology  Center, America, LLC.  Our research and  development center in  the U.S. Technology (AIST)—one of Japan’s largest public research institutions—including the MRAM1-related research that we  have been working on for some time. In the field of semiconductor development, which is becoming increasingly  diverse, we will further strengthen our own research and development by leveraging AIST’s world-leading research  environment and world-class research staff. Initiatives in Japan Since 2018, we have been conducting a joint research selection program with universities with the aim of discovering  and collaborating on advanced element technologies in relation to semiconductors. Over the past three years, 16  topics have been chosen for joint research. Although applicants are free to propose any research topics, we adopt  those proposals that match our technological abilities needs and which are expected to help develop our technological  and planning capabilities and contribute to the future development of our business areas through the creative  perspectives and ideas only possible in academia. Technical advisors selected from our development divisions and business units (BUs) are in charge of selecting  topics, with subsequent joint research activities managed by a secretariat. Technical advisors strive to generate  research results by promoting technical assessment with the university, and at the end of the research period, where  outcomes are found to be effective, the topics are considered by our BUs for ongoing research. In addition to promoting the development of a wide range of semiconductor-related technology and devices, we  are promoting the selection program in an effort to contribute to the evolution of science and technology and the  revitalization of research activities at universities. Intellectual Property Management Our fundamental tenet for intellectual property (IP) is to protect our  intellectual assets and contribute to increasing corporate revenue through  the support of our business activity. In our uniquely evolving industry, we have increased the global  investment in research and development, including industry-academia  collaborative initiatives that synergistically grow our business. We establish regional IP offices, as well as corporate  headquarters, to locate IP personnel at research, development, and production sites worldwide. Those IP personnel  assess each project from various angles, including R&D and marketing perspectives, building IP portfolios aligned with  technology, and product strategies in an effort to boost competitiveness. We sustained our worldwide advantage in the IP strength again in calendar year 2020. 1,180 inventions were created in  Japan, and 120 were created in other countries. We have maintained a global patent application rate2 of approximately  70% for the tenth consecutive year and achieved high patent approval rates (85% in Japan and 87% in the United States).  The number of joint patent applications in collaboration with partner companies, universities and other research  institutes around the world has reached 25, with 13 companies and 8 organizations in the last two years. To increase IP awareness, we have continuously educated our engineers, who are the foundation of our R&D  strategy, and in total, around 4,370 engineers have become inventors. Additionally, because we often handle highly  confidential information, including technological information of our customers and collaborative partners, we have  also focused on confidential information management education. Research and Development for Next-Generation Computing Global demand for semiconductors has been increasing in recent years, and the production volume of semiconductors  is expected to continue increasing. Under such circumstances, reducing the power consumption of semiconductors  has become a major issue. We recognize this issue as an energy supply risk in the market, and are working for a  solution.  Modern computing is not necessarily optimized for power efficiency. The mainstream solution to this problem these  days is to optimize the architecture, placing memory devices closer to logic devices (arithmetic circuits), resulting in a  considerable reduction in power consumption. One of the technologies that make this “optimization of architecture”  possible is 3D system integration. Also called “heterogeneous integration1”, 3D system integration technology is one  that combines and packages different materials such as silicon and non-silicon elements, CPUs2 and DRAMs3. Specific  combinations applying this technology are expected to reduce power consumption to between 1/100th and 1/1000th  of conventional architecture.  Furthermore, the development of resistive analog neuro devices4 and nonvolatile resistive random access memory5  that simulate the human brain is essential to the evolution of AI technology, and our film deposition technology is  contributing to this.  Realizing next-generation computing requires the development of AI chipsets with even faster processing and  greater energy efficiency. By taking maximum advantage of a wide range of technologies and various techniques, we  are working to create high-value-added products that meet the next-generation need of bringing computers closer to  the human brain. To this end, we are expanding further the technological areas in which we can contribute, such as  developing new materials and boosting the performance of chipsets through 3D system integration, and we are rolling  out initiatives aimed at optimizing the power efficiency of semiconductors and realizing next-generation computing. Promoting Digital Transformation (DX) DX promotion, which is making waves across the global industrial world, is also becoming more prominent in the  semiconductor and flat panel display (FPD) production equipment industries. Having positioned DX as an important part  of the solution to the demand for further miniaturization and multi-layering, in January 2021, we formulated the TEL DX  Vision of “a global company where all employees drive enterprise value creation sustainably through activities such as  value addition and efficiency improvements by leveraging digital technology”. The two key objectives of this are to  contribute to customers’ value creation in a range of settings from development to mass production and to raise capital  efficiency in a range of settings from the product planning stage to maintenance. We will achieve these two objectives by  resolving high-level problems via a cycle of monitoring, analysis and prediction, control and autonomy. We are also proceeding with the practical application of TELeMetrics™, which remotely connects our company with  our customers’ manufacturing site, thereby enabling remote maintenance, as well as remote support for equipment  using AR7 smart glasses and material searches utilizing AI. 1 Heterogeneous  Integration: Packaging  that unites different  kinds of chips  2 CPU: Central Processing  Unit. A semiconductor  chip that serves as the  brain of a computer. 3 DRAM: Dynamic  Random Access  Memory. A type of  semiconductor memory  used in the main  storage unit of a  computer or as a  large-capacity working  memory of other  electronic devices. 7 AR: Augmented Reality.  Wearing smart glasses  to link with the real  world and obtain an  augmented reality  output based on  information about  objects in the real world. Furthermore, we are also systematically recruiting and training  human resources to utilize data science1 in our business. In November  2020, we relocated our Sapporo office, a software development site,  and established TEL Digital Design Square as our home base for DX  activities. In addition to installing leading-edge facilities and adopting a  hot-desking system to develop software technology, we will put effort  into recruiting and training data scientists, data analysts and other  human resources necessary for DX to utilize data science in our  business. Based on the belief that utilizing digital technology can contribute to  everything from accelerating the speed of development, improving  productivity and quality and enhancing business efficiency to  reforming workstyles, we are working on greater DX promotion. ■	Example Initiative In the adjustment of film stress2 (target value: -100 to 0 MPa)  using plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE-ALD3), we  used AI-based machine learning to consolidate and analyze past  test data and optimize the process in order to overcome the  inability of the previous method to achieve film stress  requirements using engineers. As a result, we were able to not only  resolve this issue but also contribute to reducing wafer  consumption. By making use of AI as a member of the team  without being bound to conventional thinking and practices,  engineers will be able to perform work with high added value. Support for Evolving Displays  With the evolution of communications technology such as IoT and 5G,  further performance improvements are also expected for displays that  project all kinds of information into the real world. In addition to higher  image quality and lower power consumption, there is also a growing  need for built-in sensors and greater flexibility of design. Organic Light  Emitting Diode (OLED) displays, which are used widely in smartphones  and televisions, are expected to expand to a wide range of applications,  including IT and automotive, because of their high image quality and  design qualities. Foldable displays, in particular, are predicted to further  expand the potential of information devices. Along with the growing demand for such high-performance displays,  control technology for defective modes and stable performance are becoming more important than ever for FPD  production equipment. Furthermore, as the number of manufacturing processes increases, so too does the need to  use energy and materials more efficiently in order to successfully reduce environmental impact.  Our product lineup includes the Impressio™ and the Betelex™ FPD etch/ash systems, the Exceliner™ FPD coater/ developer and the Elius™ inkjet printing system for manufacturing OLED displays. Impressio and Betelex use PICP™4, a  plasma module with improved energy efficiency, reducing power consumption by up to 20%, and achieving precise  processing and stability in mass production. We have also released PICP™ Pro, a new plasma module for high- definition displays which achieves both yield improvements and mass production stability by reducing the generation  of particles. The Exceliner, equipped with our original Air Floating Coater, permits higher throughput while maintaining  excellent film uniformity and saving chemical costs. The Elius inkjet printing system can significantly reduce the  amount of OLED materials used in the manufacturing process compared to conventional vapor deposition methods,  and is also suited to production on large substrates. We are proceeding with development and sales of the Elius series  ahead of the imminent era of large, high-definition OLED. We will continue contributing to the further development of diverse display products, tackling effective  technological innovation based on market needs such as improving productivity and yield and using energy and  materials more efficiently.

Systems for Creating Value for Customers The semiconductor market has been expanding significantly, driven by the acceleration of IoT, the global launch of  commercial 5G services and the growth of device-to-device communication such as the automated driving of cars.  In fiscal year 2021, faced with various regulations around the world as a consequence of the spread of COVID-19,  including curfews, restrictions on travel and isolation measures, Tokyo Electron aggressively worked to maintain  active communication throughout all the Group companies so that we could continue to develop our business while  strengthening cooperation with our global business sites. We also expanded the use of remote tools and strived to  further strengthen our systems to provide customers with seamless high-value-added solutions, not only in sales  activities but also in service support.  Since 2018, we have worked to further strengthen our customer responsiveness through two divisions: our  Account Sales Division, which leads to new technology development based on the needs of traditional customers of  major semiconductor manufacturers for next-generation leading-edge technology such as memory, logic and  foundry; and our Global Sales Division, which responds to the needs of more than 100 customers in Japan and  overseas who deal in communication devices and image sensors for the IoT market as well as power devices and  other products. By building stronger, close collaborative relationships with each business unit and, moreover, with  overseas subsidiaries, our respective sales divisions quickly provide customers with the technology, support and  solutions they need. We accurately grasp the issues and requirements of our customers in their product development and  manufacturing operations, and provide this as feedback to our main development and manufacturing sites in a  timely manner. To this end, we are working to further improve the level of our engineers involved in equipment  installation and maintenance, who act as a frontline link between our customers and us. We are also building a global  organization and developing proactive, flexible operations in order to respond quickly and accurately to customer  needs as markets change.  In addition, we are working to build globally unified systems and structures in order to further enhance and  stabilize the quality of our service support activities. The Global Service Committee, a regular gathering of service  leaders from relevant domestic departments and overseas subsidiaries, enhances information sharing and in-house  coordination related to improving the technical skills and interpersonal skills of our more than 4,000 field engineers  worldwide, the localization of startups and improving work efficiency using the work-time management system. At  our Total Support Centers (TSCs1), we operate our TELeMetrics™2 remote maintenance service, and provide  customers with high-value-added services by utilizing our wealth of knowledge and range of tools to propose  customized solutions for the various challenges they face. Proposing Customer Solutions Leveraging a Broad Portfolio of Products In a market where applications for semiconductors are ever-expanding, in order to meet the needs of production sites,  such as improved yield and improved equipment efficiency per-unit area through enhanced productivity and smaller  footprints, we are practicing product development initiated from the customer perspective.  Two of our divisions work closely together in turning that perspective into products. Specifically, our Account Sales  Division identifies customer demands for next-generation technology and beyond, and based on these, our Corporate  Innovation Division reviews the requirements and converts them into actual, tangible products. In addition to developing leading-edge technologies, we are also continuously improving the performance of our  mass production equipment, so that we can proactively respond to the needs of our customers spanning multiple  generations. In proposing solutions to customers, we leverage a broad portfolio of equipment, including those used in  the series of key patterning processes requiring advanced technical abilities, such as deposition, coating/development,  etching and cleaning. Through optimal solutions that incorporate systems and software in addition to production  equipment, we seek to optimize the production process. We strive to develop products that help strengthen our  customers’ competitiveness by achieving a balance between faster and better-quality semiconductor production. 1 TSC: Total Support  Center. Refer to p. 23 2 TELeMetricsTM: Refer to p.  24 Field Solutions Business In the area of semiconductors, as improvements are made in the performance of CPUs1 and memory, as advances are  made in miniaturization for mass production and as transistors used in autonomous driving systems and VR2/AR  become increasingly integrated, demand is increasing across a wide range of fields, such as medical treatment, finance,  transportation and manufacturing. To meet this demand, it is becoming extremely important for our customers to  improve the utilization rate of their equipment.  We are working to further strengthen our field solutions business with the aim of ensuring that shipped equipment can  operate stably in the market over a long period. We are engaged in promoting knowledge management in field service,  continuously improving our field engineers’ skills, and strengthening our global support system through Total Support  Centers (TSCs). Furthermore, in order to comply with various regulations due to COVID-19, including restrictions on  overseas travel and isolation measures when traveling internationally, we will help to maximize our customers’ business  operations by proceeding to develop remote maintenance support and educational tools. Advanced Logistics As demand grows for semiconductors in a wide range of industries, we  are working hard to further strengthen our logistics to secure a stable  supply of equipment and parts, not only in response to the spread of  COVID-19 and unseasonably bad weather, but also from the  perspective of our business continuity plan.  As part of building systems that enable us to provide customers with  a continuous supply of equipment and parts, in March 2021, we began  operation of our second logistics center in Japan, a 6,000 m2 facility  located in Funabashi City, Chiba Prefecture. The center will be operated using third party logistics (3PL3), whereby  both physical distribution and warehouse operations are outsourced to a single company, and in the future, in addition to  considering expansion of the facility to cope with increased shipments, we will aim for an efficient and flexible logistics  system capable of responding to change. The full-scale operation of this new logistics center will enable us to provide our  customers in Japan with a more stable supply of equipment and parts. In the future, to further strengthen our response  to overseas customers, we will continue to build our logistics, including the expansion of facilities. Total Support Center Having established Total Support Centers (TSCs) in Japan, the United States, China and Europe, we will support  overseas subsidiaries through our global network centered around Japan.  At each TSC, dedicated representatives maintain and utilize a database of information about customers’ equipment  and examples of similar incidents. The TSCs also employ TELeMetricsTM to perform remote maintenance. In fiscal year  2021, we established a system where TSCs around the world support each other, taking advantage of time differences  in each region. These initiatives have enabled us to respond to inquiries and problems from customers around the  world with greater speed and precision than ever before. 1 CPU: Central Processing  Unit. A typical  component of a  computer, alongside  memory and hard disks. 2 VR: Virtual Reality.  Technology that creates  a virtual world  resembling reality in a  computer. 3 3PL: Third-Party  Logistics. Arrangement  whereby not only  physical distribution  but also warehouse  operations are  outsourced as a  package. Remote Support System We promote remote support using TELeMetricsTM to minimize any downtime of production equipment, to detect  abnormal operation before any major defect occurs and to support the stable operation of equipment.  With the growing need to support field engineers remotely due to travel restrictions and various state regulations as  a consequence of the spread of COVID-19, we worked on developing an advanced remote support system whereby  audio and video from a customer’s manufacturing site can be shared in real time and the confidentiality of information  can be better enhanced.  Starting in fiscal year 2021, we have also been working to enhance the convenience and quality of remote support  by adding our own unique features to our existing smart glasses4 system, including information protection, restricted  image transmission and phone translation. Knowledge Management We promote knowledge management1 throughout the entire Group so that we can deliver high-quality service swiftly  to our customers. In the area of field service, we have built Service CRM2 so that we can create a database and  centrally manage customer equipment support and incident histories. Service CRM began operating in Japan in fiscal  year 2020 and is currently being rolled out globally.  In addition, by taking advantage of knowledge management tools such as Equipment Records and Knowledge  Search, comprehensive searches can be performed on multiple systems, helping to reduce the amount of time spent  on work. Equipment Records enables batch searches of equipment work histories based on equipment serial numbers,  including past repair information for customers and parts replacement histories. Knowledge Search, which was  revamped in October 2020, enables users to enter keywords of equipment-related problems to carry out batch  searches of files and documents saved in the database based on past trouble information. In fiscal year 2022, we are  working on making the tools multilingual so that, in addition to Japanese and English, they can also support Korean  and Chinese. Not only by increasing the number of languages supported to improve the work efficiency of our globally  active field engineers, but also by promoting efforts to manage the various systems throughout the entire Group using  One Platform3, we will strive to further improve our customer responsiveness. 3 One Platform: An  initiative to manage  information using a  standardized database  and system. Refer to  Continuous  Improvement of  Business Operations on  p. 28. Upgrading Engineers’ Skills  At our training operations center established in 2019 to enhance the training structure and globalization of field  engineers, a group-wide common skills management system has been established that meets the standards of  SEMATECH (a U.S. consortium for the joint development of semiconductors). The system helps us to deploy the most  suitable human resources to provide customers with service based on an objective understanding of the skills of our  engineers.  In fiscal year 2021, we began providing education for expert engineers to improve the skills of engineers at our  overseas subsidiaries. The education includes training programs that enable technical support engineers from overseas  to learn advanced development skills in a practical manner at our manufacturing sites in Japan. Furthermore,  established in fiscal year 2021, our Global Data Engineering Team is also rolling out a program designed to train field  engineers as data analysts specializing in Digital Transformation1. Providing Information to Customers Tokyo Electron is committed to providing sufficient safety information on our products to  ensure that customers can safely use them. All products purchased by customers come with  a TEL Safety and Environmental Guidelines manual. The manual describes examples of  potential risks associated with using our products together with the methods for averting  those risks, as well as safety measures applied to products and recommended methods for  product disposal. It is divided into such categories as chemical, electrical, mechanical and  ergonomic. The manual is available in 12 languages2 to ensure that customers around the  world can understand the content accurately and safely use the products. In addition to the  TEL Safety and Environmental Guidelines manual, customers are also provided product- specific manuals tailored to the relevant product specifications. If new safety warnings are identified after the product ships, we provide information to  affected customers. We also strive to ensure that necessary information is communicated to  any customers to whom we deliver products that involve the use of hazardous chemicals or  high voltage electricity. Global Expansion of Training for Customers We have established training centers all over the world, mainly at our development and production sites, and are  providing customers with training on equipment operation and maintenance to ensure they are able to use the  products safely. In fiscal year 2021, demand for Web-Based Training (WBT) and Remote Training3 increased as a result  of the difficulty in holding equipment training on-site because of COVID-19.  While we have started remote training for much of our equipment, we are working to improve the content and  quality of our WBT and remote training by sharing the equipment and methods we introduced with each of the  training centers. Going forward, we will continue to give priority to customer safety as we promote further  development of our training environment. Safe Design of Equipment Taking the entire product life cycle into consideration, we carry out product risk assessments as early as possible in the  development phase. Based on the assessment results, we implement safe equipment design4 to reduce the risks posed  to humans. We also examine and ensure compliance with increasingly strict laws and regulations around the globe,  and have a system in place for all safety regulations of the regions where our equipment is delivered. We conduct compliance checks through third-party assessment bodies on the equipment we ship to ensure  compliance with international safety standards such as SEMI S25 and CE-Marking6. Additionally, we work with overseas  subsidiaries to take appropriate measures to comply with the laws and regulations of each country and region. 1 Digital Transformation:  Refer to p. 19 5 SEMI S2: This is a set of  environmental, health  and safety guidelines for  semiconductor  production equipment.  It is used mainly by the  leading manufacturers of  semiconductor  equipment in the United  States and Europe, not  only for semiconductors  but also as safe  procurement guidelines  for electric and electronic  device manufacturing  equipment around the  world. 6 CE marking: When  exporting into the  European Union, CE  marking defines rules for  displaying a CE mark as  proof that the  equipment is safe and  complies with  EU-defined rules  (Directives). Customer Satisfaction Survey We conduct a Customer Satisfaction Survey (TEL CS Survey) every year with the goal of making continual  improvements based on customer feedback. The survey started in fiscal year 2004, aimed at just a limited number of  divisions. It was expanded to include all semiconductor production equipment divisions in fiscal year 2014, and later  the flat panel display production equipment division and overseas subsidiaries in fiscal year 2016, and currently, it is  implemented company-wide as the Customer Satisfaction Survey Program (CSSP). Under the CSSP, we survey customers once a year, at the same time each year, and ask specific questions that will  lead to improvements on a practical level. Information obtained from the survey is analyzed by business unit  (product), account (customer) and function (software, development, etc.), and the results of this are shared with  relevant divisions, such as sales, equipment/plants and service, to implement actions for improvement. Improvements  are also made continuously to all aspects of the survey method, including the questions asked, the analytical methods  used, and the overall operation of the survey activities. In the TEL CS Survey for fiscal year 2021, responses were received from approximately 1,400 individual customers  (70.2% of all customers), and 96.7% of all survey items received a score of 3 points or higher (Very Satisfied or  Satisfied1), which is our annual CSR goal. This marked an improvement of 3.4 percentage points from fiscal year 2020.  When we receive an evaluation of 1 point (Very Dissatisfied), we respond to the customer as quickly as possible as part  of a Shift Left approach to implementing early-stage improvements throughout the survey process. Going forward, we  will continue to aim for 3 points or higher for 100% of the questions asked, and the entire company will work as one to  implement customer-driven improvements. Improvement Example At a business unit that handles one of our product lines, the results for fiscal year 2018 fell below a score of 3 points in  all three divisions (sales, equipment/plants and service), so we have been working on various improvements. Based on  the results of the TEL CS Survey, the Management Council immediately reviewed the results and formulated KPIs2, and  has since monitored the situation every quarter. The following improvement measures have been implemented for  issues identified for each customer in past survey results. By going through the PDCA cycle for these improvement measures, we were able to achieve a target score of 3  points or higher in the sales, equipment/plants and service divisions in the survey for fiscal year 2021. As a result, these  improvements have led to stronger products and we were able to confirm that overall customer satisfaction for our  company has improved. ■	Explain our strategies to customers to gain their understanding ■	Improve the frequency of customer visits  ■	Form an internal task force to make continual improvements for equipment-related issues ■	Promote direct communication between customers and our engineers  ■	Clarify ownership of each issue at a meeting to address issues, etc. 96.7% 2 KPI: Key performance  indicator. An  evaluation indicator  for managing the  progress of  improvements Tokyo Electron is striving to promote the standardization and automation of operations and improve productivity along the  entire value chain, such as through the development of an enterprise resource planning system and the integration of  business systems in each division and unification of databases. In addition, recognizing the importance of quality  management, we are striving to further improve business efficiency by implementing quality focus operations. We are enhancing the awareness and capabilities of each employee regarding productivity by rolling out various educational  programs. In addition, we are implementing continuous quality improvement activities throughout the entire supply chain  in collaboration with suppliers. We will strive to enhance corporate value, constantly pursuing improved productivity. Initiatives for Higher Productivity  As a manufacturer of semiconductors and flat panel display production equipment, we are committed to continuously  improving productivity while remaining focused on safety and quality in operations along the entire value chain.  Specifically, under the slogan “Safety First3”, we are striving to improve the safety and work environments of every  person connected with our business activities, and we are building quality management systems and pursuing quality  improvement in the value chain in order to understand the true needs of our customers and to achieve the world’s  best quality. We are also conducting company-wide activities for compliance with safety and environmental laws and  regulations and to make software development more efficient and smarter. In manufacturing operations, our current  initiatives include BOM4 production, module shipment5 for repeat orders and the building of flow lines6.  Furthermore, to respond swiftly to customer requests and market fluctuations, we are improving our IT  infrastructure and computerizing on-site data by establishing a production system that centralizes all production- related information and introduces a manufacturing execution system (MES7). By utilizing the wide range of data  aggregated through these systems in each business operation, we can make production schedules more reasonable  and more efficient, visualize delivery dates for parts, and achieve stronger coordination between sales planning and  production/procurement/inventory planning. In this way, we will comprehensively promote higher productivity in  business operations.  In our manufacturing and logistics operations, where we deal with a wide variety of components, we are also  working on labor savings and efficiency improvements by establishing automated warehouses, introducing a  warehousing navigation system and promoting automated inspections. Continuous Improvement of Business Operations Tokyo Electron is currently introducing a new enterprise system (ERP1) to improve productivity and quality further. The  new ERPs, being integrated across operational and national boundaries, is aimed at creating the following five benefits:  (1) compliance with the new revenue recognition standards in Japan; (2) business and management decision making  with quick response to change; (3) large improvements in business operation efficiency; (4) utilization of globally  integrated information with an eye toward overall digital transformation2; and (5) realization of ultimate work style  reform. Beginning with business operational improvement, we are contributing to the resolution of issues from  COVID-19 with global progress in the expansion of telecommuting, the shift to online approval operations, and overall  digitalization. In fiscal year 2021, we made progress in communication and consensus-building that included our headquarters,  manufacturing sites in Japan, and overseas subsidiaries, as well as partner companies, to form a globally unified team  toward business innovation. In May 2021, the new ERPs began operation, primarily at our headquarters. While making  the most of the knowledge gained from this process and the results, we plan to realize a true globally integrated  system, with project members and all our employees working as one. 1 ERP: Enterprise resource  planning.

A  system for  understanding and  managing production  processes and for  providing instructions  and support to workers. Streamlining Product Development and Improving Added Value Since 1995, we have incorporated platform software developed in-house in our semiconductor production  equipment and have worked on streamlining operations and improving product quality. By standardizing  platform software, we have been able to reduce the hours spent on developing various types of duplicate  functions for each type of equipment, leading to guaranteed real-time1 control and enhancement of our response  to new demands and technologies. Having adopted such concepts as object-oriented2, we are also working on  more efficient development of new platform software for next-generation equipment. In fiscal year 2021, as a new base for the digital transformation activities we are promoting, we established TEL  Digital Design Square, and aim to further improve the added value that our products provide through software  development. Developing Smart Equipment Amid advances in manufacturing that make the most of innovative technologies such as IoT and AI, our customers are  forging ahead in improving productivity by taking advantage of visual representations of data and building smart fabs3  to improve consistency in quality. Under these circumstances, we will provide advanced equipment operation services  and promote “equipment data management” to further enhance the added value of equipment, based on the various  types of data generated by customers’ equipment. Approach to Quality Tokyo Electron has defined its approach to quality as follows: “The Tokyo Electron Group seeks to provide the highest-quality products and services. This pursuit of quality begins  at development and continues through all manufacturing, installation, maintenance, sales and support processes. Our  employees must work to deliver quality products, quality services and innovative solutions that enable customer  success”. We strive to implement own-process assurance systems by carrying out strict risk management and development/ design inspections beginning at the development stage and also by ensuring verification of customers’ operations  using simulations. We have also built an important component traceability system as part of our effort to strengthen  our information environment. By making it possible to use the One Platform1 to view such information as past  problems and adjustment values used during manufacturing and assembly, as well as important component  inspection information from suppliers, we have successfully strengthened our risk management (FMEA2) to prevent  various types of non-conformance. We believe that thorough implementation of these own-process assurance  systems and prevention makes it possible for employees to focus on high value-added business operations and  promote initiatives that lead to Shift Left3 (front-loading). We will continue to strive to provide high-quality and  high-value-added products and services to our customers. Management System To provide consistent, high-quality products, we have built quality assurance systems under the leadership of our  Representative Director, President & CEO. We have been promoting ISO 9001 quality management system certification,  and all of our manufacturing companies within  our group have completed the transition to ISO 9001:2015. Quality Focus  Focusing on quality to satisfy customers, meet production schedules and reduce required maintenance  even with temporary cost increases. 2. Quality Design and Assurance  Building quality into products and assuring in-process quality control, from the design and development  phase throughout every process. 3.  Quality and Trust  When a quality-related problem occurs, working as a team to perform thorough root cause analyses and  resolve problems as quickly as possible. 4. Continual Improvement  Ensuring customer satisfaction and trust by establishing quality goals and performance indicators and by  implementing continual improvement using the PDCA cycle. 5. Stakeholder Communication  Listening to stakeholder expectations, providing timely product quality information and making  adjustments as needed. 1 One Platform: A  platform that makes it  possible to easily view  multiple different  systems as seamless  information sources in  order to effectively and  efficiently achieve  traceability. Refer to p. 28 2 FMEA: Failure mode  and effects analysis.  Method to identify,  prevent and mitigate  risks in advance. 3 Shift Left: Refer to p. 17 Measures to Prevent Quality Problems from Occurring and Recurring To comply with ISO and EN2 safety standards and achieve higher safety levels, we have established our own design  rules for each of our products. As an equipment manufacturer, we have developed systems for manufacturing  products, which include safety considerations. We have other systems in place for responding to equipment design  and production non-conformance and any occupational accidents. In the event of an accident, we use our TIRS3 accident reporting system to distribute information to safety and  quality personnel in each division, officers and management, including senior management. An accident investigation  is also conducted immediately to identify the cause and plan preventive measures. We use a proprietary system called QA-BOX4 to share information on equipment quality and any major non- conformance across all quality departments in accordance with our operating rules. Measures obtained from the  results of an accident investigation are promptly applied, not only to the problem equipment but also to relevant  equipment operated by other customers, and revisions are also made to the current design standards. Additionally, we  work to prevent a recurrence of the accident by analyzing the factors that led to the human error and creating  procedures that are easier to understand. In operating “QA-BOX”, we validate the commonalities among accidents and share the issues and countermeasures  in regularly scheduled meetings attended by the Quality General Manager (GMs) responsible for various types of  equipment. This allows us to examine various approaches to prevent similar non-conformances from occurring in any  of our equipment. Furthermore, by managing the progress of the cases shared in QA-BOX and validating the effects of  the measures, we ensure the implementation of effective measures and reduce the number of equipment-caused  accidents. ■	Example Initiatives We are focused on process improvement activities (PCS1) using a statistical method. Invariably, our customers’  production sites require limited variations in quality between equipment, accurate process repeatability and high  productivity. To meet these requirements, we ask our suppliers who handle specific important components to  understand the importance of PCS and cooperate with us. Putting the information acquired from various types of  important components into control diagrams and carrying out trend analyses together with our suppliers allows us to  quickly detect changes in manufacturing processes and take any necessary steps. These supplier activities and the  continuous implementation of PCS activities in our manufacturing processes are leading to the suppression of  component quality variability and maintenance/improvement of manufacturing processes that produce quality  products, ultimately helping us provide products surpassing customer expectations. Since new technologies are being  created daily and customer needs are constantly increasing, manufacturing processes that handle new important  components need to be constantly reexamined and improved. Our products consist of tens of thousands of  components, and the task of selecting important components that are especially relevant to customers’ production  and tallying and analyzing them regularly requires many hours. To optimize and streamline this task, we reexamine our  operational flow, including the adoption of automation, and improve our systems by collecting information from  customers, holding discussions among our manufacturing sites in Japan, and interviewing our suppliers. By  continuously carrying out these activities that incorporate the concept of Shift Left, we are striving to improve our  productivity further. Ensuring Self-Process Assurance Systems and Promoting “Shift Left” In order to improve the quality of products, it is important to prevent non-conformance from occurring in upstream  processes and to ensure thorough quality control in each process so that nonconforming products are not allowed to  flow into later processes. From this perspective, we promote activities focused on self-process assurance systems. In  particular, we aim to improve the level of completion of product quality by implementing thorough risk detection and  mitigation measures (FMEA) from the initial stages of product design, as well as carrying out thorough inspections in  each process and conducting verification using simulation. Improving the precision of each process and reducing reworking costs in these activities for self-process assurance  systems have enabled us to create high-value-added technologies and products in the upstream processes, leading to  the promotion of the Shift Left concept. We are also promoting Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) by using self- process assurance systems to comprehensively manage and analyze all processes from product planning,  development, design and production through to service, in an effort to facilitate the earlier release of products,  enhance operational efficiency, improve quality and reduce costs. 2 EN: European Norm.  Uniform standard for the  European Union  complimenting parts of  technical standards not  stated in European  Commission directives  (“New Approach”  directives). ■	Example Initiatives  Having identified reduction of costs for dealing with defective components and unit parts  at customer sites as a material issue, since March 2020, the quality assurance division at  Tokyo Electron Technology Solutions have been promoting quality improvement activities  focused on a single point. As part of these activities, we categorized defects at all business  units (BUs) by cause, and found that 31% were due to inadequate internal evaluation and  15% were related to our suppliers. There was also a tendency for defects attributable to  inadequate internal evaluation to be higher for equipment using new technology and for  large equipment such as flat panel display (FPDs), and defects related to our suppliers to  be higher for other equipment. Based on analysis of the present situation, each BU raises quality improvements that  warrant a concerted effort, and proceeds with measures while considering what quality should be like. For example, at  DSP3 Dept. (ES BU) and FPD BU, technical and quality assurance divisions cooperate with suppliers from the planning  stage for new equipment, and by using FMEA to extract specific evaluation details, conduct evaluations that take into  account the environment in which the customer will use the equipment. TFF BU and TS BU, meanwhile, have been  conducting activities aimed at achieving zero defects for components and unit parts with a high frequency of defects, and  we are gradually seeing the results of these activities. ES BU and CT BU are also conducting their own quality  improvement activities using the “single point of focus” approach in an effort to resolve important matters. Together with our suppliers, we will continue striving to further improve the quality of our components and unit parts  by continuously rolling out initiatives, including the “single point of focus” approach. Initiatives with Suppliers Continuously improving quality based on strong partnerships with suppliers is essential for providing high-quality  products quickly to the market. Since fiscal year 2001, we have conducted our unique Supplier Total Quality Assessments  (STQA) in an effort to ensure our suppliers properly understand the level of quality expected from them. Before starting a  new business with suppliers, an STQA is conducted via self-assessment to evaluate their product quality, costs and  information security. The assessment also includes their CSR initiatives, including human rights, ethics, safety and the  environment. If a risk is identified, we visit the supplier and confirm the area of non-conformance on-site. Once our  approach to quality has been shared with the supplier, we request that they plan and implement improvement measures,  and we provide continuous support until all of them have been completed. In addition, we also conduct audits once every  three years for suppliers who handle important components and for suppliers where quality issues have been found. Also,  in the course of holding regular meetings with the leaders of various manufacturing sites in Japan who use STQA, a  system shared by our whole Group, we share supplier-related information and discuss measures to resolve issues.  Additionally, Tokyo Electron Kyushu is working with its suppliers on its own improvement activities. For suppliers  judged to require focused evaluation, we add technically focused check items to STQA, based on past case examples of  non-conformance, and carry out assessment to prevent recurrence. By continuing these activities, we technically  strengthen preventive measures and increase their effectiveness, linking them to further quality improvement. 2 FCN: Field change  notice. Refers to the  general recall notice. Tokyo Electron is endeavoring to build a strong and sound management foundation that supports the entire Group's business  operations. Regarding problems of climate change and abnormal weather, which have increased in severity in recent years,  endeavoring to preserve the global environment, we have been working hard to achieve the medium- and long-term environmental  goals for our products, plants and offices in order to preserve the global environment along our entire value chain. In terms of  practical initiatives for respecting human rights, based on our Human Rights Policy, which summarizes the entire Group's guiding  principles on human rights, as well as implementing extensive education and awareness-raising efforts, we are expanding human  rights due diligence (impact assessment and remediation) and grievance processes. Based on the recognition that people are the  source of a company’s growth, we deeply appreciate the new value created by individual employees exercising their capabilities,  while respecting their individuality and values and encouraging work styles in sync with their respective lifestyles. To ensure that  operational decision-making and supervisory functions are exercised sufficiently, we are striving to build a highly effective corporate  governance system to realize medium- to long-term growth while considering corporate culture and business characteristics, and  also strengthening risk management and thoroughly enforcing compliance. As for supply chains, we are promoting activities in  compliance with global standards to achieve sustainable operations together with customers and suppliers. Corporate governance framework,  Sustainability of a Board of Directors  appropriate for resolution of  management issues, Process for  evaluating the effectiveness of the Board  of Directors and management issues, etc. Approach to risk management,   Risk management system and initiatives,  etc. Approach to compliance,   Compliance system, etc. Corporate Governance Framework Tokyo Electron upholds the vision of being “a truly global company generating high added value and profits in the semiconductor  and flat panel display industries through innovative technologies and groundbreaking proactive solutions that integrate diverse  technologies.” With over 80% of our sales coming from overseas, we regard building governance structure as essential in order to  achieve success in global competition, realize our vision and achieve sustainable growth. To that end, we have built a framework  to maximize the use of worldwide resources, and have worked to incorporate a wide range of opinions to strengthen our  management foundation and technology base, establishing a governance structure capable of ensuring that we attain global- level earnings power. We use the Audit & Supervisory Board System, which consists of a Board of Directors and an Audit & Supervisory Board, and  has achieved effective governance based on the supervision of management by the Audit & Supervisory Board. Furthermore, in  addition to the Board of Directors, whose role is to make major operational decisions and play a supervisory role in the executive  management’s execution, and support appropriate risk-taking by them, we have established systems that facilitate growth- oriented governance directed at sustainable growth, including the following: (1) the Nomination Committee and Compensation  Committee to ensure fair, effective, and transparent management; (2) the Corporate Senior Staff (CSS) to formulate and advance  company strategy; and (3) the Business Execution Meeting, to play a role in deliberations of the executive management. Sustainability of a Board of Directors Appropriate for Resolution of Management Issues As a leading company in semiconductor and flat panel display (FPD) production equipment, we believe that proactive risk-taking  and a risk management structure to support it are essential for achieving sustainable growth. The Board of Directors guides its  discussions in an appropriate direction by incorporating a wide range of opinions that stem from the extensive knowledge and  experience of independent outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members in addition to executive directors who are  well-versed in the business.  We have also established the Nomination Committee and the Compensation Committee as discretionary advisory bodies to  ensure fairness, effectiveness and transparency in management. Authorized to propose the appointment and dismissal of the  CEO and corporate directors, the Nomination Committee has established guidelines on their required qualities and eligibility, as  well as a trigger for considering the appointment and dismissal of the CEO, and strives to ensure the objectivity, timeliness and  transparency of the procedures for appointment and dismissal. The Compensation Committee, on the other hand, reviews  performance evaluations of the CEO and corporate directors along with the appropriateness of the amount of their  compensation, with reference to advice from external experts. Under such a system, we strive to operate the Board of Directors in a way that is appropriate for resolving management issues.  In addition, in order to develop the next generation of human resources who will assume management of operations to  support our sustainable growth, the CEO and Representative Directors play the primary role in constantly anticipating successor  candidates, primarily from among executive officers, evaluating their skills, character, dignity and insight from multiple  perspectives in the course of performing day-to-day duties, and continually supporting the education of the candidates through  assignment, training and other opportunities. Skills Matrix  In view of our Corporate Philosophy that “We strive to contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring society through  our leading-edge technologies and reliable service and support,” we are engaged in enhancing our governance structure and  in sustainability-focused management in order to respond to changes in the global environment, achieve success in global  competition, and realize sustainable growth and increased corporate value over the  medium to long term to respond to the  mandate from our stakeholders. We believe that our corporate directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members have the  necessary qualifications to realize these initiatives. Described in detail below, all of them have knowledge of global business,  governance, sustainability and so on. In addition to this matrix of individual skills, we also disclose the overall diversity of our  Board of Directors in an easy-to-understand format. Supervision and Evaluation of Strategic Decision-making Setting our strategic direction is recognized as the main role of the Board of Directors. It engages in constructive debate of  management strategy, management plans, and other matters. It serves as the venue for supervising progress on the  Medium-term Management Plan and other matters. The Board of Directors also seeks reports and explanations on the  status of deliberations at the Business Execution Meeting to monitor whether decision making by executive management  functions properly in relation to matters for which approval authority has been delegated to executive management. At  Board of Directors meetings, independent outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members actively provide advice  and ask questions regarding the matters and reports made by executive directors well versed in business. The combined  perspectives of both parties have enabled the Board of Directors meetings to achieve an appropriate sense of productive  tension and constructive discussions that are essential for business execution decisions and supervision. To obtain appropriate advice and questions from independent outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members,  the administrative office provides them with explanations on proposals in advance of the Board of Directors meeting as  needed. For matters of particular importance, we establish a venue for dialogue between independent outside directors and  Audit & Supervisory Board members and executive management, striving to provide sufficient information to, and engage  dialogue with, independent outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members. Policies for Allocation of Earnings Our basic stance is for the appropriate allocation of company earnings to all stakeholders. Our dividend policy to  shareholders is to link dividend payments to business performance on an ongoing basis and maintain a payout ratio of  around 50% based on net income attributable to owners of the parent company. Furthermore, we also set the  minimum annual dividend at 150 yen per share in light of the stable distribution of dividends. We effectively use  internal capital reserves to raise corporate value through earnings growth by concentrating investment in high-growth  areas and provide returns directly to shareholders by linking dividend payments to business performance. Furthermore,  we flexibly consider implementing repurchases of treasury stocks as part of returning earnings to shareholders. Establishment of the Director Compensation System As our basic policies on executive compensation, we emphasize (1) levels and plans for compensation to secure highly  competent management personnel with global competitiveness; (2) high linkage with business performance in the short  term and medium- and long-term increase of corporate value aimed at sustainable growth; and (3) securement of  transparency and fairness in the decision process of compensation and appropriateness of compensation. Compensation  for inside directors consists of fixed basic compensation, annual performance-linked compensation and medium-term  performance-linked compensation. Compensation for outside directors consists of fixed basic compensation and non- performance-linked (stock-based) compensation. Compensation for Audit & Supervisory Board members consists solely  of fixed basic compensation in consideration of their role being primarily the audit and supervision of management. In order to secure transparency and fairness in management and appropriateness of compensation, the Compensation  Committee, which an independent outside director chairs, utilizes advice from an external expert, compares  compensation levels with those of industry peers in Japan and overseas, and analyzes the latest trends and best practices  in Japan and overseas (such as reflecting ESG in compensation). The committee then proposes to the Board of Directors a  compensation policy for corporate directors, a compensation system that is globally competitive and the most  appropriate for us, and individual compensation amounts for the representative directors. Fixed Basic Compensation Fixed basic compensation is determined in reference to the compensation standards of industry peers in Japan and  overseas. For inside directors, it also depends on the scale of their responsibilities based on the job grade framework  provided by the external specialist organization. Annual Performance-linked Compensation Annual performance-linked compensation consists of cash bonuses and stock compensation-based stock options at a  ratio of approximately 1:1. The specific amounts paid and the numbers of stock options granted are determined based  on the results of corporate business performance and individual performance evaluations for the relevant fiscal year.  Net income attributable to owners of the parent and consolidated ROE are adopted as evaluation indicators for  corporate business performance. Evaluation items for individual performance include the degree of contribution to  short-term and medium-term management strategy targets (including ESG). Medium-term Performance-linked Compensation Medium-term performance-linked compensation is a performance share (stock-based) compensation to motivate  recipients to contribute to improving medium-term business performance and raise awareness for enhancing  corporate value by sharing the perspective of shareholders through the holding of shares. The number of shares issued  to each corporate director varies according to the payout rate based on their respective responsibilities and level of  performance goal achievement over the relevant three-year period. Consolidated operating margin and consolidated  ROE have been adopted as indicators for measuring the levels of performance goal achievement which are linked to  the Medium-term Management Plan. Non-performance-linked (Stock-based) Compensation  Non-performance-linked stock-based compensation has been introduced for the purpose of making the  compensation system for outside directors more consistent with their expected role of, in addition to supervising  management, giving advice to management from the perspective of increasing corporate value over the medium to  long term. Under this Stock-based compensation system, shares are granted after the expiration of the applicable  period (three fiscal years), which is set each year. Risk Management System and Initiatives In order to promote more effective risk management, we carry out enterprise risk management1 through a body  established within the General Affairs Department at our headquarters. This body works with the respective  departments responsible for each operation to identify a wide range of risks arising in business activities, such as  compliance risk, human resource and labor risk, and business continuity risk. It then classifies risks with high impact  and probability as our key risks. The body also formulates and executes measures to minimize these key risks, monitors  the effect of said measures, as well as works to understand the status of risk control, and implements the PDCA cycle  for risk management. In fiscal year 2021 we introduced CSA2 and started a risk management committee. We will  continue these activities going forward. By continuing to strengthen and progress risk management activities  throughout our Group, we will implement risk management that is more effective than ever before. Process for Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors and Management Issues To evaluate the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, including the Nomination Committee and Compensation  Committee, we conduct questionnaire surveys of all corporate directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members, as well  as individual interviews with some corporate directors and Audit & Supervisory Board members. We also conduct opinion  exchanges and deliberations with a group comprised mostly of outside directors and Audit & Supervisory Board  members. The results of this questionnaire, summaries of interviews and the content of deliberations are then shared  with the entire Board of Directors before deliberating and comprehensively evaluating the effectiveness of the Board of  Directors. We appoint a third party to provide advice on setting assessment items and to conduct, aggregate and analyze  the interviews in an effort to increase objectivity. In terms of the evaluation results in fiscal year 2021, open and dynamic discussions were held at Board of Directors  meetings and off-site meetings. We recognize that the Board of Directors, including the Nomination Committee and  Compensation Committee, is functioning in an effective manner. In light of the results of this evaluation, we will continue our efforts to have fuller discussions regarding medium- to  long-term management strategies, promote diversity, strengthen group governance at a global level, and share  appropriate information with the Nomination Committee, Compensation Committee and Board of Directors. Engagement with Capital Markets Our management actively engages in Investor Relations (IR) and Shareholder Relations (SR) activities to contribute to our  sustainable growth and increase corporate value over the medium to long term. The Chairman of the Board, CEO and  corporate director in charge of finance serve as spokespersons as required at IR conferences in and outside Japan and strive to  engage directly with investors. In addition to holding quarterly earnings release conferences, we actively share our business  strategies and growth story at the Medium-term Management Plan briefings and on IR day. The IR Department, which was  established under the direct control of the CEO, also appropriately supplements the explanation through individual interviews  and regularly reports opinions from investors to management so that feedback can be of use in management. As a part of our shareholder relations activities, company executives play a central role in active and constructive  dialogue with our major institutional investors and proxy-advisory firms. In addition to explaining the Shareholders’  Meeting agenda, we continuously engage in dialogue on a wide range of topics, including the business environment, ESG  and sustainability initiatives, and respond to business risks and opportunities, including social and environmental issues, in  order to deepen mutual understanding. To encourage active discussion and facilitate smooth and efficient voting at  Shareholders’ Meetings, we send convocation notices at an early stage and also post the notice in both Japanese and  English on our website to provide information to shareholders in a timely manner. In addition, we analyze the results of  the exercise of voting rights and report to the Board of Directors to further enhance engagement with investors. Approach to Risk Management Reflecting changes in society and the business environment, the risks facing businesses are growing increasingly  complex and diverse. Tokyo Electron considers understanding and appropriately addressing the risks that it may face in  its businesses, as well as their impacts, to be essential to its sustainable growth. 2 CSA: Control Self- Assessment. Internal  risks and controls are  evaluated and  monitored by those who  are actually performing  the duties with the goal  of building and  maintaining an  autonomous risk  management system. Auditing by the Internal Audit Department The Global Audit Center serves as the internal audit department for the entire Group and implements audits based on  the audit plan. Based on the results of these audits, it provides instructions for making improvements as needed,  confirms the progress of these improvements, and provides any necessary support. The Group’s internal control over  financial reporting in fiscal year 2021 was also evaluated as effective by the independent auditors. Risk Management Initiatives We conduct Group-wide reviews to identify the current status of risk management as well as any potential and actual  risks surrounding the Company in the future. Based on the results of the reviews, we have identified the following 13  risks as having potential to cause significant issues to our financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and are  working to address them. Market  Fluctuations Geopolitics Research and  Development Delays in the launch of new products or the mismatch of such products with  customer needs could lead to a decline in the competitiveness of products Procurement,  Production and  Supply Safety Safety-related problems with the Company’s products could lead to damages  suffered by customers, liability for damages and a decline in credibility Quality The occurrence of a product defect could lead to liability for damages, costs for  countermeasures and a decline in credibility Laws and  Regulations 8.

We established a system centered around the  Vice President and General Manager,  Information Security, and are implementing  integrated security measures on a global scale. We established global standardized  information security rules and regularly  conduct checks on compliance status and  provided education for all relevant parties. We identify risks by conducting periodic risk  assessments and internal audits and  implement technological, human,  organizational and physical security  measures. We respond to customer requests and  monitor the status of security at suppliers  so that we can securely use confidential  information and customer information in  our business activities without  compromising  utility. To respond to cyberattacks and information  leaks, which are major security threats in  modern society, we actively introduce  advanced technologies and have  specialized organizations create systems to  establish mechanisms for reliable  monitoring. To prepare for the occurrence of security  incidents, we established a specialized  incident response organization and have  established systems so that we can share  incident information at an early stage and  promptly respond and recover. Approach to Compliance To practice Tokyo Electron’s Corporate Philosophy, it is vital that each employee performs their daily duties with strong  interest in and a deep understanding of compliance. We established “Tokyo Electron’s Code of Ethics” as a code of  conduct to ensure that our employees are aware of the risks around them and conduct themselves appropriately. We  have built a global system that can directly raise questions and concerns about compliance and business ethics to  quickly address potential problems. Compliance System In order to effectively promote a global compliance program, we have appointed a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and  established a dedicated Compliance Department at our headquarters. Additionally, people responsible for compliance  (Regional Compliance Controllers) have been appointed at key overseas sites, creating a system for direct reporting to  the Chief Compliance Officer and Compliance Department. The primary role of the Compliance Department is to  formulate and review our practical compliance programs, establish and implement business ethics, plan and  implement education and training, and establish and operate internal reporting systems. It also cooperates with the  Risk Management Business Support Group established within our General Affairs Department, regularly confirms the  observance of laws and regulations in each country as well as internal company rules at each Group company, and  assesses compliance risks. Furthermore, the Internal Audit Department conducts operational audits based on annual  plans, which leads to the improvement of findings as appropriate. Business Ethics In addition to establishing the Code of Ethics as the standard of conduct by which all executives and  employees should abide, we have also established an Ethics Committee to promote and raise  awareness of compliance and business ethics more effectively within the company. We have also set  up the Disciplinary Committee as a subordinate organization of the Ethics Committee for the  purpose of ensuring that reasonable and appropriate disciplinary action is taken and proper  procedures are followed. To ensure awareness of the Code of Ethics, we have translated it into five languages, including  Japanese, and have distributed it in the form of a booklet to all executives and employees. In fiscal  year 2021, the Code of Ethics was revised. In addition to reflecting standards required as a global  company, we added a number of new provisions on such important issues as personal data  protection, information security, and money laundering. In addition, in pursuit of clarity and  usability, we have made changes to the booklet design and adopted a bullet point format. We are  also striving to raise awareness of compliance and corporate ethics by regularly obtaining  confirmation from all executives and employees that they understand and comply with the revised content. Korea China Europe/Israel Taiwan Singapore/Malaysia Compliance Department (Headquarters) General Manager of Legal, Compliance Unit Representative Director, President & CEO Reports and consultations received via these points of contact are handled with sincerity, and investigations are  undertaken in accordance with internal regulations. If a compliance violation is found, disciplinary action is taken in  accordance with the Rules of Employment2, and preventive measures and corrective measures, such as improvements  to the workplace environment, are implemented as necessary.  In fiscal year 2021, a total of 82 cases were received via the internal reporting system, of which 6 were recognized as  compliance violations. The reports and requests for advice primarily related to harassment, but some concerned the  improper reporting of attendance and breaches of internal procedures. As a result, we have conducted regular  education programs for our employees to prevent harassment and have provided thorough follow-up with those  concerned or involved. There were no reports or cases of non-compliance that could have had a serious impact on our  business or on local communities. Compliance Training We conduct online and face-to-face training adapted to different levels for all employees1. We will systematically expand our  comprehensive training program and multilingual support, and reinforce efforts to foster compliance awareness and practice in  the company. Initiatives for Anti-Bribery and Corruption and for Competition Laws In fiscal year 2021, we established the company-wide Basic Policy on the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption, and  through regular education, we are working to promote understanding and awareness. Based on this basic policy, we  have prepared the Guidelines for Gifts, Hospitality and Entertainment, which stipulate specific, practical procedures  and standards on monetary amounts, and we have established a thorough process requiring prior approval for cases  outside these standards. Using questionnaires that we have prepared, we also regularly check the status of our  suppliers' efforts to prevent corruption and provide them with feedback on the results and areas for improvement as  required.  We have also established the company-wide Basic Policy on Competition Law Compliance, and have prepared,  disseminated and enforced guidelines that summarize different types of violations in an easy-to-understand format,  based on applicable laws and regulations in the countries and regions in which we operate. Internal Reporting System Preventing problems from occurring and resolving them before they become significant requires a system that allows  employees to raise questions and concerns about business ethics and compliance without reservation or hesitation  and to discuss them fully. For this reason, we have established an internal reporting system that ensures complete  confidentiality, anonymity and the prohibition of retribution so that employees can safely and reassuringly provide  information and seek redress outside the chain of command about behavior that is, or may be, in violation of laws,  regulations or business ethics.  Specifically, we have established and are operating the Tokyo Electron Group Ethics & Compliance Hotline—a global  common internal point of contact that uses a third-party system that is also accessible to our suppliers—as well as an  external point of contact that allows direct consultation with an outside law firm. The internal point of contact can be  accessed via phone or a dedicated website 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and accommodates all languages used by  employees. Relevant Divisions, etc. Report 1 Training and seminar  topics include basics of  corporate ethics and  compliance, anti- corruption, export  compliance, insider  trading prevention, the  Act for Subcontracting  and the prevention of  harassment. Some  training is limited to  certain employees. 2 A leniency system has  been introduced  whereby any  disciplinary action may  be reduced or  exempted in the event  the employee involved  in a compliance  violation has made a  report or sought advice  on his/her own volition. Human Resource Management For Tokyo Electron, corporate growth is about people. Employees are a foundation for creating value. Our aim is for  both the company and employees to grow together by engaging each employee at work and linking this to increased  productivity for the company as a whole. Specifically, we are taking initiatives focused on: (1) improving employee  development and engagement, such as through promoting support for career development, encouraging them to  stretch themselves and providing opportunities for skill and leadership development, (2) improving productivity  through developing the workplace environment, such as by using IT for better operational efficiency and promoting  smart work and (3) attracting outstanding talent such as through employer branding, strengthening partnerships with  universities and labs and promoting internships, including international ones. To expand these initiatives effectively,  human resources function has deployed a team supporting business on a global level. Employee Engagement Improving employee engagement is essential to maximize corporate  performance and achieve sustainable growth. Recognizing that employees  both create and fulfill company values for us, we have been regularly  conducting engagement surveys since fiscal year 2016 to assess the current  state of employee engagement and identify issues. Based on the results of the  surveys, our management takes the lead in making improvements to foster a  better workplace environment and culture. These initiatives resulted in an  increase in the employee engagement score of 12 points from fiscal year 2016  to fiscal year 2021 and a turnover rate of 2.5%. We plan to continue these  initiatives since we believe that improving employee engagement leads to  providing increased value to our stakeholders. Diversity and Inclusion At Tokyo Electron, diversity and inclusion are management pillars that lead to the continuous generation of innovation  and increased corporate value. We are actively pursuing them with the strong commitment of our management.  Although the areas of emphasis for diversity and inclusion vary by country, we have taken on gender and nationality as  major themes and put the following goals and initiatives in place based on the characteristics of each region. Systems and Initiatives for TEL Values A total of 14,479 employees are working at the 76 Tokyo Electron sites located in 18 countries and regions of the world, and we  believe that each of them maintaining a high level of engagement and demonstrating their full potential will lead directly to our  company’s growth. By sharing with our employees the direction toward which management is aiming and providing platforms  for direct dialogue through the employee meetings and discussions held every year at each site, we are striving to build mutual  trust between the organization and individuals. Furthermore, to realize our Corporate Philosophy, we established TEL Values,  which delineate Tokyo Electron’s values, the mindset that each employee must possess, and the codes of conduct to be passed  on to the future. The TEL Values—pride, challenge, ownership, teamwork, and awareness—are being put into practice by our  employees all over the world. Global Human Resources System The global human resources system introduced in fiscal year 2018 clarifies each employee's roles and responsibilities to  support talent management effectively. In coordination with development programs, Tokyo Electron supports the career  development and growth of our employees by presenting the skills required for a variety of jobs in the company, the  knowledge they should/can acquire and a description of expected duties at higher levels. We are also working to build  workplaces where diverse individuals can flourish by conducting talent assessments across all countries and regions, realizing  fair total rewards for employees and utilizing a performance management system and a global common human resource  system. Human Resource Concept at TEL UNIVERSITY We have established TEL UNIVERSITY as an in-house educational  establishment, helping employees to independently build their  careers and realize their personal goals for their growth and  development. Our aim is to stand shoulder to shoulder with each  employee, supporting their self-growth and fruitful career  development throughout their working life, and create a foundation  that enables the organization and individuals to trust each other and  grow. TEL UNIVERSITY plays an important part in helping employees  realize our vision of being “a truly global company generating high  added value and profits in the semiconductor and flat panel display  industries through innovative technologies and groundbreaking  proactive solutions that integrate diverse technologies”. Through the  following four initiatives, we are focusing on employee growth that  leads to corporate growth. Provision of Personalized Learning Opportunities Since each employee’s growth is different, we are putting effort into the practice of on-demand education* as a  mechanism that allows individuals to learn as they want, when they want, and according to their own needs. In  addition to group training, by proactively utilizing e-learning programs, we are providing opportunities for employees  to learn from any location. Challenge  We accept the challenge of going beyond what others are doing in pursuing our goal of becoming  number one globally.  Ownership We will keep ownership in mind as we think things through, and engage in thorough  implementation in order to achieve our goals. Teamwork  We respect each other's individuality and we place a high priority on teamwork. Awareness We must have awareness and accept responsibility for our behavior as respectful members of  society. Pride  We take pride in providing high-value products and services. * On-demand education:  Education programs  that allow employees to  learn at their own  convenience, anywhere,  anytime Support for Career Development We are expanding programs designed for employees to quickly acquire basic skills according to their different levels  and goals through our global human resources system. Effort is being put into providing information and tools so that  employees can gain a more concrete image of their own learning, experience and career development. Leader Programs In nurturing the next generation of leaders to support our future, we are globally expanding our succession programs  to identify and systematically nurture staff to take on the role of realizing medium- to long-term improvement of  corporate value. Selected next-generation management candidates are provided growth opportunities with an eye to  the future through participation in events such as external training, building networks outside the company, and  cultivating a broader perspective. Provision of Global Learning Opportunities For employees to acquire skills related to their duties and to gain a broader insight, we encourage them to actively  participate in both internal and external seminars. We are also moving to standardize our core programs on a global  basis so that employees are able to learn using our consistent group content and guidelines regardless of whether they  are in Japan or overseas. Work Styles Tokyo Electron recommends work styles that incorporate work-life balance and continuously develops  work  environments to enable this. We are promoting efficient ways of working suited to our employees' lifestyles and social  situations so that our employees can make the most of their work hours by utilizing a teleworking system in addition  to a flextime system. Leave System Based on the belief that taking appropriate leave and properly  managing work hours also contributes to better employee  productivity, we strive to correct long work hours and aim to enhance  the leave system and promote taking leave. Since fiscal year 2019, we have set an annual target of 70% annual  paid leave use and have promoted employee awareness for planned  use of leave. We are also promoting regular monitoring of leave use status and urging management to improve leave  use rates, ensuring that five days of compulsory annual leave are taken as required by law since April 2019. In fiscal year  2021, the leave use rates were 62.5% in Japan and 75.3% overseas, affected by COVID-19. We will continue to encourage  our employees to take annual paid leave. Our goal is to provide refreshment for employees and thereby boost their motivation to work. The system grants  special (paid) leave from two weeks to one month per five years of service to employees who have worked for more  than 10 years. In fiscal year 2021, 688 employees in Japan and 547 employees overseas took refreshment leave. In addition, to the system made available by existing laws, we are independently building a substantial framework  that allows employees to adopt a flexible approach to work that accords with diverse life events such as raising  children or caring for family members. With regard to the situation in Japan, we have acknowledged the maximum  extension of the childcare leave period to the day a child reaches three years of age, as well as expanding our provision  of a reduced working-hours program for childcare to include employees rearing children as far as graduation from  elementary school. In addition to nationally mandated leave to care for a sick or injured child, we enhance our support  system by establishing our own childcare leave, nursing care leave, etc. Human Rights Initiatives In fiscal year 2018, we formulated our Human Rights Policy1, summarizing our approach to human rights. We have specified the  human rights we believe are particularly important in business activities as Freedom, Equality & Non-Discrimination; Freely  Chosen Employment; Product Safety & Workplace Health and Safety; Freedom of Association; and Appropriate Working Hours  & Breaks/Holidays/Vacations. In preparing the Human Rights Policy, we referred to the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on  Business and Human Rights and the International Bill of Human Rights and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and  Rights at Work referred to therein, the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, and the RBA Code of Conduct2. We ensure that our executives and employees, as well as suppliers, are fully aware of this content. Specifically, we  publish the Human Rights Policy on our website to make it available to everyone inside and outside the Company, and  also implement online human rights training targeting all of our executives and employees. In fiscal year 2021, as in the previous fiscal year, we conducted human rights due diligence, as well as risk surveys,  and identified and assessed impacts. As part of the surveys, we utilized a self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) for  internal use, based on the RBA Code of Conduct, and also reviewed the results of a CSR assessment3 for suppliers of  materials, staffing and logistics to assess the current situation throughout the value chain. We are using the results of  these surveys to consider corrective actions and reduce human rights risks. Approach to Human Rights Conscious of our corporate social responsibility, Tokyo Electron recognizes that it is important to conduct ourselves  with a strong sense of integrity. Based on this recognition, we have firmly upheld human rights since our founding, as  reflected in the spirit of our Corporate Philosophy and Management Policies. For us, respecting human rights means a  significant undertaking, not only to fulfill our responsibility for eliminating adverse impacts on people caused through  business activities, but also to respect those people who support our business activities, and contribute to the  realization of a sustainable, dream-inspiring society. We incorporate the concept of respect into every aspect of our  business activities, and strive to nurture a dynamic corporate culture where each person can realize his or her full  potential. 1 Human Rights Policy www.tel.com/csr/ employee/diversity/ 2 RBA Code of Conduct:  The RBA establishes a set  of standards for supply  chains in the electronics  industry for a safe labor  environment to ensure  that workers are treated  with respect and dignity  and that companies take  responsibility for  environmental impact in  the manufacturing  process. 3 CSR assessment: Refer  to Supply Chain  Management on p. 54 Health and Productivity Management Having every employee find fulfillment in both work and life and achieve their maximum performance is also  important for the future advancement of Tokyo Electron. To create healthy and comfortable workplaces for  employees, we are working to develop our systems further. Besides conducting various medical checkups in  accordance with the law, we offer face-to-face consultations by designated occupational health physicians for  employees who work long hours. We also offer counseling opportunities supported by external industrial counselors  for those who request them. Furthermore, we are working on strengthening health-related support, organizing  regular line-care1 seminars aimed at management, and, where necessary, holding liaison meetings with the health  officers and health professionals at each Group company in Japan. Based on the collaborative health2 concept, in  cooperation with the Tokyo Electron Health Insurance Society, we are actively expanding data health3 initiatives,  providing employees health guidance and effective prevention and health promotion according to their individual  circumstances by utilizing examination data from medical checkups. As a result, the health literacy of employees in  fiscal year 2021 rose, demonstrated, for instance, by an increase in the percentage of employees receiving specific  health guidance4. Furthermore, again in fiscal year 2021, as in fiscal year 2020, the entire Group in Japan collectively  received recognition as top 500 companies under the 2021 Certified Health & Productivity Management  Outstanding Organizations Recognition Program5. We will continue to promote various initiatives at the global level  to maintain and improve our employees' health. We recognize the importance of having highly effective grievance mechanisms related to human rights and are  working to establish and operate those mechanisms. In fiscal year 2021, we further strengthened our internal and  external reporting systems in Japan and overseas for employees and suppliers. By continuing to conduct human rights due diligence going forward, we will assess and correct any human rights  issues we identify in our business activities and further improve the grievance mechanisms we provide. Supplier Human Rights Risk Survey Results The results of human rights risk surveys conducted at suppliers showed that 35% of those with 500 or more  employees had potential/actual risks. Among these risks, the major risks are health and safety issues related to  human rights, followed by labor issues. Based on these results, we continued to request those suppliers to  comply with domestic laws and regulations and social norms related to health and safety. We will work to  reduce human rights risks by promoting corrective actions together with our suppliers.  Meanwhile, inside our company, we identified potential human rights risks in the areas of labor, and health  and safety. To mitigate these risks, we are renewing our efforts to fully manage working hours and also taking  steps to improve operational efficiency further. 3 Data health: Refers to a  more effective and  efficient health care  program that is  implemented in line with  the health status of  insured persons, by  utilizing and analyzing  the health and medical  information held  electronically by the  medical insurer 4 Specific health guidance:  Health guidance  provided for reducing  the number of people  with metabolic  syndrome (visceral fat  syndrome) or at risk of  metabolic syndrome,  and for the early  detection and early  treatment of lifestyle  diseases and cancer, etc. To eliminate incidents, we also provide online training and risk assessment training for employees in Japan and  overseas. Also, to expand the concept of safe equipment design2 to our design, manufacture, and service operations,  we hold a semiannual safe equipment design seminar at our manufacturing sites in Japan, inviting an external guest to  speak. Finally, we also promote our initiatives to prevent accidents, such as providing our suppliers and customers with  safety information as circumstances demand. As a result of having maintained a high priority on creating safe work environments, TCIR3 has been maintained at  less than the company’s target of 0.5, with 0.27 in fiscal year 2021. Safety Management Framework Based on a culture of “Safety First,” we carry out ongoing activities for safety promotion. In an effort to raise the  overall level of safety and occupational health, we use a management system based on OHSMS1 to manage safety and  occupational health and also follow the PDCA cycle to reduce the potential risk of work-related incidents. Moreover,  by sharing information of any issues at internal meetings, such as those of the EHS Council and the Manufacturing  Company Presidents’ Council, we promote safety management as a company-wide initiative. Incident Reporting System If an incident occurs, the information is shared with related parties and persons in charge through the TEL Incident  Report System (TIRS), newly developed in fiscal year 2019, creating a system that resolves issues and leads to the  proposal of measures to prevent reoccurrence. Through the operation of TIRS, we strive to improve the accuracy of  report content further. On-site Safety Patrols At each plant and office, monthly safety and health committee meetings are held to discuss measures for any  workplace safety or employee health issues and to conduct safety patrols. We have also set up a system for  autonomous problem-solving at manufacturing sites, with safety patrols by representatives from appropriate  departments at least once per month. Risk Assessment and Stop Work Authority Before starting work at our manufacturing facilities, the work details and the risks are shared with all workers involved,  and they each increase their awareness in an effort to prevent incidents. In addition, effort is also being directed to  providing guidance to safety managers as well as making workers stop work and take corrective action in the event of  an unforeseen incident while on the job. Safety Education In addition, we are implementing two education programs globally for the  establishment of safe work environments. ■ Basic Safety Education Our program on basic safety targeting all employees. This is provided as  introductory training for new hires as well as refresher training every third  year of employment. ■ Advanced Safety Education Our program on advanced safety targets employees working on production lines and in cleanrooms. Participants are  required to complete the course every year. For overseas transferees, the laws and regulations in their previous and  future places of employment are compared, and additional safety education is added as necessary. 2 Safe equipment design:  Refer to p. 25 3 TCIR: Total Case  Incident Rate. The  number of workplace  incidents per 200,000  work hours. Environmental Management System Environmental issues such as climate change are growing ever more crucial. To promote activities in the medium to long  term that meet the environmental/ESG needs of its customers and other stakeholders, the Manufacturing Company  Presidents’ Council, which includes the corporate director in charge of EHS, monitors and supervises progress related to  environmental issues. A headquarters has been established, headed by the corporate director in charge of EHS, and  promotes environmental activities across the entire Group. The Environment Council, made up of members appointed by  the executives of the Group companies, sets targets related to environmental issues, monitors progress and also works to  achieve its goals. Furthermore, to continuously promote our environmental activities, we have operated an  environmental management system based on ISO 14001 since fiscal year 1998, primarily at our manufacturing  subsidiaries. In March 2017, we acquired multi-site ISO 14001 certification for our plants and offices in Japan that had  previously acquired certification separately. Coinciding with this multi-site certification, we have developed a  standardized group format for environmental impact assessments, the identification of useful environmental aspects,  environmental management programs and internal audit checklists. During fiscal year 2021, we established approximately  100 environmental goals for different levels across the entire Group and carried out these improvement activities. Any  issues identified through these activities are reviewed by the Environment Council, reported to the Manufacturing  Company Presidents’ Council and used for promoting environmental activities across the entire Group. Under such an  environment management system, fiscal year 2021 was again free from environmental incidents, accidents, violations,  and associated legal proceedings. Environmental Risks and Opportunities The various issues related to the environmental impact on our daily lives and the business activities of companies.  Physical risks, such as rising average global temperatures, strong winds, disasters, and water shortages caused by  climate change and abnormal weather, heighten the risks in business, such as damage to assets, increased operating  costs, and impacts on the supply chain. In terms of legal risks, we recognize that stronger environmental laws and  regulations, more stringent regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, the introduction of carbon taxes, and so on will  lead to higher costs for associated measures. At the same time, promoting environmental initiatives leads to more  opportunities to sell outstanding, environmentally friendly products, reduce operating costs, and further improve  corporate value. As a participant in the semiconductor and flat panel display (FPD) industry, by leveraging Tokyo  Electron’s advanced technological prowess to create added value, we can contribute to the creation of semiconductor  and FPD products with low power consumption and the building of an energy-saving society that makes the most of  information technology. Based on the requirements of ISO 14001, we identified and analyzed internal and external issues in relation to the  environment, namely, our relationship with the climate, air quality, and water quality. We also clarified the  environmental needs and expectations of customers, suppliers, governments, and employees and identified the  compliance obligations of our group. From this information, we defined the following as its risks and opportunities to  address: (1) environmental management by reducing the environmental impact of its business activities, (2)  compliance with applicable laws, and (3) enhancing product competitiveness with the environmental contribution of  products. Initiatives Related to Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) We are pursuing ongoing disclosures and initiatives based on the TCFD framework and relating to risks and  opportunities that climate change presents to our business. ■ Governance Each of our corporate directors for EHS and CSR is working under the supervision of the CEO to monitor progress of  goals related to our response to climate change. With the establishment of the EHS Promotion Department and CSR Operations Department at headquarters, these  activities are being driven by the entire Group. At the Environmental Council, comprised of members appointed by  executives of the Group companies, company-wide goals are set, progress is monitored and the achievement of these  goals is promoted. ■ Strategy Utilizing the framework of the TCFD recommendations, we identified the risks and opportunities of climate change  that will impact business over the medium to long term. We have evaluated the quantitative impact on business  from some of those risks and opportunities, and we aim to continue quantifying others going forward as we  investigate relevant measures. ■ Risk Management Through the Manufacturing Company Presidents’ Council, we approve company-wide risk management initiatives,  from short term to long term, that related divisions and councils recommend, and then apply those initiatives to the  facilities and divisions of the Group companies. For Scope 11 and 22 CO2 emissions, we are adopting renewable energy from a global perspective, including the  implementation of measures at our key manufacturing sites in Japan with high emissions.  For Scope 33 emissions, we recognize the importance of providing products that generate fewer CO2 emissions  because about 88% of the emissions in our entire value chain are generated during use of products after sale, so we  are focusing on the development of a range of environmental technologies. We also formulate business continuity plans in anticipation of natural disasters caused by abnormal weather and  other factors, and take measures with our suppliers to ensure that business operations can be maintained. ■ Metrics and Targets To further reinforce our initiatives toward improving environmental performance of products and conserving the  environment at our plants and offices, we revised our medium-term environmental goals in December 20204. While  supporting the advancement of information and communications technology through the provision of our  semiconductor and FPD production equipment, we are also committed to achieving new environmental goals in  keeping with our Corporate Philosophy: “We strive to contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring society  through our leading-edge technologies and reliable service and support”. ■	 Increased energy costs in line with taxes on fuel and energy  Assuming our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and use of renewable energy remain at fiscal year 2021 levels, if a carbon tax  were applied, we estimate our costs would increase by 1.1 billion yen/year by fiscal year 2026 (assuming a tax of 6,000 yen per  ton CO2) and 2.6 billion yen/year by fiscal year 2041 (14,000 yen per ton CO2) 3 Scope 3: Emissions  from corporate value  chains (excluding scope  1 and 2 emissions), such  as product  transportation,  employee business  travel and major  outsourced production  processes * Scope 3 is divided into  upstream activities,  which include emissions  associated with  purchased or procured  products and services,  and downstream  activities, which include  emissions associated  with sold products and  services. 4 Revision of medium- term environmental  targets: Refer to p. 50 Medium- and Long-term Environmental Goals In order to further strengthen our initiatives toward the environment in our products, plants and offices, the contents of the  medium-term environmental goals for fiscal year 2031 were revised in December 2020. In the goals for products, the  reference year for per-wafer CO2 emissions was changed from fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2019. In addition, in the goals for  plants and offices, the total CO2 emissions reduction goal was changed from 20% reduction to 70% reduction while reaching a  rate of 100% renewable energy usage. At present, we are working on new initiatives toward achieving these revised goals.  Specifically, we are planning to introduce renewable energy at our plants and offices in Japan, the United States and China  starting from fiscal year 2022. This will bring our use of renewable energy company-wide to over 50% while dropping our CO2  emissions by 40%. In terms of products, we are moving ahead with understanding the amount of CO2 emissions during the  use of standard equipment and creating a roadmap. We are rolling out activities toward achieving our goals based on this. We have set the following as a long-term goal to achieve by 2050. As a leading corporation in environmental management,  Tokyo Electron works actively to conserve the global environment. We strive to contribute to the development of a dream- inspiring society by proactively promoting the reduction of environmental burden of both our products, facilities, and at the  same time, providing evolutionary manufacturing technologies that effectively reduce the power consumption of electronic  products. We are working on initiatives for this at a company-wide level. Our total CO2 emissions of Scope 1 and Scope 2 is 186 kilotons, while Scope 3 accounts for a total of 6,222 kilotons,  approximately 97% of the total. Of this, CO2 emissions when using products is 5,668 kilotons, about 88% of the total.  This is why we consider the development of products with low CO2 emissions during operation to be important. CO2 Emissions Across the Value Chain We will work to grasp the environmental impact throughout the value chain and develop business activities that are conscious  of reducing this impact. Based on our environmental slogan “Technology for Eco Life,” we aim to resolve environmental  problems through leading technology and reliable services. Kawai, CEO / Top Management Conference / 2021.5.25 1 As a leading corporation in environmental management, Tokyo Electron works actively to conserve the global  environment. We strive to contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring society by proactively promoting the  reduction of environmental burden of both our products, facilities, and at the same time, providing evolutionary  manufacturing technologies that effectively reduce the power consumption of electronic products. As a leading corporation in environmental management, Tokyo Electron works actively to conserve the global  environment. We strive to contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring society by proactively promoting  the reduction of environmental burden of both our products, facilities, and at the same time, providing  evolutionary manufacturing technologies that efectively reduce the power consumption of electronic products. Products that Contribute to a Sustainable Society Of the CO2 emissions from our value chain, emissions during product use account for about 88%. For this reason, we have made  it a key corporate objective to promote environmentally friendly product design and lower the energy consumption of our  products. In fiscal year 2021, we moved ahead with setting out a roadmap for key models to reach our medium-term  environmental goal to reduce per-wafer CO2 emissions by 30% by fiscal year 2031 (compared with fiscal year 2019) for the key  models of each business unit, and have established guidelines for calculating CO2 emissions that include the amounts of process  gases and chemical substances to use, as well as the area, volume and mass occupied by equipment, in addition to our existing  ones for energy and water. Based on these guidelines, we have begun estimating CO2 emission levels for equipment using our  base year (fiscal year 2019), and have also started studying environmental technology strategies. As we work to further raise  environmental awareness, we will continue to incorporate environmental technologies as an important added value in our  technological strategies through various activities. Initiatives to Prevent Global Warming and Save Energy As our medium-term environmental goal, we want to reduce total CO2 emissions by 70% by fiscal year 2031  (compared with fiscal year 2019) at our plants and offices, and have set the goal of reducing energy consumption by at  least 1% year-over-year at each of our plants and offices. To achieve this goal, we have brought in a number of  initiatives, including our energy-saving clean room operation, setting office air conditioning at appropriate  temperatures, introducing devices that offer superior energy-saving performance, and bringing in renewable energy.  As a result of these activities, we managed to reduce by 10% year-over-year the amount of energy used at our plants  and offices per net sales in fiscal year 2021. In addition, the increase in the amount of energy used to develop and  evaluate products and increase production meant that our power consumption was 355 GWh (12% increase YoY), and  the CO27 emitted by our energy sources was 169 kilotons (9% increase YoY). In addition, in fiscal year 2019, we revised  the per-unit basis for plants and offices in Japan to more appropriate levels based on the correlation between business  Initiatives for Product Environmental Laws and Regulations In order to comply with each country’s environmental laws and regulations pertaining to products, we proactively collect  information and take appropriate action as required. An example of our efforts for EU REACH2 is that we properly  investigate and disclose information on the presence of any chemical substances in articles. We introduced the  chemSHERPA3 format in fiscal year 2021 and collected information on chemical substances for concentrations in the parts  per billion (ppb4). As an effort toward GHS5 requirements, we provide safety data sheets (SDS6) when selling chemical  products. We also promote the local procurement of chemical products and effectively address laws and regulations. In  explaining and addressing the frequently revised environmental laws and regulations, we continue to offer “web-based  training for Product Environment Compliance” to all employees, and we provide suppliers with information on the  relevant environmental laws and regulations. We will continue to monitor each country’s environmental laws and  regulations rapidly and strive to take appropriate action. Renewable Energy Initiatives We have set as a medium-term environmental goal the use of 100% renewable energy sources at our plants and  offices by fiscal year 2031. To reach this goal, we are planning to introduce renewable energy at our sites in Japan, the  United States and China, starting from fiscal year 2022. This will bring our use of renewable energy company-wide to  over 50%, while dropping our CO2 emissions by 40%. As an initiative toward in-house generation of renewable energy, at Tokyo Electron Miyagi (Taiwa Office) and Tokyo  Electron Technology Solutions (Fujii Office, Hosaka Office), renewable energy generated from solar panels is used to  power the plants, and monitors displaying their energy profile have been set up at the entrances to the plants. At  Tokyo Electron Kyushu (Koshi Office), generated energy is sold, helping to prevent global warming. In fiscal year 2021,  we generated a total of 4,068 MWh of renewable energy in Japan. In addition, Tokyo Electron U.S. Holdings has  continued to purchase green power from external sources, amounting to 4,980 MWh in fiscal year 2021. ■ Example initiative In our Cellcia™ series of test systems, we have improved the cooling circuits in the cooling chiller, increasing  efficiency and boosting cooling capacity by 30%. This has enabled us to make the cooling chiller smaller, reducing  our equipment footprint1. In addition, we have brought in new functions to automatically switch off heaters and  chillers inside our Precio™ series of wafer probers when idling. 7 The emission  coefficient for power  consumption in Japan in  fiscal year 2021 uses the  post-adjustment  emission coefficient on  a per-electricity  supplier basis, while the  emission coefficients  for power consumption  overseas uses the  emission coefficients in  Emissions Factors 2019  Edition issued by the  International Energy  Agency (IEA). Initiatives to Reduce Waste To curb the amount of waste generated and to recycle it wherever possible,  we promote initiatives to reduce waste. In addition to participating in the  electronic manifest system2 to ensure proper waste management, we are  engaged in maintaining an appropriate amount of parts inventory and in  reusing cushioning material. We are also achieving lower waste processing  costs by promoting waste sorting activities and by modifying space used for  storing waste to increase storage capacity and reduce the frequency of  collection. In fiscal year 2021, we surveyed waste disposal operators in Japan using a unified on-site checklist, and we  shared the results. As a result of these initiatives, in fiscal year 2021, we generated 183 tons of incinerated and landfill  waste, and the recycling rate3 was 98.8%, achieving our single-year goal of maintaining a recycling rate of 97% or  higher for the 15th consecutive year since fiscal year 2007. We have also maintained a high level of recycling of 95% at  our overseas plants and offices. ■ Example initiative At the Chaska Office of TEL Manufacturing and Engineering of America, wood recycling is encouraged, and in  addition, packaging materials that would normally be sent to landfills are converted to heat or power generation  materials. The recycling rate was 85% in fiscal year 2020 but climbed 14 points in fiscal year 2021 to reach 99%. ■ Example initiative 1 We are bringing in a system at our manufacturing sites in Japan to make it clear how much energy is saved at our  plants and offices. Previously, we used to graph changes by extracting data by hand, but now, through integrated  management on the cloud, we can check changes at any time, as well as check the deployment and effects of BKM1  at each plant and study or implement measures. This system is scheduled to be fully in place by fiscal year 2022. ■ Example initiative 2 The new manufacturing wing that started operation at the Tokyo Electron Technology Solutions (Fujii Office) in August  2020 uses energy-saving air-conditioning equipment, allowing it to save an expected 30% of energy or more in terms of  floor area. ■ Example initiative 3 At Tokyo Electron Kyushu (Koshi Office), heat source chillers that used to be controlled, managed and run  independently have been switched to integrated operation. This is expected to save about 470 MWh and 170 t-CO2  annually going forward. operations and energy, sharing these and putting them into practice. Specifically, the per-unit basis is calculated by  compound weighting using data on the number of development and evaluation machines, production volume, floor  space, and man-hours in each region. As a result, the goal has been achieved at 1 of the 11 total plants and offices in  Japan and overseas. Initiatives to Reduce Water Consumption With the growing importance of water resource preservation in global  environmental initiatives, we have established a goal of keeping water  consumption at the same level or below that of the baseline year (fiscal  year 2012 for plants and offices in Japan and a fiscal year of their  choosing for each overseas operation). Our ongoing efforts to achieve  these goals include reusing pure water from our manufacturing  operations, installing water-saving devices, watering lawns with  rainwater, and implementing the intermittent operation of cafeteria  faucets. During fiscal year 2021, as a consequence of new buildings  coming online and an increase in water consumption associated with  product development and evaluation, water consumption amounted to  1,397,000 m3, up 7% year-over-year. Moreover, in terms of our goal of  maintaining water consumption at the baseline level (per-unit basis) at  each plant and office, we achieved 10 of the 13 goals. Additionally, an  estimated 1,195,000 m3 of wastewater was discharged in fiscal year 2021. 98.8% 2 Electronic manifest  system: A system for  electronically tracking  the flow of industrial  waste instead of using  paper-based manifests  (i.e., paper forms for  tracking industrial  waste). The system uses  a communications  network of data  processing centers,  businesses that generate  waste, and waste  collection/disposal  companies. Logistics Initiatives We have been promoting activities designed to reduce the environmental impact of our logistics. We have been  implementing a modal shift2 from air to ocean transportation for the overseas shipping of our semiconductor and FPD  production equipment, and at the same time, we have been working hard to reduce production lead times. We have also  been endeavoring to reduce CO2 emissions and costs by adopting the shelved trolleys traditionally used in shipping FPD  production equipment to semiconductor production equipment, thereby improving the load factor of trucks.  In fiscal year 2021, we set a new environmental goal for logistics to reduce the amount of wooden packaging  materials used by 50% (packaging for semiconductor production equipment fiscal year 2024). We will continue to  promote activities that contribute to the achievement of this goal. Environmental Communication Our environmental policy requires that we promote cooperative partnerships with our stakeholders and respond  appropriately as a company to their expectations and wishes. In promoting initiatives for the environment, we  maintain close communication with all our stakeholders. We are introducing online environmental education programs to better promote environmental communication  internally. Our online programs consist of an environmental program for new employees and mid-career recruits, plus  a refresher program for existing employees. In fiscal year 2021, we carried out refresher programs for existing  employees, which about 8,000 people in Japan attended. E-COMPASS We established E-COMPASS (Environmental Co-Creation by Material,  Process and Subcomponent Solutions) as a new supply chain sustainability  initiative. E-COMPASS aims to align our products and the entire operations  more closely with our environmental mandates, strengthen our ties with  business partners, solidify our industry leadership, and pave the way for a  sustainable future. We will utilize every management resource at our  disposal to drive the major trends of digitalization and greening of society  and actively endeavor to preserve the global environment throughout the  supply chain. Management of Chemical Substances We constantly monitor and manage our use and release of any chemical substances used in product development and  manufacturing subject to the Japanese PRTR1 law. Whenever we introduce a new chemical substance or change the  way an existing substance is used, we check for environmental, health, and safety risks beforehand and conduct  appropriate processing after use by contracting expert vendors and using in-house processing facilities. In response to  the Fluorocarbons Recovery and Destruction Law, we conduct simple checks, regular inspections and so on based on  law in an effort to monitor the amounts of fluorocarbons filled and recovered. In fiscal year 2021, none of our plants or  offices had fluorocarbon leakages requiring notification. Biodiversity In carrying out our business activities, we have a not insignificant impact on biodiversity, and yet without the benefits  yielded from biodiversity, we could not sustain our activities. In recognition of this, we will develop a framework for  promoting initiatives to conserve biodiversity. We set a single fiscal year goal of conducting at least two ecosystem  tours or conservation activities at our plants and offices in Japan. Results in fiscal year 2021 show that a total of 18  events were held, attracting a total of 52 participants. Green Procurement We began implementing our Green Procurement Guidelines in January 2001 and have since promoted green  procurement, prioritizing the purchase of environmentally friendly parts and products. Through these guidelines, we  strive to gain the understanding and cooperation of our suppliers with respect to building environmental management  systems, monitoring, reducing and disclosing information on the environmental impacts of business activities, and  developing environmentally friendly products. www.tel.com/csr/environment/green-procurement/ URL www.tel.com/csr/environment/product/ URL www.tel.com/csr/environment/office/ URL www.tel.com/csr/environment/office/ URL Responsible Procurement of Minerals (Conflict Minerals) We regard taking action against conflict minerals (3TG4) obtained through illegal exploitation, including sources with  human rights violations or poor working conditions, as an important part of corporate social responsibility. Our resolute  goal is to eliminate the use of raw materials made from these conflict minerals, as well as any parts or components  containing them. We conduct surveys on conflict materials using the CMRT5 and referring to the OECD6 Due Diligence  Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. In fiscal year 2021, we  conducted our seventh annual survey on potential conflict minerals, and as a result, we were able to identify 236 RMAP7  conformant smelters, providing us confidence that 3TG sourced from these smelters were conflict-free. In addition, none  of the materials we procured were found to contain 3TG involved in conflict. Principles and System of Supply Chain Management To make its entire supply chain sound and sustainable, Tokyo Electron has formulated a procurement policy based on the  laws, regulations and social norms of each country, as well as the RBA Code of Conduct, and is promoting activities based on  this policy by disseminating it throughout the Company and its suppliers. We also promote improvement activities from  various perspectives while valuing continuous communication with diverse suppliers, including materials suppliers that  handle parts and raw materials, staffing suppliers that provide services and logistics suppliers that handle physical  distribution operations.  We strive to create value in the supply chain by working to build relationships of trust with our suppliers, who support our  business as partners, and by working together to conduct operations in compliance with global standards. Under the  leadership of the Representative Director, President & CEO, issues identified during various activities are shared with relevant  divisions for consideration and action on specific improvements. CSR Operations To keep track of our suppliers’ engagement in CSR activities, we have conducted a CSR assessment in areas such as  labor, health and safety, the environment and ethics since fiscal year 2014. We analyze the results of the assessments,  provide feedback and work together with our suppliers to remediate any issues. In fiscal year 2019, we completely  revised the content of the survey based on audit standards stipulated by the RBA and have since conducted surveys  on materials1, staffing2 and logistics3 suppliers. In fiscal year 2021, with the help and understanding of our suppliers, steps were taken to repay workers with respect  to cases of an employment-related expense burden for forced labor and bonded labor, which had been identified in  the previous fiscal year and which have been given particular emphasis in the RBA Code of Conduct. In addition, with  respect to cases of false reporting, changes were made in business processes and audits were introduced.  Regarding the human rights issue of “freely chosen employment,” we have expressly stipulated our zero-tolerance  policy for forced labor and bonded labor, and by communicating this to our major suppliers, we are promoting  initiatives to ensure that all people in our supply chain can work of their own free will. Procurement BCP As part of our business continuity plans (BCPs), we collaborate with suppliers for  disaster preparation. We maintain a database of suppliers’ production sites so that if a  crisis arises, we can promptly identify impacted suppliers and quickly collaborate in  recovery efforts. During fiscal year 2021, about 22,000 supplier sites were registered,  and post-disaster impact surveys were conducted five times. In addition, we conduct BCP assessments8 on our suppliers, analyze their responses  and provide them with feedback to promote further improvement. In the fiscal year  2021 assessment, improvements in the overall rating level were observed at 20% of  suppliers, and improvements in the overall raw score were seen at 43%. China 3.5% U.S. 2.0% Taiwan 1.1% Other 4.8% Japan 88.6% 1 Material suppliers:  Surveys have been  conducted since fiscal  year 2014 for suppliers  accounting for more  than 80% of our  procurement spend. 2 Staffing suppliers:  Surveys have been  conducted since fiscal  year 2019 on 100% of  employment agencies  and contracting  companies (internal  contractors). 3 Logistics suppliers:  Surveys have been  conducted since fiscal  year 2019 on 100% of  customs-related  operators. 5 CMRT: Conflict Minerals  Reporting Template.  Survey format for  reporting conflict  materials, provided by  the Responsible  Minerals Initiative  (RMI), which has  established  international guidelines  on conflict minerals. 7 RMAP: Responsible  Minerals Assurance  Process. A program  promoted and led by  the RMI for auditing  smelters/refiners that  do not use conflict  minerals. 8 BCP assessment: A  survey that has  continuously been  conducted to key  suppliers accounting for  more than 80% of our  procurement spend  since FY2013 Tokyo Electron’s social contribution activities aim to contribute to the resolution of social issues and the development of local  communities through various activities while deepening relationships of trust with all stakeholders. As a manufacturer of semiconductor and flat panel display production equipment, we have selected four focus areas. We place great  importance on innovation and technology, focus on the education of human resources to support them and aim to preserve the global  environment while, at the same time, ensuring communication and involvement with the communities where we are operating  worldwide. In addition to taking initiatives through business, we strive to help achieve the SDGs through the activities of TEL FOR GOOD. In support of activities to prevent the  spread of COVID-19 and in the hopes of  ending the pandemic and returning  people’s lives to normalcy as soon as  possible, we donated 100 million yen to  the International Federation of Red Cross  and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). After heavy rain caused flooding,  especially in the Kyushu region in  July 2020, we donated 100 million  yen to Kumamoto Prefecture to  help the flood victims and in the  hopes of quickly restoring the  affected areas. TEL FOR GOOD is the brand name  that represents our social  contribution activities. From fiscal  year 2019, we are using it as a  collective term for social  contribution events and various  programs, donations and volunteer  activities sponsored by our group  companies around the world. In collaboration with the Women in  Engineering Program at the  University of Texas at Austin, Tokyo  Electron America is promoting the  participation and advancement of  women in engineering fields.  Targeting girls up to junior high school, the program offers more than 150 STEM1  activities, with corporate partners and volunteers acting as hosts to provide the  students with opportunities to explore STEM themes. In fiscal year 2021, 10  Tokyo Electron America employees prepared for these activities and carried out  a project to help the students search for common elements found at home using  the AR-enhanced periodic table2. In support of the semiconductor scholarship  program sponsored by the Korea  Semiconductor Industry Association (KSIA),  Tokyo Electron Korea, together with  semiconductor manufacturers and device  manufacturers, has since 2008 been  providing scholarships to students who have  demonstrated excellence in the  semiconductor sector. Through fiscal year  2020, one science and engineering student majoring in semiconductors was  selected and awarded a semiconductor scholarship of approximately 1 million yen.  Starting in fiscal year 2021, the number of scholarship recipients was increased to  two. The scholarships are awarded during the commemorative ceremony for  Korean Semiconductor Day, which takes place on October 29 every year. To preserve the forest environment, Tokyo  Electron Miyagi has been continuously  planting trees since fiscal year 2018. In fiscal  year 2021, to prevent the spread of COVID-19,  a smaller, elite corps of eight employees  carried out various afforestation activities,  including thinning and tree planting, as well as  trail and bridge maintenance. To ensure their  effective utilization, the thinned trees were  used as teaching materials in elementary and junior high schools in Taiwa-cho,  where they were made into tops and flutes. Because of a lockdown due to COVID-19, Tokyo  Electron Europe organized a virtual running event  near the homes of participating employees. Each  team formed within the company set up a target  distance, which was run by individual employees  wearing T-shirts printed with the Tokyo Electron  logo. Tokyo Electron Europe contributed funds in  an amount matching the total distance run by  the participants. When added up, the donated  funds amounted to approximately 800 euros and were donated to Sonnenstrahl  e.V., a charitable organization located in Dresden serving cancer-afflicted children  and their family members. Japan Afforestation Activity “Tokyo Electron Forest” U.S. Girl Day at the University of Texas at Austin In Hsinchu, where Tokyo Electron Taiwan’s  headquarters is located, supplementary  Japanese lessons and presentations are held  for the children of expatriate Japanese  employees, targeting students of junior high  school age or younger. In fiscal year 2021, 36  students participated in these activities.  Volunteers handle everything in the  supplementary school, from administration to  the actual teaching, with two hours of Japanese language lessons offered every week.  Tokyo Electron Taiwan contributes funds every year to support the school’s activities,  which offer the students a rare and precious opportunity to study Japanese. Approximately 80% of Kumamoto  Prefecture’s water supply resources are  underground. For Kumamoto City in  particular, because 100% of the waterworks  are supplied by groundwater, preservation of  groundwater is an important activity for  securing future water resources.  Since 2006, Tokyo Electron Kyushu has  been working on broadleaf afforestation  suited to groundwater recharge in Nishihara Village, in the outer rim of southern  Mount Aso, and in fiscal year 2021, carried out brush clearing and supplementary  planting. So far, approximately 2,800 employees and family members have  participated in these activities, planting a total of 4.2 ha with 13,810 trees. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19,  Tokyo Electron Technology Solutions donated  10 million yen each to Yamanashi and Iwate  Prefectures, where its plants and offices are  located. The donated funds were utilized for  the two prefectures’ COVID-19-related  operations, such as purchasing equipment  that could quickly confirm PCR test results. Science Intercollegiate is an event for  university and technical college  students to present findings of their  own research. We have been a  featured sponsor since the first  competition. By providing an  opportunity to present their research,  the event aims to motivate students to  undertake research and to foster  original and richly creative scientists and engineers. The 10th Science Intercollegiate  was held online from January 25 to February 28, 2021, attended by 60 students  from 40 finalist groups, bringing the total number of students presenting their  research to more than 1,900 since the event’s inception.

(the “Company”).    The Company’s Responsibility  The Company is responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Information in accordance with the calculation  and reporting standard adopted by the Company (indicated with the Sustainability Information included in the  Report). CO2 quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty for reasons such as incomplete scientific knowledge  used to determine emissions factors and numerical data.    Our Independence and Quality Control  We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional  Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental  principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.  We apply International Standard on Quality Control 1, Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of  Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements, and accordingly maintain a  comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with  ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.    Our Responsibility  Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Sustainability Information based on the  procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement  in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (“ISAE”) 3000, Assurance Engagements  Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance  Standards Board (“IAASB”), ISAE 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the  IAASB and the Practical Guideline for the Assurance of Sustainability Information, issued by the Japanese  Association of Assurance Organizations for Sustainability Information.  The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment and included inquiries, observation of  processes performed, inspection of documents, analytical procedures, evaluating the appropriateness of quantification  methods and reporting policies, and agreeing or reconciling with underlying records. These procedures also included  the following:   ・  Evaluating whether the Company’s methods for estimates are appropriate and had been consistently applied.  However, our procedures did not include testing the data on which the estimates are based or reperforming the  estimates.  ・  Performing interviews of responsible persons and inspecting documentary evidence to assess the completeness  of the data, data collection methods, source data and relevant assumptions applicable to the sites.    The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent  than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance  engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable  assurance engagement.    Limited Assurance Conclusion  Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention  that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with  the calculation and reporting standard adopted by the Company.
